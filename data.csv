 Former Fox News star Carlson released a two-hour interview with Putin in Moscow last Thursday, just ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia's offensive in Ukraine.

ussian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said he was grateful to controversial right-wing US talk show host Tucker Carlson for his interview last week and ""intermediary"" role with the West.

Former Fox News star Carlson released a two-hour interview with Putin in Moscow last Thursday, just ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia's offensive in Ukraine.

In it, the Russian president said the West needed to understand that it was ""impossible"" for Russia to be defeated in Ukraine.

""Since we are not able to have direct dialogue (with the West) today... we have to be grateful to Mr Carlson to be able to do it by his intermediary"" role, Putin told journalists in quotes distributed by the Kremlin.

Even so, Putin said he was ""not totally satisfied"" with the interview, the first he has given to a Western journalist since launching his offensive in Ukraine.

It has been seen more than 200 million times on X, formerly Twitter.

Putin's disappointment, though, seemed to stem from his hopes for a more bellicose exchange, saying that he expected Carlson to be more ""aggressive"" and was waiting for ""difficult questions"".

""I was not only ready for that but I was hoping for it because that would have allowed me to reply in the same manner,"" Putin said.

Carlson came in for criticism from Western media for the lack of tough questions in the interview, in which Putin lectured him on his views of Russian history, portraying the country as a victim of Western betrayals.

Putin acknowledged that Carlson had ""tried to interrupt me several times"" but praised the conservative journalist, who is close to former US president Donald Trump, for his ""patience"".

The Russian leader did complain, though, that his quotes were ""deformed"" in Western media.

 Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has said Britain is in a “pre-war world” and cannot afford to reduce spending on the military.

In a major speech at Lancaster House in London, Mr. Shapps said the “peace dividend” that followed the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s was over.

Mr. Shapps said: “Because the era of the peace dividend is over, in five years’ time we could be looking at multiple theatres including Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.”

“Ask yourself, looking at today’s conflicts across the world, is it more likely that that number grows or reduces? I suspect we all know the answer. It’s likely to grow,” he added.

Mr. Shapps also announced 20,000 British service personnel would take part in NATO’s largest military exercises since the Cold War, following the announcement last week of a £2.5 billion support package to Ukraine.

Over the weekend the RAF carried out air strikes with U.S. forces on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, after they targeted merchant shipping in their campaign against Israel.

The British government has set a goal of increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP, but Mr. Shapps has argued it should rise to 3 percent.

His speech on Monday—in front of an audience including top brass in the British military—might be seen as pushing the argument for increased defence spending.

Mr. Shapps said, “We made the critical decision to set out our aspiration to reach 2.5 percent of GDP on defence, and as we stabilise and grow this economy we’ll continue to strive to reach that as soon as possible.”

“But now is the time for all allied and democratic nations across the world to do the same thing and ensure their defence spending is growing too,” he added.

‘The Tanks Are Literally on Europe’s Ukrainian Lawn’The defence secretary said: “An age of idealism has been replaced by a period of hard-headed realism. Today our adversaries are busy rebuilding their barriers, old enemies are reanimated, new foes are taking shape, battle lines are being redrawn.”

“The tanks are literally on Europe’s Ukrainian lawn and the foundations of the world order being shaken to their core,” he added.

Mr. Shapps refused to rule out further action against the Houthis following the weekend attacks.

He said the strike against the Houthis was a “single action” but added, “We will now monitor very carefully to see what they do next, how they respond and we will see from there.”

Later Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would “not hesitate” to protect British shipping in the Red Sea.

Mr. Sunak told Sky News, “As we’ve said, not just to the Houthis but to their Iranian masters, in a sense, because they are really proxies for Tehran, this cannot go on.”

“Freedom of navigation is just a given and always has been for many years. We cannot have that situation where they are trying to harass it, and we will keep a very close eye. If we have to take further action, that is something that we will consider,” he said.

He added, “They should be aware that if it doesn’t stop then of course we will then have to take the decisions that need to be taken.”",['Other'],['Other']
2,EN_UA_000543.txt,"Ukraine Appeals for Calm, Says Russian Invasion Not Imminent 

 A top Ukrainian official has appealed for calm as he reassured the nation that an invasion from neighboring Russia was not imminent—despite officials acknowledging there is a real threat as NATO allies have ramped up defenses in the Baltic Sea region this week.

Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s Minister of Defense, said on Monday that at this time, “there are no grounds to believe” that Moscow is preparing an invasion very soon and there is no need for citizens “to have [their] bags packed.”

“Don’t worry, sleep well,” he said, adding that “there are risky scenarios. They’re possible and probable in the future,” though at this time “such a threat doesn’t exist.”

On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also told the nation that the situation is “under control,” while Reznikov affirmed Russia had not formed what he called battle groups, “which would have indicated that tomorrow they could launch an offensive.”

Reznikov’s and Zelensky’s statement in a bid to project calm in order not to destabilize the situation and avoid panic comes as another multi-million dollar shipment of U.S. military equipment arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday.

“Our partners are increasing the amount of military assistance. And today we are meeting the third aircraft from the United States government as part of this assistance,” the defense minister said at a press briefing before the aircraft loaded with defensive aid totaling about $200 million landed at an airport in the capital of Ukraine.

Moscow has repeatedly denied intentions to invade Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the West is showing “hysteria” and is putting out information “laced with lies.”

Peskov on Tuesday again accused the U.S. of “fomenting tensions” around Ukraine, a former Soviet state that has been locked in a conflict with Russia for almost eight years.

Western concern over Moscow planning an invasion of its neighbor started after tens of thousands of Russian troops massed near the Russia–Ukraine border. In 2014, Russia used its military forces to annex the Crimean Peninsula, a move that drew sanctions from then-President Barack Obama. The fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a peaceful settlement have stalled.",['Other'],['Other']

 The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) and the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) in Sri Lanka are holding an online meeting entitled “Oppose imperialist war!” on Thursday, May 23, at 7pm.

In announcing the recent International May Day Rally, David North, chairman of the International Editorial Board of the World Socialist Web Site, warned, “A third world war is not a distant possibility. The opening stages of this war are already underway.”

Israel’s genocide in Gaza against Palestinians and its US-backed attacks against Iran are just one front in a rapidly emerging world war involving nuclear armed powers. US imperialism and its allies are already engaged in a war against Russia in Ukraine and are making advanced preparations for a catastrophic conflict with China.

The imperialist leaders as well as various media pundits now casually refer to a nuclear war as an acceptable strategic option, despite the grave threat it poses to the existence of humanity.

The Biden administration, along with other NATO powers, have repeatedly crossed the “red lines” in Ukraine which they previously accepted as necessary to prevent nuclear war.

One might consider that the imperialist leaders—Biden, Sunak, Macron and Scholz—are criminally insane as they drag the planet towards nuclear conflagration. However, their policies are not simply the product of deranged individuals but of the profound crisis of world capitalism for which they have no rational, progressive solution and see a global war for domination as the only way out.

War is being accompanied by savage repression against any opposition as the terrible, continued persecution of Julian Assange for exposing the crimes of US imperialism graphically demonstrates.

Our comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk of the Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninists has been detained by the fascistic Zelensky government in Ukraine earlier this month on false accusations of being a Russian agent. Bogdan has courageously opposed the war in Ukraine, along with his comrades in Russia, denounced both the Ukrainian and Russian regimes and fought for the unity of the Ukrainian and Russian working class.

In the US and other imperialist countries, brutal police crackdowns are taking place against protesters opposing the Gaza genocide with thousands of arrests including of students.

The ongoing anti-war protests in universities and cities are significant, but on their own are incapable of halting the bloodbath. For seven months, the Zionist regime and its imperialist backers have not only ignored protests by millions around the world, but they are also turning to police repression.

The only social force capable of halting the drive to world war is the international working class which is coming into struggle in Sri Lanka and around the world in opposition to the austerity program of the ruling classes. As governments engage in, support and prepare for war, it is workers who are forced to bear the burden.

A struggle against war requires the building of a unified anti-war movement of the working class based on a socialist program, exposing the futility of protest politics and all the apologists for imperialism. Appeals to capitalist governments are bankrupt. The independent mobilisation of workers on this basis needs to take up the fight to free Assange and Syrotiuk as well.

The burning need is for a new revolutionary leadership in the working class based on socialist internationalism to abolish the source of militarism, austerity, authoritarianism and all sorts of social misery—the capitalist system.

The Minister of Education, Prof Tahir Mamman said this at the 2023/2024 Pre-departure briefing of Bilateral Education Agreement Scholars to Russia in Abuja on Tuesday. The first batch of students are already on their way to the airport for departure, while the second and third batches would depart on November 15 and November 17 respectively.

Represented by the Director of Universities Education in the ministry, Rakiya Ilyasu, Mamman advised the scholars not to see the opportunity as uncontrolled freedom to do things that would be to their disgrace.

He explained that the country had invested a lot in them and as such required the returns of investment on their return to the country.

“Note that you are few out of thousands who secured this opportunity which you must not take for granted. Your parents and teachers would also be happy with your succor.

“Your selection is part of a broader plan which ensures that brilliant Nigerians, especially those that cannot afford to study programmes that are not readily available in Nigeria, are supported to get necessary knowledge, skills and competence that would be useful in Nigeria’s development agenda.

“I am happy to inform you that in spite of the global economic meltdown, the number of our development partners have increased and many of them now offer scholarship to Nigeria.

“As you prepare to travel out, ensure to uphold and eschew good values, focus on your studies and be a good ambassador of your country,” he said.

The Minister also charged the scholars to always strive to abide by the laws of their host country and as well remember to be their brother’s keeper in their new environment.

“Most importantly, you need to make your presence known to the Nigerian Embassy in Moscow. This is very necessary based on our experiences from Ukraine.

“Your parents are also spending a lot of resources on you. Note that we all expert you return to our dear country at the end of your studies to assist Nigeria to become a better place by contributing your quota to its development, using your new knowledge and skills,” he added.

Also speaking, the Director, Federal Scholarship Board, Asta Ndajiwo said the journey began in November 2022 with applications from thousands of Nigerians which later translated to the nomination of the candidates. Ndajiwo commended the Federal Government efforts especially in the payment of the scholars allowances from September to December.

She also advised the scholars to do away with any extracurricular activities that could take their lives, recalling an incident with previous two scholars who lost their lives while swimming in a pool.

“We regret loosing two Nigerians scholars in Russia in the past that went to swim and in the process got drowned. We don’t want to loose anyone again and so we advise you stay away from water if you cannot swim.

“We want you to be your brother’s keeper, work hard and face your studies as you also be a good ambassador of the country.",['Other'],['Other']
5,EN_UA_022051.txt,"“A Declaration of War”: UK Plans To Put British Troops In Ukraine 

 by Mac Slavo, SHTF Plan:

Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned that if the United Kingdom signs an imminent deal with Ukraine to put troops in the country, Moscow would consider it as a declaration of war. Medvedev was reacting to the imminent signing of a security agreement between London and Kiev.

Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, issued his warning in a social media post.

A visit to Kiev on Friday by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is set to sign a security agreement with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, would ensure British troops would be openly deployed to Ukraine.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Sunak’s arrival in the Ukrainian capital is meant to “set out a major new package of support and reaffirm the close UK-Ukraine partnership,” his office said in a statement. The security document is a follow-up to agreements reached by G7 and NATO members last year, it noted. The statement did not mention any plans for a British military deployment in Ukraine, however, it could be implied.

“[The deal] formalizes a range of support the UK has been and will continue to provide for Ukraine’s security, including intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training, and defense industrial cooperation,” Downing Street said, according to a report by RT.

The British government has pledged £2.5 billion ($3.2 billion) in military aid to Ukraine over the next two years, including in the form of thousands of military drones, which London said will be the largest of their kind ever received by Kiev. Most of the UAVs will be made in the UK, the announcement added. –RT

Moscow has repeatedly accused the UK (and the United States) of helping Ukraine organize attacks against Russia, particularly in the Black Sea. The Russian Defense Ministry has claimed that British military personnel already have a presence in Ukraine.

 Putin Says West Prepared To Scapegoat Zelensky For War Failures: 'Replaced By Next Year'

Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam, where he signed at least a dozen energy and trade deals with the country's President To Lam, on his tour to shore up ties in Asia in an effort to offset the West's drive to isolate Moscow.

On his last day in the country he made some wide-ranging remarks to the press, and among the most interesting was a statement on the future of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Putin predicted at a moment things are going very badly for Ukrainian forces, and at a rare time Western media seems to be turning on Zelensky, that the Ukrainian leader will soon be replaced over his poor and unpopular decision-making. Putin suggested Washington is essentially going to make him a scapegoat.

""In the West, they simply do not want to replace him [Zelenskyy], the time is not right. I think it's obvious to anyone. They will blame all unpopular decisions on him, including lowering the [military] draft age, and that's it,"" Putin asserted, according to Russian media translation.

That's when he followed with: ""And then they'll replace him. I think it will happen sometime in the first half of next year.""

Putin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets, from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal. Indeed Zelensky's 'celebrity power' on display throughout the first part of the war, where it seemed he could simply do no wrong in the media's eyes, is waning fast.

More importantly, there are signs of large-scale dissent among the Ukrainian population as recruitment officers violently grab men from off the streets.

Despite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late, Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating. He has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power. Putin commented on this while in Vietnam:

Talks on Ukraine could take place as early as tomorrow, but Russia will use the current situation as a starting point, the president added.

""We have been conducting these behind-the-scenes talks, and what we hoped for has failed,"" Putin told reporters.

Zelensky's advisor, Alexey Arestovich, argued in 2019:— Glenn Diesen (@Glenn_Diesen) April 9, 2024

 Nato in talks to deploy more nuclear weapons amid the growing threat posed by Russia and China - as top Ukrainian security chief warns Putin could firebomb Kyiv with tactical nukes if facing a 'catastrophic defeat'

Nato might deploy more nuclear weapons amid an increasing threat posed by Russia and China, according to the head of the alliance.

Jens Stoltenberg, the 13th secretary general of Nato, revealed there were live discussions among members about removing missiles from storage and putting them on standby to act as a deterrent.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Stoltenberg said: 'I won't go into operational details about how many nuclear warheads should be operational and which should be stored, but we need to consult on these issues. That's exactly what we're doing.'

It comes as the head of Kyiv's national security council said Putin could demand a tactical nuclear weapon be used if Russia's army is beaten in Ukraine.

Oleksandr Lytvynenko made the comments after G7 leaders warned any use by Russia of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons would be met with 'severe consequences', The Times reported.

Meanwhile, Mr Stoltenberg warned in Brussels of the threat from China, adding that nuclear transparency should form the basis of Nato's nuclear strategy to prepare the alliance for the dangers of the world.

'Nato's aim is, of course, a world without nuclear weapons, but as long as nuclear weapons exist, we will remain a nuclear alliance, because a world where Russia, China and North Korea have nuclear weapons, and Nato does not, is a more dangerous world,' he said.

Mr Stoltenberg claimed that China is heavily investing in modern weaponry, which includes its nuclear arsenal, which the secretary general said would increase to 1,000 possibly by 2030.

He insisted the US and its European allies are modernising their nuclear deterrent as a result of heightened threat from Russia.

'The US is modernising their gravity bombs for the nuclear warheads they have in Europe and European allies are modernising the planes which are going to be dedicated to Nato's nuclear mission,' he said.

It comes as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday accused Russia of not wanting peace, after Putin said he would only accept a ceasefire if Ukraine agreed to halt its NATO ascension plans.

Zelensky made the accusation at the end of a major diplomatic summit in Switzerland, which more than 90 countries attended, making it the largest gathering in support of Ukraine since the start of the invasion.

The conference saw the vast majority of the 90 nations who attended sign a communique in support of Ukraine sovereignty, and also called for Putin to return children stolen during the invasion.","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support']"

 Former Vice President Mike Pence fired back on social media after an out-of-context video clip of him suggesting he’s more interested in the war in Ukraine than issues plaguing cities across the US went viral on Friday.

In the video, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson questions the 2024 Republican presidential candidate about where his priorities lie after Pence criticizes the length of time it has taken the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with weapons to fend off Russia’s invasion of the former Soviet state.

“You are distressed that the Ukrainians don’t have enough American tanks. Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years. Drive around. There’s not one city that’s gotten better in the United States, and it’s visible,” Carlson says during a forum at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa.

“Our economy has degraded, the suicide rate has jumped, public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased, and yet, your concern is that the Ukrainians – a country most people can’t find out a map – who’ve received tens of billions of US tax dollars don’t have enough tanks. I think it’s a fair question to ask, like, where’s the concern for the United States in that?” Carlson asks Pence.

To which Pence responds, “It’s not my concern. Tucker, I’ve heard that routine from you before, but that’s not my concern.”

Several conservatives on social media seized on the clip, including Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who shared a snippet of the exchange on Twitter and wrote, “Tucker Carlson just brutalized Mike Pence for prioritizing Ukraine despite a litany of social ills afflicting America.”

The former vice president shot back at Kirk on social media, sharing a clip with his full answer to Carlson that showed him explaining that under a Pence administration, the country would be able to tackle both issues affecting Ukraine and domestic problems at the same time.

“Sorry [Charlie Kirk]. That is what we used to call FAKE NEWS. Here’s the full clip of my remarks if you’re interested,” Pence wrote in his tweet.

In the extended clip, Pence continues his response to Carlson by saying, “Anybody that says that we can’t be the leader of the free world and solve our problems at home has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on Earth. We can do both.

“And as president of the United States, we will secure our border, we will support our military, we will revive our economy and stand by our values. And we will also lead the world for freedom under my administration. I promise you.”

Pence made an unannounced visit to Kyiv late last month and became the first declared 2024 Republican contender to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The 64-year-old made the trip with Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian humanitarian organization that the former vice president previously accompanied to Poland and Ukraine, a Pence adviser said.

“I really do believe that if Vladimir Putin and the Russian military were to overrun Ukraine, it wouldn’t be too long before they cross the border where our men and women would be required to fight,” Pence, an outspoken backer of the Ukrainian war effort and providing US military support for the country, told NBC News in June.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Overpraising the West', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene']"

 KREMLIN propagandists have called for London to be “turned to dust” after Ukraine said it would use British missiles.

The deranged ranting was part of a nightly show dedicated to pro-war discussion on state TV that’s hosted by a notorious Putin acolyte.

Last night’s show featured discussion of a report in The Sun saying Kyiv said it would use the Storm Shadow missile if the UK was willing to provide it.

At one point host Vladimir Solovyov bizarrely raised his hand as if to cast a spell, then stared manically at the camera and said: “London will turn to dust! To dust.”

Mad Vlad's mouthpiece, his face twisted with rage, then switches to English and begins shouting: “Burn in hell!” and “Flames!”

Solovyov was responding to a panellist who made a wildly exaggerated claim about a news story published by The Sun.

He fumed: “The British press is saying ‘We’ll give them hell! I’m quoting verbatim from their most popular paper The Sun.

“They all regard this as completely fine - ‘Russians can and need to be killed’. They’re saying that constantly.

“There’s one problem with Russians. They won’t give up as easily as that.”

The clip and its translation was tweeted by BBC Monitoring, which regularly posts on pro-Kremlin propaganda shows.

It comes after Volodymyr Zelensky asked for 600mph British missiles when he visited the UK recently with a shopping list of weapons.

It followed a warning from Zelensky that longer-range weapons from western allies would allow Ukraine to take the battle to areas occupied by Russian.

""It will allow us to make the evil completely retreat from our country by destroying its airbases deep in the occupied territories,” he said during his visit.

In response, Rishi Sunak said “nothing is off the table” when it comes to military support for Ukraine.

The Government is still weighing up whether to send deadly Harpoon anti-ship missiles or surface-to-air Storm Shadows to arm Ukrainian defenders.

After Germany finally agree to send tanks, Solovyov, and other Kremlin propagandists threatened nuclear strikes on the West.

In a similar rant he claimed it meant Germany had joined the war.

Solovyov said: ""It’s time to send a clear, resolute message that we now consider Germany a direct party to the conflict, rekindling memories of World War Two.

“German tanks appearing [in Ukraine] will definitely mean we consider German territory, military bases and other sites as legitimate targets.”

Raging Moscow TV pundit Yevgeny Satanovsky said warheads should be launched on the German capital Berlin and the country’s parliament, the Bundestag.

“Flat, slightly radioactive, melted-down ground [will remain in its place].”

Ukrainian defenders are bracing for an assault that could include 1,800 tanks, 3,950 armoured vehicles, 400 fighter jets and 300 helicopters incoming from Russia.

 Israel to respond to genocide charges at UN’s top court

Israel will respond to charges of genocide at the United Nations’ top court on Friday after South Africa filed an urgent request with the court to order a ceasefire in Gaza.

It is the third time the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has held hearings on the Israel-Hamas war since South Africa filed proceedings at The Hague court in December.

On Thursday, South Africa told the court the situation in Gaza has reached “a new and horrific stage”, and urged the 15 judges to take urgent action.

Israel must “totally and unconditionally withdraw” from the Gaza Strip, said Vusimuzi Madonsela, South Africa’s ambassador to the Netherlands.

South Africa has submitted four requests for the ICJ to investigate Israel. According to the latest request, the country says Israel’s military incursion in Rafah threatens the “very survival of Palestinians in Gaza”.

During hearings earlier this year, Israel strongly denied committing genocide in Gaza, saying it does all it can to spare civilians and is only targeting Hamas militants. Israel says Rafah is the last stronghold of the militant group.

In January, judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.

The court has already found that there is a “real and imminent risk” to the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israel’s military operations.

“This may well be the last chance for the court to act,” said Irish lawyer Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, who is part of South Africa’s legal team.

ICJ judges have broad powers to order a ceasefire and other measures, though the court does not have its own enforcement apparatus.

A 2022 order by the court demanding that Russia halt its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has so far gone unheeded.

Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced since fighting began.

The war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 in which Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.

Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in its count.

South Africa initiated proceedings in December 2023 and sees the legal campaign as rooted in issues central to its identity. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Blacks to “homelands”. Apartheid ended in 1994.

On Sunday, Egypt announced it plans to join the case. Several countries have also indicated they plan to intervene, but only Libya, Nicaragua and Colombia have filed formal requests to do so.

The hypocritical ICC didn’t bother to contrast and compare Putin’s supposed abduction of Ukrainian children to an organized mass kidnapping of Vietnamese children. It was dubbed “Operation Babylift,” ordered by then President Ford, and was conducted at the end of the Vietnam War as the USG evacuated, having lost the war.

The Vietnamese children abducted without permission were described as “orphans,” although many had parents and relatives that were left behind. 3,300 children, described as “infants” (many were older children), were parceled out to families in America, Australia, West Germany, and France.

The “rescue” of these children was an organized act of kidnapping pure and simple, yet in the Land of Amnesia, millions of Americans know nothing about it (or, for that matter, the Vietnam War itself and the brutal destruction of Southeast Asia).

In 1975, a class action suit was filed in San Francisco on behalf of the kidnapped children.

“The suit seeks to enjoin adoption proceedings until it has been ascertained either that the parents or appropriate relatives in Vietnam have consented to their adoption or that these parents or relatives cannot be found,” The Adoption History Project notes. “The Complaint alleged that several of the Vietnamese orphans brought to the United States under Operation Babylift stated they are not orphans and that they wish to return to Vietnam.”

A statement issued on April 4, 1975, by “professors of ethics and religion,” pointed out that many “of the children are not orphans; their parents or relatives may still be alive, although displaced, in Vietnam… The Vietnamese children should be allowed to stay in Vietnam where they belong.”

The operation was celebrated by the corporate media and “Hollywood’s celebrity elite… [and, as a propaganda event] generated a spectacle of celebration and emphasized that the babies were more than just average orphans,” writes US History Scene.

Uncritical acceptance of the Vietnam war orphans did not last long. A variety of American voices that ranged from child psychologists to news reporters to the casual observer soon began asking whether the evacuation served the best interests of the children. This concern followed closely on the heels of criticism over U.S. motivation for the evacuation. Much of this controversy began when the unclear orphan status of some of the children came to light. The government of South Vietnam reluctantly allowed so many children to leave the country only under the condition that those who left would already be in the adoption process. Volunteers processing the children found that not all of them fit into this category of orphan. In the processing centers, some of the children told the volunteers that they were not orphans and had families living back in Vietnam.

Naturally, Operation Babylift is all but forgotten today. It would be counterproductive to the onslaught of USG and ICC propaganda, not directed at the welfare of children, but rather as a crude “informational” device to further turn opinion against Russia’s SMO to denazify and disarm Ukraine and, in addition, prevent NATO from undermining Russian national security.

 Paranoid Putin tries to hide ‘cancer battle’ by making bombshell medical files SECRET as weak ruler fears being toppled’

PANICKED Vladimir Putin has dramatically classified bombshell data which appears to prove he has been treated for cancer.

Rumours have persistently swirled that the tyrant, 70, is ""critically ill"" - fuelled by his bloated face and trembling legs.

Bombshell spy documents leaked to The Sun appeared to confirm Putin has pancreatic cancer and early-stage Parkinson's disease.

Now the panicked Russian leader has desperately classified medical files that reveal an apparent cancer battle as he fears a coup inside the Kremlin.

A loophole previously allowed investigative journalists to show that the dictator was constantly accompanied by a top thyroid cancer specialist and other medics.

Revelations last April indicated surgeon Yevgeny Selivanov, of Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital, had flown to Putin no less than 35 times in Black Sea resort Sochi.

More on Putin

The proof of Putin’s treatment by cancer doctors was deduced from the existence of contracts with the hospital which were listed on a Russian public procurement website.

Now such details have been made top secret, preventing public knowledge of current and future contracts.

Earlier it was seen that Putin was accompanied by between six and 13 medical specialists on his trips.

Medics were also seen to be on standby near his favourite official residences outside Moscow, for example in Sochi and Valdai.

Most read in The Sun

The report by Proekt media in April gave credence to rumours that Putin had suffered from cancer.

Medics appeared to be thyroid and ENT specialists.

It comes after it was revealed the Russian government has built a secret network of rail lines that lead to Putin's residences - and train stations nearby.

The blocking of data of such contracts was revealed by Sirena, part of Radio Liberty.

KREMLIN COUP?

The move is likely to increase speculation that the Kremlin is hiding the truth about Putin’s health during the war against Ukraine.

Symptoms of thyroid cancer include the appearance of a thick nodule in the thyroid area; hoarseness of voice; difficulty swallowing; pain in the neck and throat; enlarged lymph nodes in the neck; a dry cough, scratchy or scratchy feeling in the throat or behind the sternum.

There have also been claims that Putin is suffering from abdominal cancer and other ailments.

Meanwhile, there have been suggestions that drugs to treat his cancer may have distorted his mind when he launched the war in Ukraine.

The Kremlin insists that Putin is healthy.

Among the medics named as treating Putin were Dr Dmitry Verbovoy, an expert in acute illnesses, injuries and poisonings.

Another was Dr Konstantin Sim, an orthopaedic traumatologist, possibly helping with ice hockey injuries, ENT doctor Alexei Shcheglov and infectious disease specialist Yaroslav Protasenko.

He was also seen by neurosurgeons from the Central Clinical Hospital, led by department head Oleg Myshkin and Dr Elena Rastrusina, plus a resuscitator

Dr Pavel Sharikov, and head nurse Lyudmila Kadenkova.

A rehabilitation specialist was also involved, Dr Mikhail Tsykunov.In July 2020, Putin met with the head of the National Medical Research Center for Endocrinology, Ivan Dedov.

It comes after the former head of MI6 suggested said there could be a coup inside the Kremlin to oust Putin - but the mechanisms for political change in Russia are ""fragile"".

Sir Richard Dearlove told The Sun: ""I think we're heading into another phase where you're going to get a political upheaval as a result of a war gone badly wrong.

 Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has promised he is ""ready to fight"" following reports of multiple Ukrainian mayors being kidnapped by the invading Russian military.

Ukraine has accused Russian forces of capturing mayors in Dniprorudne and Melitopol in recent days, sparking concerns that additional mayors could be kidnapped next, including the mayor of the country's capital city.

Klitschko, who was a highly regarded world heavyweight boxing champion before entering politics, insisted during a Fox News interview on Monday that any Russian soldiers who hope to capture him would find that their task was ""not easy.""

""I am ready to fight,"" Klitschko said after America Reports host John Roberts asked him about a potential kidnapping attempt. ""This will be not easy to do that ... nobody feels safety in our country right now in this very difficult situation. Everyone [is] ready to fight, ready to defend our city.""

""I am not worried about kidnap,"" he added. ""I am ready to fight, that's why I have weapons, that's why it's my hometown and I want to defend the interest of my citizens, the interest of my home, the interest of my family.""

Ukrainian officials announced the kidnapping of Dniprorudne Mayor Matveev Sergeevich on Sunday, while they said that Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov was captured two days earlier. Russia went on to appoint a Moscow-friendly mayor in Melitopol.

While commenting on the kidnapping of Fedorov, which was partially captured on video, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserted that ""the actions of Russian invaders will be equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists.""

Klitschko suggested that the kidnappings were part of a pattern of ""un-human"" Russian troops choosing to ignore the international rules of war, noting that mayors are civilian targets.

""War also has rules,"" said Klitschko. ""But Russians [don't] want the rules ... what they want is the symbol ... they can't break the mood of the people and that's why they kidnap the mayors.""

""Its actually against all rules,"" Klitschko continued. ""We see how unfriendly, how un-human activity make Russians in our land.""

Following Russian bombing campaigns on Monday, the Kyiv mayor surveyed scenes of damage in the city alongside his brother Wladimir Klitschko, who is also a former world heavyweight boxing champion.

""That's what Russia's war against the civilians looks like,"" Wladimir Klitschko said while standing in the rubble in a video uploaded to Twitter. ""Destroyed buildings, destroyed infrastructure. [A] city bus just got hit by a rocket. Lives are getting lost, that's the war that Russia started.""

According to the Ukrainian government, Monday's Russian strikes on Kyiv also included a missile hitting a nine-story residential building, leaving two dead and three others hospitalized.

Newsweek reached out to the Embassy of Russia in Washington, D.C., for comment.

 Putin’s masses of HIV-positive prisoners choosing to go to meat-grinder frontline rather than rot in jail with no meds

RUSSIAN prisoners who have tested positive for HIV are choosing to be sent to the frontline hoping to get lifesaving medication.

A large number of Vladimir Putin's HIV-positive prisoner recruits deemed they preferred the battlefield rather than rot in jail where they were denied treatment.

The Wagner Group has been mass-recruiting inmates from Russia's infamous prisons, offering them a pardon if they survive for six months.

Ukrainian officials estimate about 20 per cent of recruits in Russian prisoner units are HIV positive.

And a lot of them were so desperate for the anti-viral medications they couldn't get in jail, they opted to join Putin's bloody war in Ukraine, the New York Times reported.

Speaking from a detention centre in Dnipro, an HIV-positive Russian soldier named Timur, 37, told the newspaper: ""Conditions were very harsh.""

He said how doctors in prison changed the anti-viral medication to a different type that he suspected was not effective.

Fearing he was not going to last his ten-year sentence behind bars, agreed to join Putin's bloodthirsty Wagner Group for six months in exchange for a pardon and supplies of anti-viral medications.

Speaking about the dilemma of poor treatment in prison or fight in Ukraine, he said: ""I understood I would have a quick death or a slow death. I chose a quick death.""

Timur, who had no military experience said he had two weeks of training before being deployed to Bakhmut- where one of the bloodiest battles of the war happened.

Most read in The Sun

He said that the unit's commanders ""repeated many times, ‘if you try to leave this field, we will shoot you.’""

While he was captured, he said that most of the soldiers were killed on their first day.

Another soldier named Ruslan, 42, said he welcomed Wagner's acceptance of HIV-positive inmates and joined the frontline for a chance at medication and freedom.

He said: ""If you have a long sentence, it gives you a chance to begin life again.""

New conscripts in Putin's private army were forced to wear coloured-coded wristbands to signify they had serious infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's Ministry of Defence claimed that Russia marks these ""sick 'fighters' with appropriate bracelets on their hands"".

""In order to 'mark' infected militants, the command of 'Wagners' forces them to wear red bracelets on the arm in case of HIV, and white bracelets in case of hepatitis,"" the Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence said in a statement.

The report suggested that Russian conscripts were furious about having to serve alongside ""infected"" militants and military doctors regularly refused to provide assistance to the infected soldiers if they got wounded on the battlefield.

Another HIV prisoner Yevgeny who suffered a gunshot wound before he was captured, said that although he did receive treatment, he felt medics were careless about infecting other patients around him.

He said: ""There were no conditions for the HIV infected.

""We were all treated together, the healthy and the unhealthy.""

 Fetterman drapes himself in Israeli flag during DC rally in support of the Jewish state

Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) draped himself in an Israel flag as he joined the nearly 300,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, DC, Tuesday in support of the Jewish state as it wages war against Hamas terrorists.

The Pennsylvania Democrat was photographed at the March for Israel rally with the blue and white flag wrapped over his trademark hoodie as he greeted attendees.

Fetterman has been unequivocal in his staunch support of Israel since Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack despite facing some left-wing backlash over his stance.

“Of course I’m here, how could I not!” Fetterman told one rally-goer, according to an attendee’s X post.

A sharp-eyed X user pointed out that Fetterman used the strings on his hoodie to affix the flag to himself in “the most bipartisan act I’ve ever seen from a Senator.”

Fetterman’s fondness for the Israeli flag triggered several pro-Palestinian protesters outside the US Capitol last week, after the senator emerged from the building waving a small Star of David flag above his head as some demonstrators were being arrested.

“Shame! What a joke!” some of the booing protesters shouted as Fetterman strolled by.

In his office, the senator also displays the posters of the innocent Israelis kidnapped by Hamas terrorists during their deadly raid which also killed 1,200 people.

“They will stay up until every single person is safely returned home,” Fetterman noted in a video posted on X.

Fetterman has also argued against a cease-fire in the conflict, which has reportedly angered some of his supporters and former staffers.

“Now is not the time to talk about a ceasefire. We must support Israel in efforts to eliminate the Hamas terrorists who slaughtered innocent men, women, and children,” the former lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania said in anOct. 18 post on X. “Hamas does not want peace, they want to destroy Israel. We can talk about a ceasefire after Hamas is neutralized.”

Fetterman, however, has remained a harsh critic of congressional Republican efforts to decouple US military aid for Israel from a separate aid proposal for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion.

On Tuesday he called on his GOP colleagues in the upper chamber to cease efforts to pass a stand-alone Israel aid bill.

“Israel and Ukraine are going through existential threats. We need to send aid to BOTH, and my Republican colleagues need to cut the crap,” Fetterman wrote on X.

“This is totally unacceptable. The European Union is not in favor of war. The European Union is not on the side of war,” Borrell said, adding that the EU is supporting Ukraine in its war against aggression by Russia and wants to end the war in accordance with the UN Charter.

Borrell also said the “unacceptable approach” of the Hungarian government regarding Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s visit to Moscow and Kyiv would be discussed at a separate meeting on Monday.

Borrell noted that member states should be looking at how investment and funding could help Ukraine, such as by restoring its damaged electricity infrastructure as soon as possible and providing additional air defense systems.

“These are the two most important things right now,” he stressed.

Borrell also commented on the opinion issued by the UN International Court of Justice (ICJ), which was delivered on Friday, according to which Israel’s settlement policy and use of natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territories violate international law and Israel must pay reparations to the Palestinians for the damage caused by the occupation.

He said that these conclusions were largely in line with the EU position, which he said was fully consistent with UN resolutions on the status of the occupied Palestinian territories.

 Ukrainians show strength at Deaflympics in Brazil

Caxias do Sul (Brazil) (AFP) – When Rymma Filimoshkina practiced the hammer throw in the yard near her house in Mariupol at the start of the Ukraine war, her neighbors thought she was throwing a bomb.

Issued on:

But her ""weapon"" isn't one of destruction: it just won the 33-year-old deaf athlete a gold medal at the Deaflympics in Brazil.

Thousands of kilometers (miles) from the conflict at home, the Ukrainian team is raking in the medals at the Olympics for the deaf, which opened on May 1 and wrap up Sunday in the southern city of Caxias do Sul.

With two days left to go in the Games, Ukraine had a commanding lead in the medal table, with a total of 116 -- more than double the second-place United States.

""In this event, we show the world we exist: we are Ukraine, a real powerful, independent and democratic country,"" said Valeriy Sushkevych, president of the Ukraine Paralympic committee.

""One soldier called us and said: in between battles, we support you on TV. Your fighting spirit in sports is very important for us,"" he told AFP.

'Really want' peace

Ukraine has a history of punching above its weight in disabled sport.

Its Paralympic program owes its success to two and a half decades of specialized schools in every region of the country for children with disabilities, who start participating in sporting programs at an early age, Sushkevych says.

Ukraine finished sixth in the medal table at the Summer Paralympics in Tokyo last year, and second at the Winter Paralympics in Beijing in March, just after Russia launched its invasion.

The team's success at the Deaflympics is symbolically charged: Ukraine had finished second in the medal table at the last three editions of the event -- behind Russia, which was banned from all international competitions over the invasion.

""I dedicate these medals to Ukraine. I'm very proud to represent my country,"" said a smiling Dmytro Levin, a 24-year-old native of Kharkiv, speaking in sign language after winning two golds and a bronze in orienteering.

""I'm happy to have won this medal for Ukraine. But all I really want is peace,"" said 15-year-old Sofia Chernomorova, who won bronze in badminton.

'Didn't hear the sirens'

Filimoshkina said she still remembers the vibrations she felt with every bomb that exploded in Mariupol, the port city devastated by relentless Russian strikes.

""A lot of deaf people died because they didn't hear the air raid sirens and went outside at the wrong time,"" she said.

Her teammate Julia Kysylova, who won silver in the hammer throw, said that for a long time, she was sure they would have to cancel their trip for the Games.

""When the war erupted, it was impossible to train. I spent a month sheltering at home,"" said the 25-year-old athlete from Nova Kakhovka, in the hard-hit southern region of Kherson.

She finally managed to flee to Spain, leaving her husband behind.

""It was a miracle we managed to cross the border. The trip took more than two days,"" she said.

""After the Games, I hope to go back home and be with my husband,"" she added.

""But I don't know if that will be possible.""

The Truth About the JFK Assassination, the 9/11 Attacks, and the Holocaust

Back in 1959 Vice President Richard Nixon visited Moscow and held his famous “Kitchen debate” with Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev. Nixon favorably compared the standard of living of American suburbanites to that of their Russian counterparts under Communism.

Criticizing Soviet society was a serious crime in those days, but I doubt that the Russians ever considered arresting Nixon and giving him a ten year stretch in the gulag for “anti-Soviet agitation.” Not even Maoist China at the height of its Cultural Revolution would have considered such a thing.

But late last week, on the eve of a Russia-China leadership summit in Moscow, Europe’s International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the man who controls the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, whose striking power is further enhanced by its revolutionary hypersonic delivery systems.

The charges against Putin were that he had ordered the humanitarian evacuation of children from the dangerous Ukraine warzone, and the ICC also ordered the arrest of Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights.

Yet oddly enough, no ICC action had ever been taken against American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had famously declared in 1996 that the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children brought about by the American economic sanctions she supported was “worth it.”

Indeed, in 2016 National Security Advisor John Bolton leveled harsh threats against ICC judges if they dared take legal action against any Americans accused of torture and murder, and many have noticed the strange lack of ICC even-handedness over the years.

But issuing a press release or even an arrest warrant does not necessarily determine events in real life, and the Moscow summit between Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has hardly been disturbed. Taken together, Russia and China control a substantial fraction of the world’s natural resources and industrial capacity, and although their global propaganda presence is weak, those former factors are more important as elements of real world power.

As an example of this, last week Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of the most important Middle Eastern countries, announced in Beijing that after negotiations held under Chinese auspices they had reestablished diplomatic relations despite many years of bitter hostility:

Using duplicity, deception and secret alliances, the U.K.’s inner circle of top elites led by Nathaniel Rothschild, King Edward VII, and Lord Alfred Milner backed the German Kaiser into a corner and intentionally set the Germans up to blame them for starting the First World War, when in fact it was the British who provoked the Germans to the point where war was the only option.

German generals were caught strategizing several weeks ago on how to bomb Russia’s main bridge to Crimea. This would be an act of aggression that Russian President Vladimir Putin described as guaranteed to draw a harsh military response from Russia, possibly even including a nuclear strike against Berlin.

And that has led to an admission by German officials that their military is woefully unprepared to take on Russia. If German generals and politicians truly want to provoke a war with Russia, they had better slow down and wait for their military to catch up to the political rhetoric coming out of Berlin.

A March 14 article by John Cody at Remix News shows that the German Army lacks the personnel, equipment and infrastructure to wage a major war of any kind, let alone with a nuclear-armed military superpower like Russia.

“Germany’s own military and government are painting such a dire picture of the armed forces that there are now calls from some of the most powerful politicians in the country to reinstate mandatory military service,” Cody writes.

She finds it “really impressive” that Germany has emptied out its military defense stocks by handing it over to Ukraine to be wasted in a losing war with Russia. That sounds like an admission of treason in the wide open.

But wait. There’s more.

Germany knows it is incapable of taking on Russia so it is negotiating a secret deal with the insane leaders of two other European countries, France and Poland, for the very purpose of sending troops into Ukraine separate from NATO, although I do not believe this could truly be done without the acquiescence of Washington and London.

An organization called the Weimar Triangle – composed of France, Germany and Poland – has been in existence since 1991 at the fall of the Soviet Union.

The stated purpose of the Weimar Triangle was to assist Poland’s emergence from Communist rule. It’s strange that it still exists but it may have found a new purpose – instigating World War III with Russia.

According to Wikipedia, “the Weimar Triangle exists mostly in the form of summit meetings between the leaders of the three countries and of their foreign ministers.

 Russia threatens nukes for US, UK, Finland if NATO expands

Vladimir Putin warned the president of Finland Saturday that any effort to join NATO would “negatively” affect relations between the two countries.

The comments followed another Russian leader’s threat to use the Satan-2 hypersonic nuclear missile to strike Britain and Finland “in just 200 seconds” — and that the weapons could be used to hit the United States as well.

As NATO foreign ministers gathered in Berlin, with discussion about potential applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western military alliance on the agenda, Putin spoke to Finnish leader Sauli Niinisto.

Nijnisto told Putin in the phone conversation that the traditionally non-aligned country “will decide to apply for NATO membership in the coming days.”

Finland and Sweden, also traditionally neutral, are moving toward the applications in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.

Putin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”

Niinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

The exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.

“If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate — to question the existence of this state. This is logical,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. “The Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.”

“If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,” he continued. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA. Well, get in line.”

The Satan-2 is a ballistic missile capable of carrying 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each.

Russia wouldn’t need to move nukes to its European border to carry out its threat, officials boasted.

“We can hit with a Sarmat [known in the West as Satan-2] from Siberia, and even reach the UK,” he said. “And if we strike from Kaliningrad … the hypersonic’s reaching time is 200 seconds – so go ahead, guys.

“On the Finnish border we will have not strategic weapons, but Kinzhal-class, one that will reach Finland in 20 seconds, or even 10 seconds.”

Zelensky wishes to express support for Israel, but due to his own constraints - as Ukraine has been under attack from Russia for nearly two years - he cannot make it to Israel on a ""standalone trip"" and is expected to include Israel as part of a future European tour.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian police, spanning its many units including the special forces, crafted a heartfelt tribute to the State of Israel through a video featuring officers from across their ranks.

""The year is 2023. Israel was brutally attacked by terrorists. During the attack, hundreds of civilians, military personnel, including police officers were killed,” members of the Patrol Police of Ukraine say in the video.

“Patrol officers express their deepest respect and gratitude to police and military officers of Israel. To those who were the first to join the battle and became the adamant defenders of their citizens.

“We are deeply saddened by the deaths and losses that Israel has suffered as a result of this brutal aggression. The Patrol Police of Ukraine stands side by side with Israel at this important moment. And we express our most sincere solidarity to all police and military families of Israel. May our mutual friendship and support help Israel to overcome these turbulent times and return to peace and security.”

Blogger Ilya Sokolov said that he has been receiving numerous inquiries from non-Jewish friends in Ukraine who are interested in going to Israel to fight Hamas. ""The solidarity with Israel is overwhelming,"" he said.",['Other'],['Other']

 The Eurocrats Fear That Fico's Attempted Assassination Will Influence Next Month's Elections

Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned last week that Russia will ramp up its meddling ahead of next month’s parliamentary elections, which preceded European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova assessing that they’d be a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience. This speculation is nothing new, but what’s different this time around is that the attempted assassination of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be on every voter’s mind, thus likely influencing the outcome.

The preceding hyperlinked analysis argued that fake news was responsible for radicalizing the pro-Ukrainian suspect into thinking that shooting his premier was a legitimate form of protest against what he’d been misled by the media into believing was his “pro-Russian dictator with blood on his hands”. This black swan event might have served the short-term interests of that leader’s many enemies, but the blowback could be considerable if it leads to a conservative landslide during next month’s elections.

Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban predicted that the upcoming vote will influence the direction of war and peace in Europe, and while the European Parliament admittedly can’t do much in terms of shaping the NATO-Russian proxy war in Ukraine, it could still exert positive pressure if conservatives win. It’s with that in mind that Eurocrats like von der Leyen and Jourova are fearmongering about Russian meddling since they want to preemptively discredit this potential outcome.

To be sure, the first of those two had no idea that an assassination attempt would be made against Fico the day after she shared her earlier mentioned warning, but the second’s assessment about the upcoming elections being a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience came some days later. Instead of speaking vaguely about alleged Russian meddling, the Eurocrats are now honing their information warfare narrative to muddle the conversation about Fico’s attempted assassination and its political aftermath.

The targeted audience is the unclear number of on-the-fence voters who might usually lean liberal but have recently begun to sympathize with some conservative positions on issues like Ukraine. Last week’s incident was driven by the liberal media’s fake news about the Slovak leader, which might influence some of these voters to give the more narratively responsible conservatives their support. In an attempt to desperately prevent this, the Eurocrats want them think that it would be doing Russia’s bidding.

If the European Parliamentary elections have absolutely no effect on anything, then they wouldn’t care who votes for whom, but the outcome will clearly at the very least have a major impact on popular perceptions and could lead to cascading consequences like more anti-war protests across the bloc. It’s for this reason that the Eurocrats and their media allies, including those being promoted by state-run Ukrainian outlets like this one here, are pushing the abovementioned information warfare narrative.

The growing gap between liberals and conservatives over Ukraine, which is foreign policy issue that Fico was most closely associated with, is naturally occurring as a result of their polar opposite worldviews and not due to Russian meddling. It’s so emotive and significant that some from both sides have become single-issue voters who’ll cast their ballots purely based on candidates’ positions towards this. Attempting to discredit this trend as being due to Russian meddling is disrespectful to democracy.","['URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Distrust towards Media']","['URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Ukrainian media cannot be trusted']"
23,EN_UA_017310.txt,"Jake Sullivan hints US won’t replenish controversial cluster munitions to Ukraine 

 The Biden administration has no plans to replenish the stockpile of controversial cluster bombs it’s sending to Ukraine, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.

“Our current plan is not to replenish that stockpile,” Sullivan told NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” .

“It is rather to build up the capacity to produce the unitary round of the 155, the non-cluster munition round of ammunition,” he said.

Earlier this month, President Biden opted to send the divisive ammunition to Ukraine — and publicly acknowledged he was prompted to do so because the military is running low on 155 mm artillery ammunition rounds.

A chorus of critics — both abroad and at home — decried the decision, citing the grave dangers cluster munitions pose to civilians given their dud rates.

Sullivan echoed Biden’s defense — that the US must supply Ukraine with adequate firepower.

“We began that process months ago was we anticipated the need for continuing supply Ukraine, but it takes time and that is why we need a bridge from today,” he said, referencing steps to boost production of 155 mm rounds.

“We need to ensure that Ukraine has the necessary supply of ammunition to a few months down the road, when we believe we can supply enough of the unitary round to meet Ukraine’s defense needs.”

Cluster bombs are prohibited by over 100 countries across the world, including multiple NATO members.

Military officials claim the cluster bombs being sent to Ukraine have a dud rate of around 2.35% or less — markedly lower than the roughly 30% and 40% dud rate estimated for Russia’s cluster munitions being deployed against Ukraine.

The dud rate refers to the likelihood of the bomblets in the cluster munitions not exploding after being deployed.

Bomblets that are duds may detonate long after being deployed.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin previously committed to having the US help Ukraine scour and clean up duds from those munitions.

Sullivan insisted dissemination of the controversial bombs doesn’t undercut US’ “moral authority.”

“Our moral authority and Ukraine’s moral authority in this conflict comes from the fact that we are supporting a country under brutal, vicious attack by its neighbor with missiles and bombs raining down in its cities, killing its civilians, destroying its schools, it’s churches, its hospitals,” he said.

“The idea that providing Ukraine with a weapon in order for them to be able to defend their homeland, protect their civilians is somehow a challenge for moral authority I find questionable,” he added.

Last week, NATO held a summit in Vilinius, lithuania, and ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit there, he slammed NATO allies for their position on admitting the war-torn nation into the powerful alliance.

Sullivan reiterated the US position that Ukraine can receive admittance once it wraps up the necessary reforms to meet the alliance’s democracy requirements.

“We could have said it more clearly,” Sullivan said, alluding to a NATO communique. “Ukraine’s future will be in NATO. Period full stop. That was a single, clear sentence.

 Molotov Cocktail Attack On Russian Embassy In Moldova On Last Day Of Election

Sunday is the final day of three days of presidential elections in Russia. Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of deceased opposition activist Alexei Navalny, is urging mass protests against President Putin as he stands of the verge of winning another six year term as president, an outcome quite obvious to all observers. She's calling on Russians to disrupt the final day of voting in what's been dubbed ""noon against Putin"".

While some sporadic minor incidents at polling stations have been reported, there has been a major incident in the small country of Moldova which borders Ukraine. Moldovan police have detained a man who attacked the Russian embassy with two Molotov cocktails as voting was underway there.

""A man threw two containers of flammable substances over the fence of the Russian Embassy in Chisinau,"" police said in a statement. A 54-year-old Moldovan who described himself as also having Russian citizenship was immediately detained after after hurling the Molotov cocktails.

There were no reports of injuries or damage to the embassy, and police said an investigation is ongoing. ""He justified his action by some dissatisfaction he has with the actions of the Russian authorities,"" authorities said.

Moldova has been scene of controversy and friction especially after Russia allowed the opening of several polling stations in breakaway Transnistria, which the Moldovan government has fiercely protested.

Reuters noted days ago that ""A senior official in ex-Soviet Moldova said on Wednesday Moscow was breaking laws by printing ballot papers in the separatist region of Transnistria ahead of this week's Russian presidential election.""

""Moldova's pro-European authorities have already summoned the Russian ambassador to complain about a decision to open six polling stations in the pro-Russian enclave,"" the report continued. ""The central government said the move broke an agreement to allow voting only at a single polling station at the Russian embassy in Chisinau.""

The United States recently become more vocal in defending Moldova's territorial integrity, and has condemned what the Biden administration has called Moscow's 'interference' in the Eastern European nation's sovereignty.

Last summer, Moldova expelled 45 Russian diplomats and embassy staff members from the country ""over numerous unfriendly actions"" as tensions reached near breaking point over the war in neighboring Ukraine and the Transnistria issue. As for Russia's election, Kremlin authorities have said Ukraine is engaged in cross-border attacks on polling stations and in annexed regions of Ukraine.",['Other'],['Other']
25,EN_UA_015880.txt,"Wagner to leave Bakhmut by June 1, transfer control to Russian army Bakhmut was previously known as Artemovsk to honour a Soviet revolutionary before Ukraine renamed iy 

 The Wagner mercenary group’s head Yevgeny Prigozhin has announced that he will withdraw his troops from Bakhmut by next month and transfer control to the Russian army. The announcement comes just two days after he claimed that the troops have successfully captured the key Ukrainian city.

The claims were however refuted by Kyiv who said that it is hanging on to a corner of the eastern Ukrainian city and that battles are ongoing.

“Wagner will leave Artemovsk from May 25 to June 1,” Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin said in an audio recording on Telegram.

Bakhmut was previously known as Artemovsk to honour a Soviet revolutionary before Ukraine renamed it.

Before planning the transfer of control, Prigozhin readied troops on the western outskirts of the city.

He said, “If the ministry of defence does not have enough personnel, we have thousands of generals.”

Prigozhin has poured scathing criticism on Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and army chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, accusing them of being incompetent and causing Moscow’s large-scale losses in the conflict in Ukraine.

Wagner fighters have spearheaded Russia’s storming of Bakhmut and Prigozhin’s influence has risen hugely during Moscow’s Ukraine offensive.

The Russian military claimed on Saturday that it has successfully captured the much-contested eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.

The Wagner Group led the all-out offensive in the city. Earlier in the day, Prigozhin said that his troops had finally pushed the Ukrainians out of the last built-up area inside the city.

The Russian defence ministry said in a statement, “As a result of offensive actions by Wagner assault units, supported by artillery and aviation of the Southern Group of Forces, the liberation of Artyomovsk has been completed.”

“Vladimir Putin congratulated the assault units of Wagner as well as all servicemen of units of the Russian armed forces who provided them with the necessary support and flank cover, on the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk (the Soviet-era name for Bakhmut),” TASS agency quoted the Kremlin saying.

26,EN_UA_021270.txt,"Ukraine's Fate Will Be Decided In Coming Year, Top Zelensky Aide Admits 

 Ukraine's Fate Will Be Decided In Coming Year, Top Zelensky Aide Admits

In surprisingly blunt words, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the coming year will essentially decide the fate of Ukraine and its war with Russia.

""A turning point in the war is approaching,"" Andrii Yermak, who serves as chief of staff for the Office of the President of Ukraine, said Monday. ""The next year will be decisive in this regard."" He issued the words while appealing for more urgent aid from Washington in an address to the hawkish DC-based Hudson Institute think tank.

Yermak sought to assure the audience that Zelensky has ""a clear plan"" forward even as Western media has by and large soured on Kiev's prospects for success. Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.

He described advancing plans for ""the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.""

But he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more ""weapons right now""--describing that ""Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.""

Without doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as ""the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.""

So now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the ""bad news"" of late out of Ukraine.

Yermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be ""charity"" but is instead an ""investment"" in America's ""global leadership.""

He further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. ""We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,"" Yermak said.

 Putin may ABANDON siege of Kyiv and try to blitz other cities into submission after losing thousands of troops

MAD Vlad Putin may abandon plans to capture Kyiv as countless Russian soldiers would be killed, spooks now believe.

Spies say the death toll of an all-out assault on Ukraine's capital may even be too much for the evil Kremlin tyrant to stomach.

A Western official said: ""An ill-judged ground assault on a city as well prepared as Kyiv, with really determined and committed defenders, would be a fairly costly business.

""And I think there comes a point where even Russia has to count the cost of casualties.

They said Putin's forces were getting ""bogged down"" around the outskirts of Kyiv after suffering ambushes by heroic Ukrainians.

As many as 7,000 Russian troops have been killed in the bloody fighting so far as Putin's battleplan continues to fall apart.

Spies fear the crazed despot could resort to even more brutal firepower that could blow entire cities to smithereens.

A western official said there was ""big concern"" he could create another Grozny, the Chechan city pummelled in the 1990s.

Soldiers fed Putin's lie that they would be welcomed as liberators are struggling to occupy cities because of resistance.

The official said the plan was to ""walk in, decapitate the local leadership and receive the adulation of a welcoming population"".

They added Russia would likely resort to ""brutalise the population"" and ""destroy"" the cities to save face.

Failure to completely capture a single Ukrainian is humiliating Putin who has lost four top generals and has not ""achieved a strategic breakthrough at any point"".

His legendary paratroopers have also been picked off by plucky Ukrainians.

Taras Kuzio, an Associate Research Fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, says dozens of Russian paratroopers were killed in their doomed bid to take Hostomel airport.

outheast Asian defence ministers meet in Indonesia alongside key players in the Indo-Pacific this week, with the ASEAN bloc set to reinforce a message of centrality as major powers jostle for influence in the region.

The annual get-together, which starts on Wednesday, comes as conflict rages in the Middle East and Ukraine and as tensions ratchet up in disputed waters in the South China Sea, where China is being accused of aggression against the Philippines, which has US backing and seeks to boost its military ties with Japan.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) chair Indonesia has yet to confirm attendees, but among them is US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who will meet ASEAN counterparts on Wednesday.

The talks will expand on Thursday to include Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, India, New Zealand and Australia.

ASEAN, a region of about 660 million people with a combined gross domestic product of more than $3.2 trillion, has for years been courted by Washington and Beijing, but their fierce rivalry has caused its members concern.

""Competition is good. But competition should not deteriorate into a zero-sum game,"" Defence Minister and presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto told a foreign policy forum this week, where he stressed the importance of non-alignment.

Relations between China and the United States have been frosty after President Joe Biden ordered the shooting down in February of a suspected Chinese spy balloon.

It was unclear who will represent China at the Jakarta meeting after the removal of its defence minister in October, raising questions about the stability of the leadership around President Xi Jinping.

Austin comes to Indonesia from South Korea, where he reiterated concerns about Russia and China helping North Korea to evade sanctions and Moscow's closer military ties with Pyongyang.

Washington has accused North Korea of supplying military equipment to Russia for use in its war with Ukraine, and Moscow of providing technical military support to help the North.

Aaron Connelly, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, said conflict in Gaza and Ukraine and China's moves to block Philippine resupply missions at a disputed reef will most likely feature at the meeting.

""This forum is not one where major geopolitical developments are really addressed or moved forward in any significant way. But we do expect discussions from the US and Philippines on topics like the Second Thomas Shoal, Israel-Hamas, Ukraine,"" Connelly said.

29,EN_UA_014829.txt,"Why the Media Don’t Want to Know the Truth About the Nord Stream Blasts 

 by Jonathan Cook, The Unz Review:

No one but the terminally naïve should be surprised that security services lie – and that they are all but certain to cover their tracks when they carry out operations that either violate domestic or international law or that would be near-universally rejected by their own populations.

Which is reason enough why anyone following the fallout from explosions last September that ripped holes in three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea supplying Russian gas to Europe should be wary of accepting anything Western agencies have to say on the matter.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

In fact, the only thing that Western publics should trust is the consensus among “investigators” that the three simultaneous blasts deep underwater on the pipelines – a fourth charge apparently failed to detonate – were sabotage, not some freak coincidental accident.

Someone blew up the Nord Stream pipelines, creating an untold environmental catastrophe as the pipes leaked huge quantities of methane, a supremely active global-warming gas. It was an act of unrivaled industrial and environmental terrorism.

If Washington had been able to pin the explosions on Russia, as it initially hoped, it would have done so with full vigor. There is nothing Western states would like more than to intensify world fury against Moscow, especially in the context of NATO’s express efforts to “weaken” Russia through a proxy war waged in Ukraine.

But, after the claim made the rounds of front pages for a week or two, the story of Russia destroying its own pipelines was quietly shelved. That was partly because it seemed too difficult to maintain a narrative in which Moscow chose to destroy a critical part of its own energy infrastructure.

Not only did the explosions cause Russia great financial harm – the country’s gas and oil revenues regularly financed nearly half of its annual budget – but the blasts removed Moscow’s chief influence over Germany, which had been until then heavily dependent on Russian gas. The initial media story required the Western public to believe that President Vladimir Putin willingly shot himself in the foot, losing his only leverage over European resolve to impose economic sanctions on his country.

But even more than the complete lack of a Russian motive, Western states knew they would be unable to build a plausible forensic case against Moscow for the Nord Stream blasts.

Instead, with no chance to milk the explosions for propaganda value, official Western interest in explaining what had happened to the Nord Stream pipelines wilted, despite the enormity of the event. That was reflected for months in an almost complete absence of media coverage.

When the matter was raised, it was to argue that separate investigations by Sweden, Germany and Denmark were all drawing a blank. Sweden even refused to share any of its findings with Germany and Denmark, arguing that to do so would harm its “national security.”

No one, again including the Western media, raised an eyebrow or showed a flicker of interest in what might be really going on behind the scenes. Western states and their compliant corporate media seemed quite ready to settle for the conclusion that this was a mystery cocooned in an enigma.

Isolated and friendless

It might have stayed that way forever, except that in February, a journalist – one of the most acclaimed investigative reporters of the past half-century – produced an account that finally demystified the explosions. Drawing on at least one anonymous, highly placed informant, Seymour Hersh pointed the finger for the explosions directly at the US administration and President Joe Biden himself.","['URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided']"
30,EN_UA_021918.txt,"US, China, Israel and others are developing AI killer drones; this poses significant risks 

 by Rhoda Wilson, Expose News:

The Pentagon’s recent developments in AI technology have drawn concern and criticism as they approach the deployment of autonomous AI weapons systems capable of making lethal decisions independently.

The New York Times reports that countries such as the United States, China and Israel are actively working on lethal autonomous weapons empowered by artificial intelligence (“AI”), which can autonomously identify and engage targets.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Critics argue that the use of AI-controlled drones with the ability to autonomously kill humans is a highly alarming development, as it places life-or-death choices on machines with minimal human oversight. Several countries, including Russia, Australia and Israel are opposing efforts by other nations to pass a binding resolution at the United Nations calling for a ban on AI killer drones.

The issue surrounding the deployment of AI weapons has sparked intense debate, with key questions revolving around the role of human agency in the use of force. Austria’s chief negotiator on the matter, Alexander Kmentt, emphasised that this issue is not just a security and legal concern but also an ethical one.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon has revealed plans to deploy swarms of AI-enabled drones as part of their AI weapons programme. These drones, equipped with advanced AI capabilities, are intended to provide the United States with a tactical advantage, countering the numerical superiority of China’s Liberation Army.

US Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks further highlighted the role of AI-controlled drone swarms in reshaping battlefield dynamics, making them harder to plan against, hit and defeat. However, concerns arise regarding human supervision and decision-making capabilities, as some argue that limitations on AI’s autonomy could hinder strategic advantages.

Critics also point to recent incidents where AI drones have been utilised in conflict zones, such as Ukraine’s use of AI-controlled drones during its conflict with Russia. The extent of human casualties caused by these AI drones remains uncertain, raising additional concerns.

Advocacy groups like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots warn that AI technology’s dehumanisation poses significant risks. This dehumanisation could not only impact the use of force but also permeate other aspects of our lives, extending to automation in law enforcement, smart homes, and beyond. The campaign notes the urgent need for a global treaty banning autonomous weapons to prevent the wide-scale production and proliferation of these technologies from potentially falling into the wrong hands.",['Other'],['Other']

he rouble slumped to 100 against the dollar on Monday, hitting three figures for the first time in almost 17 months, struggling under the weight of strong foreign exchange demand and Russia's shrinking balance of trade.

By 0724 GMT, the rouble was 1.4 percent weaker against the dollar at 100.84, passing the 100 threshold for the first time since March 23, 2022.

It lost 1.5 percent to trade at 110.44 versus the euro, also a near 17-month low, and shed 1.3 percent against the yuan to 13.87.

The rouble has chartered a turbulent course since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, slumping to a record low of 120 against the dollar in March last year before recovering to a more than seven-year high a few months later, supported by capital controls and surging export revenues.

Russia's central bank has blamed the rouble's weakening on falling export revenues and recovering imports, but a Kremlin aide on Monday said loose monetary policy was to blame, a sign of discord among Russia's monetary authorities.

Brent crude oil LCOc1, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.9% at $86.05 a barrel, not far from a more than seven-month high hit last week.

The rouble, already under pressure amid robust demand for foreign currency and limited supply from exporting firms, has failed to benefit from strong oil prices.

A trader at a large Russian bank told Reuters the market was confused: ""Everyone is ready for the inflow of revenues from expensive oil, but it seems to be hanging somewhere, and our regulators are somehow indifferent, there is nothing to rely on.""

Russian stock indexes were higher.

""The unstoppable and puzzling growth of the USD/RUB rate...continues to support retail investors' interest in equities as a way to save their depreciating rouble savings,"" said Sinara Investment Bank in a note.

The dollar-denominated RTS index .IRTS was up 0.2 percent to 1,002.7 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 1.6 percent higher at 3,205.4 points, at a pre-invasion high.

 The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Western sanctions on Moscow, have sent energy and food prices soaring in recent weeks, while rising natural gas prices also have impacted fertilizer production, which in turn hurts farmers.

ajor international organizations issued an appeal Wednesday for urgent measures to deal with rising food insecurity in poor countries, including financing to support farmers and increase food supplies.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Western sanctions on Moscow, have sent energy and food prices soaring in recent weeks, while rising natural gas prices also have impacted fertilizer production, which in turn hurts farmers.

""It is critical to quickly provide support for food insecure countries in a coordinated manner,"" the heads of the IMF, World Bank, World Trade Organization and UN World Food Program said in a joint statement.

Protests have erupted in some countries over high prices, and the statement said, ""The increase in food prices and supply shocks can fuel social tensions in many of the affected countries, especially those that are already fragile or affected by conflict.""

The organizations called on the international community to provide financing for emergency food supplies, a safety net for poor families and farmers, and to increase agricultural production.

They also called for ""open trade"" that avoids export restrictions or ""humanitarian food purchases.""

While the poor nations are most vulnerable to the crisis, middle income countries increasingly are at risk, the statement said.

""Surging fertilizer prices along with significant cuts in global supplies have important implications for food production in most countries, including major producers and exporters, who rely heavily on fertilizer imports,"" they said.

IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva, World Bank President David Malpass, WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and WFP director David Beasley issued the statement before next week's meeting of the IMF and World Bank.

Increased fragility

The war in Ukraine came as the global economy was trying to right itself following the COVID-19 pandemic, while navigating supply chain snarls that created shortages and a surge in inflation.

New lockdowns in China have added further uncertainty to the recovery.

Ukraine is a key source of grain while Russia is a major producer of energy and fertilizer needed for agriculture.

Protestors in Peru have taken to the streets to demand government action, as did people in Sri Lanka, where the government on Tuesday announced it was defaulting on its US$51 billion in foreign debt.

Poverty rose sharply during the pandemic, and the World Bank warns that for each one percentage point increase in food prices, 10 million people are thrown into extreme poverty worldwide.

""Sharply higher prices for staples and supply shortages are increasing pressure on households worldwide and pushing millions more into poverty,"" the officials said.

33,EN_UA_000104.txt,"Senate blocks sanctions aimed at stopping Nord Stream 2 pipeline 

 The Senate blocked a measure to impose new sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany after the Biden administration warned it could disrupt allied unity in the confrontation over Ukraine.

The measure by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas failed on a vote of 55 to 44. It needed 60 votes to pass.

The vote was held open for several hours as Democrats grappled with a setback on unrelated voting rights legislation.

“Russia has nakedly and unequivocally used energy as energy blackmail,” Cruz said Thursday on the Senate floor. President Vladimir Putin has done that “openly, brazenly and laughingly and absolutely nothing happened,” Cruz said.

Opponents of the measure said it would damage U.S. cooperation with Germany and other NATO partners as they try to head off a potential invasion of Ukraine by Putin’s forces deployed on its borders.

The bill “would undermine the current diplomatic situation,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who had introduced earlier sanctions proposals with Cruz. “We are in a very different situation right now” than when two earlier bills were passed.

The Biden administration also has argued that imposing new sanctions on the undersea pipeline now could undercut the US’s ability to persuade other European nations to join in severe economic penalties later if Russia invades Ukraine.

The legislation “will not counter further Russian aggression or protect Ukraine,” Emily Horne, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement Wednesday. “Instead, it will undermine our efforts to deter Russia and remove leverage the United States and our allies and partners possess in this moment all to score political points at home.”

The White House backed an alternative plan from Senator Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, that would make the sanctions contingent on Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Nearly 40 senators have signed on to that bill.

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the pipeline is what’s divisive. Unlike an older Nord Stream pipeline, the new one bypasses Ukraine.

“The government of Germany should have shelved this project itself a long time ago,” McConnell said. “These sanctions, like the prior Nord Stream 2 sanctions that had overwhelming bipartisan support here in Congress, are not about driving a wedge in Europe. The pipeline itself is the wedge.”

McConnell called for a stronger stance against Russia, saying on the Senate floor that the US should extend additional humanitarian and military support to Ukraine.

“We must not pull our punches out of some fear of provoking Putin,” he said. “What will encourage Putin is if he senses American weakness.”

Construction of the new pipeline is essentially complete, but Germany has yet to issue the certification required for it to begin operating.

34,EN_UA_001032.txt,"Russia-Ukraine war map: Where are Russian troops positioned around Ukraine? 

 RUSSIA is demanding the surrender of Mariupol, while trying to position themselves within range of crucial cities.

At least eight civilians have died in a Russian attack on a large shopping centre just outside the Ukraine's capital Kyiv.

Where are Russian troops in Ukraine now?

An estimate of 190,000 Russian troops have been deployed in and around Ukraine for the invasion.

Russia has admitted around 10,000 of their troops have been killed.

Despite peace talks on the Belarusian border, the Ukraine war rages on with no hint of whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will withdraw his troops.

Russia has military control over much of Ukraine's southern regions but is fighting to take control of Mariupol.

The city is surrounded by Russian forces but Ukraine refuses to surrender.

Ukrainian forces are holding on to important cities like Kharkiv and Kyiv as well as Odesa, which is a crucial connection to supplies.

Capital Kyiv remains under Ukrainian control with the nearest Russian troops about 15 miles from the city centre.

Troops attacked the Retroville mall just outside Kyiv in the Podilskyi district, killing eight civilians.

In the north of the country, Russian troops are attempting to surround the city of Sumy.

Many civilians have joined Ukrainian forces in the fight for their homeland.

Which parts of Ukraine has Russia invaded?

Russia has made large sweeps in the south of Ukraine, using Crimea and the separatist supporters in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Troops moved into the Kherson region from Crimea - a territory that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Kherson and Melitopol areas of Ukraine are under control of Russian forces.

There is strong Russian presence in Chernobyl and the surrounding area.

Northern cities of Chernihiv and Konotop, which are closest to the Russian and Belarusian borders, have also been taken.

Why has Russia invaded Ukraine?

Unrest in the Donbas region began in 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea.

Pro-Russian demonstrations escalated into fighting with the Ukraine government forces.

The Minsk agreement of 2015 – between the separatist leaders, Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany – sought to end fighting in the region but without success.

The much feared Russian advance began in the early hours on February 21, 2022, soon after Putin announced he recognised Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states in a bombastic TV address.

Joe Biden and Boris Johnson condemned the move as an ""invasion"" and slapped sanctions on Russian banks and Putin's billionaire cronies.

35,EN_UA_013344.txt,"I was a KGB spy along side Putin and he IS using body doubles – these simple signs are a dead giveaway that he’s a fake 

 A FORMER spy alleges a body double stands in for Vladimir Putin at key events – and has revealed what he says are the tell-tale signs.

Sergei Zhirnov claims to have served alongside the Russian tyrant in the KGB intelligence service of the former Soviet Union, which is now known as the FSB.

Zhirnov said he had believed until now that claims of Putin using doppelgangers were “conspiracy theories”.

But he has now changed his mind, citing a speech made by a “skinny” and coughing Putin on February 21 and contrasting it with an appearance at a pro-war concert next day in Moscow as evidence.

Footage highlights him waving his hands around and repeatedly touching his nose, not traits especially common with Putin.

Zhirnov told Ukrainian TV that “a totally different Putin pops up” with “a wider face as if he bloated in 24 hours”.

""He has a totally different shape of eye orbits, a totally different head, absolutely different wrinkles - a different voice.”

Far from shunning people, perhaps to avoid Covid, he was “almost kissing and hugging everyone”.

His allegation comes as a video shows an unusually exuberant Russian president at a helicopter plant in Siberia.

Zhirnov is now exiled in France and was a former classmate of Putin at KGB Red Flag Institute, a spy training centre.

The claim Putin uses a body double has also been made by the head of Ukrainian military intelligence.

Major General Kyrylo Budanov claimed the body doubles are used to hide Putin’s loss of control in the Kremlin.

He claimed Ukrainian secret services detected Putin body doubles standing in for him on a number of ""special occasions"" in the past, but this had become ""usual practice"" now

""We know specifically about three people that keep appearing, but how many there are, we don't know,"" Budanov said.

""They all had plastic surgery to look alike.""

The spy chief alleged all the doubles had surgery but said the one thing that gives them away is their height.

“It's visible in videos and pictures. Also gesturing, body language and earlobes, since they are unique for every person.""

The claim that Putin uses body doubles is also regularly made by the General SVR Telegram and YouTube channel, which claims to be run by a Kremlin insider.

Most experts dismiss such claims as absurd and far-fetched, though several noticed Putin’s unusually buoyant mood in Siberia, compared to recent public appearances in Moscow.

One claim was that Putin had had an extra dose of medicine.

It has been alleged body doubles were used by former Soviet leaders Josef Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev.

Putin three years ago admitted that officials had considered using doubles, but he claimed the idea was rejected.

""I discarded the idea of any doubles,” he said.

He admitted the idea came up in the early 2000s when Russia was hit by terrorist attacks.

It was suggested a lookalike should take his place at events where the head of state might be at risk, he said.

36,EN_UA_027787.txt,"Russia Says US Is Responsible for Deadly Ukrainian Attack on Crimea 

 MOSCOW—Russia said on Sunday that the United States was responsible for a Ukrainian attack on Crimean peninsula with five U.S.–supplied missiles that killed four people, including two children, and injured 151 more.

The Russian Defence Ministry said four of the U.S.–delivered Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, equipped with cluster warheads, were shot down by air defense systems and the ammunition of a fifth had detonated in mid-air.

Footage on Russian state television showed people running from a beach and some people being carried off on sun loungers.

Russian authorities in Crimea said missile fragments had fallen just after noon near a beach on the north side of the city of Sevastopol where locals were on holiday.

The incident generated a furious reaction among Russian public figures.

The Defense Ministry said U.S. specialists had set the missiles’ flight coordinates on the basis of information from U.S. spy satellites, meaning Washington was directly responsible.

“Responsibility for the deliberate missile attack on the civilians of Sevastopol is borne above all by Washington, which supplied these weapons to Ukraine, and by the Kyiv regime, from whose territory this strike was carried out,” the ministry said.

Russia sent its troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

The United States began supplying Ukraine with longer range ATACMS missiles, which have a 300-kilometre (186-mile) range, earlier this year.

Treating the InjuredSevastopol Governor Mihail Razvozhaev put the death toll at four, with 144 injured, including 82 taken to hospitals. Twenty-seven children were among the injured.

Specialist doctors were being flown in from other parts of Russia.

Russia will respond to Sunday’s attack, the Defense Ministry said, without elaborating. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had been “in constant contact with the military” since the attack.

Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council, described the incident as “a vile, despicable act against our people.”

He likened it to attacks carried out by gunmen on Sunday against a synagogue, a church, and police post in Dagestan and said there was “no difference to us” between the U.S. administration, Ukrainian leaders, and “crazy fanatics.”

Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill said there “was no justification whatsoever for a missile strike on civilians” and expressed indignation that the incident occurred on the Orthodox holiday of Trinity.

Neither Ukraine nor the United States has commented on the attack, which came on a day when Ukraine said one person had been killed and 10 others wounded by Russian strikes on the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: UA is anti-RU extremists', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other']"

 CIA's Burns & SecDef Austin In Separate 'Urgent' Trips To Ukraine As War Effort Implodes

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday showed up in Kiev during an unannounced visit, and at an awkward moment for US-Ukraine relations given President Zelensky has been publicly complaining over a decrease in artillery shell supplies, given they are now going to Israel for its war in Gaza.

""I was honored to meet with President @ZelenskyyUa in Kyiv today to reaffirm the United States’ steadfast support for Ukraine,"" Austin wrote on X. ""We, along with our allies and partners, will continue to support Ukraine’s urgent battlefield needs and long-term defense requirements,"" Austin added.

This convenient shift of Washington and the Pentagon to talking mainly about ""long-term defense"" began occurring as it became clear Ukraine's counteroffensive was failing.

But Congress has been dragging its feet on passing Biden's latest supplemental funding requests - again given there's been some wrangling over what gets sent to Israel vs. what's set aside for Ukraine.

This is Austin's second trip to Kiev since the Russian invasion. ""I’m here today to deliver an important message – the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine in their fight for freedom against Russia’s aggression, both now and into the future,"" he said.

Just last week, CIA Director William Burns also made a secretive, unannounced visit to Ukraine to hold urgent meetings with Zelensky and top military and intelligence officials. Commentary in Asia Times has concluded that this flurry of activity is in response to how badly things are going on the battlefield. Washington has invested many tens of billions of dollars into what's clearly a 'proxy war' against Russia. Asia Times wrote:

Wednesday, November 15th is Z-Day for the War in Ukraine. CIA Chief William Burns will arrive in Kiev for urgent, secret meetings with Zelensky. It is worth asking: How come Burns is on an urgent mission to Ukraine?

The answer to the question is that Ukraine is imploding. The crumbling of the Zelensky regime is unsurprising: Ukraine has been sustaining far too many casualties to survive for much longer. Ukraine either must find a way to make a deal with Russia or face an internal rebellion.

Indeed, there have been recent media rumors and rumblings that Washington has begun to quietly push Kiev to the negotiating table. Was this in any way the focus of these new visits by Burns and Austin?

""The Russian strategy is to bleed-down Ukraine’s armed forces and create a political crisis in Kiev,"" the Asia Times report continued. ""The Russian effort is ahead of schedule, which has surprised Moscow as much as Washington.""

Zelensky has lately sacked and replaced many within his own war cabinet. All of this is a sign of deepening friction, also as Zelensky has admitted that the Gaza crisis has taken the international attention off of Ukraine's war efforts. This has led to waning monetary and weapons support as well.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies']"
38,EN_UA_015443.txt,"Ukraine War: Kyiv’s allies fear military support will dry up in US election year 

 Ukraine’s Western allies are concerned that the military support for Kyiv may soon peak, as the US enters a divisive presidential, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing unnamed Western officials.

“Ukraine’s allies fear military support for its battle against Russia is nearing a peak, with senior European officials increasingly concerned about the flow of aid next year as the US enters a divisive presidential campaign,” the Financial Times reported.

According to the FT, Washington has been Kyiv’s major source of military aid. US officials interviewed by the newspaper say the remaining funds preapproved by Congress could sustain Ukraine for about another five months. Western officials in regular contact with the US over Ukraine told the FT that Washington sees that period of time as the last real chance for Kyiv to change the situation on the ground.

“We can’t keep the same level of assistance forever,” a European official told the British newspaper as he argued that the current level of support could be sustained for another year or possibly two years but no more.

Politico reported earlier this week that only $6 billion of the original $48 billion military aid package that the US had approved previously now remains. According to the US publication, Washington’s funds for Kyiv may be fully allocated by mid-summer.

European allies are increasingly uncertain about whether the US will come close to matching its existing $48bn package, adopted in 2022, particularly as it requires a vote in Congress this autumn against the backdrop of more partisan debate on the war, FT reported.

Recently, European leaders promised Zelenskyy an arsenal of missiles, tanks and drones during a whirlwind three-day visit to Italy, the Vatican, Germany, France and the U.K. that sought to replenish Ukraine’s depleted weapons supplies ahead of a long-anticipated spring offensive aimed at turning the tide of the war.

Zelenskyy’s energetic international diplomacy over 15 months of war has persuaded Ukraine’s Western allies to send ever more powerful weapons, from German Leopard tanks to U.S. Patriot missile systems and Storm Shadow cruise missiles from the U.K.

The war in Ukraine that began a year ago has killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes, reduced entire cities to rubble and has fuelled fears the confrontation could slide into an open conflict between Russia and NATO.

39,EN_UA_024847.txt,"Polish Foreign Minister Reveals Biden Knew About Nord Stream Explosion in Advance 

 The United States knew in advance about the attacks on the Nord Stream pipeline, the largest act of industrial terrorism in history, but did not step in to prevent them, according to an interview with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski published today.

In September 2022, Sikorski, then a member of the European Parliament (MEP), insinuated that Washington was complicit in the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipeline.

Sikorski tweeted a photo from the scene of the crime and signed it “Thank you, USA.” The MEP also pointed out Joe Biden’s standing threat to demolish the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. However, his tweet was deleted just a few hours later.

Speaking with Polish news outlet Rzeczpospolita as the Polish foreign minister his week, Sikorski said “If we believe media, it [the attack] was carried out by someone who was interested in it. And the US had preliminary information about this and did not interfere with this move.”

However, Sikorski chose not name those responsible for the crime.

Almayadeen reports: US investigative journalist and Pulitzer award winner Seymour Hersh said on February 8 2023 that US Navy divers planted explosives to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022.

“Last June, the Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as BALTOPS 22, planted the remotely triggered explosives that, three months later, destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, according to a source with direct knowledge of the operational planning,” Hersh wrote in his Substack newsletter.

The White House responded and dismissed the claims as “false and complete fiction.”

Flightradar24 data showed in late September 2022 that US military helicopters habitually and on numerous occasions circled for hours over the site of the Nord Stream pipeline incident near Bornholm Island.

German media, ZDF and Der Spiegel said that there is no evidence of Russia’s involvement in the pipeline explosions.

The news outlets added that there is growing evidence that agents linked to Ukraine may be behind the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet China’s Xi Jinping for talks in Beijing in October, the Kremlin said on Tuesday, Putin’s first known trip abroad since an arrest warrant was issued against him over the deportation of children from Ukraine.

Nikolai Patrushev, a close Putin ally and the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, said Russia and China should deepen cooperation in the face of the West’s attempt to contain them both.

He was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that the talks in Beijing would be “thorough”, at a meeting in Moscow with China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi.

Putin will attend the third Belt and Road Forum after an invitation by Xi during a high-profile visit to Moscow in March.

Days before that visit, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for Putin’s arrest on suspicion of illegally deporting hundreds of children or more from Ukraine.

Moscow denies the allegations and the Kremlin said the warrant was evidence of the West’s hostility to Russia, which opened a criminal case against the ICC prosecutor and the judges who issued the warrant.

Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine early last year has triggered one of the deadliest European conflicts since World War Two and the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

Putin has pivoted towards China, and Xi has stood by him.

Chinese-Russian trade has soared since the invasion, and Russia has sold Asian powers including China greater volumes of the oil it can no longer sell to the West because of sanctions.

Putin last visited Beijing in February 2022, days before the invasion, where he and Xi announced a ‘no limits’ partnership. Moscow says this does not mean a military alliance, however.

The United States sees China as its gravest long-term “strategic competitor” and Russia as an “acute threat”.

China has refrained from condemning Russia’s operation against Ukraine or calling it an invasion, in line with the Kremlin, which casts the war as a “special military operation”.

Earlier this year, CIA Director William Burns said Russia was becoming more and more dependent on China and was even at risk of becoming its “economic colony” in time.","['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Russia has international support from a number of countries and people', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic']"

""Russia does not feel threatened"": Estonian Prime Minister calls for long-range missiles to be transferred to Ukraine

Western countries should provide the Armed Forces of Ukraine with all the weapons they need to liberate all the territories seized by Russia. First of all, Kyiv needs to be provided with long-range missiles.

This was the call to the West made by Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas in an interview with The Kyiv Independent published on Sunday, January 14. In her opinion, this is the only way to repel the aggressor country.

The head of the Estonian government reminded that Tallinn had officially decided to provide Kyiv with annual aid of 0.25% of its GDP over the next 4 years. She called on partners and allies to make the same decision.

Kallas said that the joint budgets of the countries that are members of the Ramstein format contact group on Ukraine's defense are ""much larger"" than Russia's budget.

""Every month, Moscow spends about 5.3 billion euros on the war. If we take the total budgets and this 0.25% of the GDP of all the states of the Ramstein coalition, it will be 120 billion. Such assistance would turn the tide in Ukraine's favor. The partners should provide Kyiv with all the military equipment they have,"" said the Estonian prime minister.

The absence of long-range weapons in the Ukrainian army gives the Russian occupation forces an advantage to seize more territories, Kallas noted.

""If they (Russians - Ed.) think they can win, then of course they don't feel threatened and just keep hitting Ukraine,"" the official said.

She also added that some Western countries are afraid that Moscow will lose and what consequences it will have. According to Kallas, the main task now is to end the war.

Speaking in the Estonian parliament on January 11, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine must win the battle against Russia because it is about the survival of the Ukrainian people.

As OBOZ.UA previously reported, the head of state called on the West to strengthen support for Ukraine. He emphasized that the Armed Forces of Ukraine need more shells, and they will move forward.

 If Finland decides to allow a “concentration” of troops on its border with Russia, it would be viewed by Moscow as a threat, the Kremlin said, after Poland offered to send military advisers to help Helsinki monitor the frontier.

The head of the Polish National Security Bureau, Jacek Siewiera, said in a post on social media X that Poland would send military advisers to its NATO ally Finland, in response to “an official request for allied support in the face of a hybrid attack on the Finnish border”.

“A team of military advisers will provide on-site knowledge on border security, also in operational terms,” he said.

Finland said on Thursday it was unaware of the Polish offer. It has closed its entire 1,340 km (833 mile) border with Russia for two weeks in a bid to halt an unusually large flow of asylum seekers that Helsinki says amounts to a “hybrid attack” orchestrated by Moscow, a charge the Kremlin denies.

Asked about the Polish offer to Finland during a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “This is an absolutely redundant measure to ensure border security because there is no threat there.”

“The Finns must be clearly aware that this will pose a threat to us - an increase in the concentration of military units on our borders.”

Any planned deployment would be unprovoked and unjustified, said Peskov.

Finland’s Border Guard and the interior ministry both said they were unaware of any plan to bring Polish military advisers to Finland’s eastern border.

Finnish President Sauli Niinisto held talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda in Warsaw last week but they did not discuss military cooperation on the Finnish border with Russia, Niinisto’s office said in a statement to Reuters.

Finland infuriated Russia earlier this year when it joined NATO, ending decades of military non-alignment, due to the war in Ukraine.","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West: The conflict will increase the Ukrainian refugee flows to Europe', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided']"

 A top Russian military spy has been bombarded with sex toys after his personal email was hacked.

Ukrainian hackers claim they gained access to Sergey Morgachev's AliExpress account, ordering multiple sex toys and gay pride flags in his name.

The embarrassing hack was intended as ""a symbolic act of moral humiliation.""

Morgachev is Vladimir Putin's Lieutenant Colonel at Moscow's chief intelligence office, the GRU.

It is believed he was in charge of Russia's notorious ""Fancy Bear"" hackers, also known as APT28.

The hackers, who call themselves Cyber Resistance, claimed on Telegram that they had managed to break into Morgachev's email account.

Then, they were able to access personal information such as family photos and scanned documents of people associated with him, according to the open-source intelligence site Info Nampalm.

Referring to Morgachev in a message after the theft, the group said ""a very cool and clever hacker, but... We hacked him"".

The hack is considered to appear ""pretty credible"" by Ukrainian hacking expert Stefan Soesanto, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.

Info Nampalm reported that the hack confirmed Morgachev's identity by sifting through stolen personnel files.

Among these was a document that showed him to be a department head in Unit 26165.

The Russian hacker was accused by the FBI of holding the same position in 2018.

He is on the FBI's wanted list for his part in hacking senior US Democrats including Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump's presidential election in 2016.

It is said Morgachev and the GRU ""knowingly and intentionally conspired… to gain unauthorised access into the computers of US persons and entities involved in the 2016 US presidential election,"" according to a federal indictment filed by the Department of Justice.

In the document, he is described by the FBI as an officer in Russia's military spy agency, in a department ""dedicated to developing and managing malware.""

Modernity.news reports: Much of the legacy media initially blamed Russia for attack, claiming it was a false flag but offering no sensible reason as to why Moscow would target its own energy infrastructure.

However, during an appearance on German broadcaster WELT-TV, August Hanning, who served as the head of Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service (BND) from 1998 to 2005, the attack was carried out at the behest of Zelensky and Andrzej Duda.

According to Hanning, the act of sabotage occurred as a result of an “agreement between the highest officials in Ukraine and Poland.”

“There were agreements between Zelensky and Duda to carry out the attack,” said Hanning.

As we highlighted yesterday, Germany issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diver believed to be involved in the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines, but Polish authorities failed to stop him at the border and he is now believed to be back in Ukraine.

Berlin issued a European arrest warrant for Ukrainian citizen Volodymyr Z. after identifying him as the chief suspect for placing the explosives that destroyed the pipelines, but Polish authorities claimed they didn’t apprehend the suspect as a result of Berlin not including his name in a database of wanted persons.

The pipeline attack was preceded by warnings from the White House that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would spell the end for Nord Stream 2.

On January 27, 2022, Under-Secretary of State Victoria Nuland stated, “If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.”

On February 7, 2022, President Biden said, “If Russia invades… again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.”

In February 2023, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh published a report asserting that the pipelines were destroyed by the US as part of a covert operation.

According to Hersh’s sources, the explosives were planted in June 2022 by US Navy divers under the guise of the BALTOPS 22 NATO exercise and were detonated three months later with a remote signal sent by a sonar buoy.

It remains to be seen conclusively who ordered and carried out the attack, but the argument that Russia was behind it is looking increasingly tenuous.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Distrust towards Media']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda']"
46,EN_UA_014014.txt,"End overseas trade settlement in dollar, use your own currency: Brazil President Lula to BRICS nations 

 Beijing: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has called for the BRICS nations to give up US dollar and come up with their own alternative currency to settle cross-border trade.

During his first state visit to China since taking office in January, Lula also lashed out the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and criticised the outsize role of the greenback in global trade.

His comments came mere days after the Brazilian government ditched dollar as an intermediary and announced a deal to trade in local currency with China.

Lula voices for de-dollarization

Lending his voice to China’s efforts to shed the dollar’s dominance and promote the use of the renminbi (RMB)/ yuan in overseas trade settlement, the Brazilian President said: “Who was it that decided that the dollar was the currency after the disappearance of the gold standard?”

“Why can’t we do trade based on our own currencies?” he said during his address at the New Development Bank in Shanghai, known as the “BRICS bank”.

“Every night I ask myself why all countries have to base their trade on the dollar,” Lula added.

It is being said that at the BRICS annual summit in South Africa, the member countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – will create a new currency to facilitate overseas trade. The final agreement could come up as early as in August this year.

As per reports, Russia is behind the idea of the alternative currency as it continues to face economic sanctions from the West over its invasion of Ukraine.

Don’t chase dollars

“Why can’t a bank like the BRICS bank have a currency to finance trade between Brazil and China, between Brazil and other BRICS countries?… Today, countries have to chase after dollars to export, when they could be exporting in their own currencies,"" Lula said.

Hitting out at the IMF, Lula alluded to accusations the global lenders’ overly harsh spending cuts on cash-strapped countries like Brazil’s neighbour Argentina in exchange for bailout loans.

“No bank should be asphyxiating countries’ economies the way the IMF is doing now with Argentina, or the way they did with Brazil for a long time and every third-world country,"" he said.

“No leader can work with a knife to their throat because (their country) owes money,"" he added.

Brazil-China trade

Trade between Brazil and China soared over the past decade to $150.4 billion in 2022.

China imports agricultural commodities and minerals from Brazil apart from investing in the Latin American country’s consumer market and infrastructure sector.

Earlier this week, the Brazilian branch of the state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China settled its first overseas transaction directly in RMB in the country. With the increase in bilateral trade and growing economic relationship, both countries have now been using their respective currencies to settle payments.

Can yuan be the new dollar?

The Chinese yuan’s role in trade finance has more than doubled since the Ukraine war, but at present, it is a poor contender to replace the US dollar as the global currency.

Not only is it virtually pegged to the dollar, China’s tight control of its currency keeps it from adhering to free market flows.

British colonel: Ukrainian operation in Kursk region humiliated Putin and showed cowardice of allies

The first major attack on Russian territory since World War II, the Ukrainian Armed Forces' offensive in the Kursk region, has publicly humiliated Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. However, he is not the only one who was humiliated and stunned by the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian territory. Ukraine's partners, among those who provide weapons but restrict their use, are in the same position.

This is the opinion of Colonel Richard Justin Kemp, a retired British Army officer and knight, who was awarded the highest honor in the UK. In his opinion, the Ukrainian offensive ""showed the cowardice of the allies,"" especially US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Sir Richard Kemp recalls how President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously asked Western partners to allow the use of long-range weapons to protect both Ukrainian soldiers and Ukraine in general.

""The British Storm Shadow missiles could make a difference in this battle, but the British government is unwilling to allow them to be used to their full potential. What, in Sir Keir Starmer's opinion, is the point of a strike on Russian territory, apart from protecting Ukraine? And how would the Second World War have ended if the Prime Minister had not allowed British and American bombs to fall on German soil?"" asks the colonel.

According to Sir Richard Kemp, throughout the entire period of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, ""the most pathetic were the Western allies"" who pursued a policy not based on Ukraine's defense needs, ""but on the groundless fear of Russian retaliation."" And although all of Putin's so-called red lines turned out to be nothing more than baseless intimidation, each subsequent Western decision to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, tanks, or combat aircraft ""was reluctant, half-hearted, inadequate, and gripped by fear.""

Incidentally, it was these fears and the ""miserable policy"" of the partners that ensured the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, the Briton believes.

""Ukraine was able to launch an unexpected attack on Russian territory because most of the border with the enemy was left almost unguarded. The fact is that Putin knew that his territory remained virtually invulnerable to attack because of Western restrictions on the use of weapons. This also applies to airfields, supply routes, and logistics bases. Significant forces needed to protect them have been thrown into the war in Ukraine,"" the colonel said.

""What Western leaders don't realize is that when you're facing a tyrant like Putin, escalation is the only language he fears and understands. We see the same thing in the Middle East, where Biden is pleading with Israel to de-escalate. But his unconvincing 'no' will not stop Ayatollah Khamenei from pushing the button and launching Iran's expected missile attack, just as it did not stop Putin from attacking Ukraine,"" Sir Richard Kemp said.

Ukraine's offensive near Kursk has taught the West a ""salutary lesson,"" the military said.

""Despite the capture of thousands of square kilometers of Russia's holy shrines, no nuclear missiles were raining down on Kyiv. The truth is that if Ukraine had been allowed to escalate from the very beginning, it could have brought this war to an end on favorable terms for Kyiv,"" the British colonel believes.

48,EN_UA_001052.txt,"NATO ‘Cautiously Optimistic’ Amid Reports of Russian Troop Withdrawal 

 After Russia announced Tuesday that it will pull out some troops from near the Ukrainian border, top NATO officials expressed that they are “cautiously optimistic” for a de-escalation of tensions.

“There are signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue. This gives grounds for cautious optimism. But so far we have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday morning following Russia’s announcement.

Russia did not say how many units were being withdrawn, and how far, after a build-up of some 130,000 Russian troops to the north, east, and south of Ukraine. Video footage posted online by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Tuesday allegedly showed Russian tanks moving back to their permanent bases and away from the border.

NATO said that it has yet to see evidence of a de-escalation in the crisis.

“Russia has amassed a fighting force in and around Ukraine unprecedented since the cold war. Everything is now in place for a new attack,” Stoltenberg said. “But Russia still has time to step back from the brink, stop preparing for war and start working for a peaceful solution.”

The Kremlin said Tuesday’s developments were proof that Western talk of war had been both false and hysterical.

“February 15, 2022 will go down in history as the day Western war propaganda failed. Humiliated and destroyed without a single shot fired,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement, according to Reuters.

On Monday, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko told Russian media the United States and the West are trying to “spark a conflict” with recent statements about a possible invasion.

“Look, if we planned any war against Ukraine, the media would have behaved completely differently. Because the media is the modern war’s bombardments,” he said.

France said it had yet to confirm the return of some Russian troops to bases, though this would be a positive sign. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, on the latest Western diplomatic mission to defuse the crisis, met Putin in the Kremlin.

Over the past weekend and on Monday, White House officials called on Americans to leave Ukraine and asserted that an invasion could occur in the near future. No evidence was provided for the second claim.

The U.S. Department of State also shut down its embassy in Kyiv and moved it to Lviv, located in the western part of Ukraine.

“We are in the process of temporarily relocating our Embassy operations in Ukraine from our Embassy in Kyiv to Lviv due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

“These prudent precautions in no way undermine our support for or our commitment to Ukraine. Our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering,” Blinken added, noting that “the path for diplomacy” is available.

Around the same time, confusion was sparked when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a statement on Facebook that said Russia would invade on Feb. 16. However, his office later said that he made the remarks sarcastically in an apparent attempt to make light of various Western intelligence reports suggesting an imminent invasion.",['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader'],['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors']
49,EN_UA_016466.txt,"The Threat from the Kremlin’s Foolish, Never-ending, “limited military operation” in Ukraine continues to Rise 

 Putin’s unwillingness to use sufficient force to end a conflict that should not have lasted one week is leading to much wider war.

NATO at the summit in Vilnius is likely to approve plans to increase the number of troops in a state of high alert to 300,000, as well as other changes in the military structure, said Secretary General Stoltenberg.

Plans to increase the number of its rapid reaction forces to more than 300 thousand. people from 40,000. Stoltenberg said in June 2022. He noted that this will take place within the framework of the implementation of new regional plans.

In May, Stoltenberg said that these plans would be described as a bloc to deter and protect NATO allies from any aggression: they contain precise demands for the transformation of the armed forces, including their deployment. The Secretary General also announced more Allied exercises, bringing more forces into combat readiness, strengthening the command structure and control in the alliance.

As reported in March, the increase in the number of the military may imply the emergence of two echelons. The first will be 100,000. soldiers ready to be sent within ten days. The second echelon is reinforcements, that is, the military sent for support, they will have to be ready for the transfer within 10-30 days.

The Spanish El Pais reported in May that the bloc was finalizing a common strategy to counter the threat from Russia and terrorism. This strategy, according to sources of the publication, is changing NATO’s approaches to deploying forces in different regions and responding to threats from Moscow.

50,EN_UA_024628.txt,"Washington will not let Ukraine fail, US defence chief vows 

 RAMSTEIN AIR BASE - Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised Tuesday that the United States will not let Ukraine fail in fighting off Russia, even as further aid remains stalled in Congress and Kyiv’s forces face shortages of munitions.

The Republican-led House of Representatives has been blocking $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine and the United States has warned that a recent $300 million package would only last a few weeks.

The “United States will not let Ukraine fail”, Austin said at the opening of a meeting in Germany of Ukraine’s international supporters, at which he is seeking to secure further assistance for Kyiv.

“We remain determined to provide Ukraine with the resources that it needs to resist the Kremlin’s aggression,” he said. Washington announced $300 million in assistance for Ukraine last week, but Austin said it was only possible due to savings on recent purchases.

“We were only able to support this much-needed package by identifying some unanticipated contract savings”, Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement the day before that it is “critically important for us that the Congress soon completes all the necessary procedures and makes a final decision” on aid for Kyiv.

Top US military officer General Charles “CQ” Brown told journalists en route to the Ukraine meeting that Kyiv’s troops are “having to pay attention to their supply rates and how they execute.” There is an “incremental kind of back and forth between Ukraine and Russia”, with “incremental gains on both sides”, Brown said.

But he noted that “even as the Russians have gained territory, they do it at a pretty big cost in number of casualties, like in personnel, but also in number of pieces of equipment that are being taken out.”

Austin said in his remarks Tuesday that “Russia has paid a staggering cost for (President Vladimir) Putin’s imperial dreams”, using “up to $211 billion to equip, deploy, maintain, and sustain its imperial aggression against Ukraine.”

“At least 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded” since Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Austin said, adding that Ukraine has also “sunk, destroyed, or damaged some 20 medium-to-large Russian navy vessels.”

The sinkings have been an embarrassment for Moscow and Russian state media confirmed Tuesday that the country had replaced the head of its navy. Austin and other US officials have spearheaded the push for international support for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia invaded and coordinating aid from dozens of countries.

Speaking at the Ramstein US base, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Berlin has offered another half a million euros worth of military aid to Ukraine. “That includes 10,000 rounds of ammunition from the stock of our armed forces,” he told journalists. Germany is Ukraine’s second biggest donor of military support, after Washington, which has committed tens of billions of dollars to aid Kyiv since February 2022.","['URW: Overpraising the West', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support']"

 ""Aren't They Fools?"": Putin Says Ukrainian Statehood Risks 'Irreparable Blow' If War Continues

Russian President Vladimir Putin gave statements on Tuesday which assessed the overall status of the nearly two-year conflict with Ukraine at a moment Western and world leaders meet in Davos for the World Economic Forum (WEF). Zelensky while there in Switzerland pressed Ukraine's case for the need to achieve air superiority.

But Putin in his fresh remarks stressed that not only do Russian forces have the clear upper hand, but he emphasized for the first time that Ukrainian statehood itself risks an ""irreparable"" blow if the war continues. He stressed that Ukraine's military has already ""failed"".

""Not only has their counteroffensive failed, but the initiative is entirely in the hands of the Russian Armed Forces,"" Putin said in the televised remarks. ""If this continues, Ukraine's statehood could be dealt an irreparable, very serious blow,"" he added, but he didn't clarify further precisely what he meant by this.

""They are trying to show that they can also do something. But instead of solving military tasks, they act in such a barbaric way. Attacks are being carried out on peaceful settlements with indiscriminate weapons,"" Putin said in reference to the past several weeks of cross-border attacks on Belgorod city, which have killed and maimed Russian civilians.

Putin further addressed Zelensky's efforts to gather world leaders for a peace summit hosted by Switzerland, to consider Kiev's 10-point peace plan, which it should be noted rejects the possibility of territorial concessions.

""The so-called 'peace formula' that's being talked about in the West and in Ukraine is a continuation of the decree of the Ukrainian president banning negotiations with Russia,"" Putin said, according to a translation in Sputnik.

""As for the negotiating process, it's an attempt to encourage us to abandon the territorial gains we've achieved over the past 1 1/2 years. But this is impossible. Everyone understands that this is impossible,"" the Russian leader continued.

He explained that earlier in the conflict, the two sides were close to serious negotiations that could have led to peace, but that ultimately Zelensky allowed himself to be the puppet of Western powers...

""A day later, they threw all the agreements into the trash, and now they are saying publicly—including the head of the Ukrainian negotiating group—that 'Yes, we were ready, but we missed the chance, because then-Prime Minister of Britain Mr. [Boris] Johnson came and persuaded us not to implement these agreements,'"" Putin said.

He stressed: ""Fools, are they not? They're admitting directly that if they had gone for it, everything could have been ended a long time ago, 1 1/2 years ago.""

Lately, Ukraine has been seeking to get China involved in getting on board with its peace formula. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak on Sunday said, ""China needs to be involved in talks to end the war with Russia."" He issued the words just ahead of the WEF. China remains the most influential Global South country widely viewed as squarely in Russia's corner, having refused to rebuke Moscow or join Western-led sanctions after two years of the conflict. Kiev hopes to get Global South countries on its side, thus further isolating Moscow - but so far this has proved somewhat futile.","['URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies']"

 by Tom Luongo, Tom Luongo:

“The Vorlons say, understanding is a three-edged sword: your side, their side, and the truth”

— John Sheridan, Babylon 5

The biggest media story of 2024 so far has come and gone. Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin last week.

Everyone, even the Davos/UK dominated media, has put forth their opinion on it. I gave out a quick take for my Patrons the morning after just like everyone else. And like everyone else I missed the biggest takeaway from this interview.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Now, if you go through the commentary what you will mostly see is people, as always, doing what traders call “talking their book.” In other words, as opposed to dealing with the information presented and the motivations of the people involved, most media outlets and commentators put forth their opinion on whether this interview satisfied their needs from it.

So, for the hardcore geopolitical types and armchair psychoanalysts, we heard a lot of opinions second-guessing Putin’s strategy to open the interview with a nearly thirty minute recitation of Russian/Ukrainian history. Why would he do this, was the common refrain.

I’ll use my former-bellwether-for-normies, Scott Adams, as an example of this.

How many of you thought Putin was “all there” in the Tucker interview?

If he seemed lucid to you, it’s because Biden is your comparison.

I thought Putin seemed unhinged. The history lesson was not a good sign. https://t.co/VZiEIHRZ2t

— Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) February 9, 2024

This was the kindest of the ‘bad takes’ I found on this. But I’m having one of Scott’s “One movie, two screens,” moments here. Because Putin looked anything other than “unhinged.” In fact, he looked as calm as I’ve ever seen him, taking a relaxed posture to put Carlson, who was clearly unsure of where he stood at the beginning of the interview, at ease.

But this is the message that Adams wanted to see, framing Putin in relation to Biden, because he needed something unique to say to justify his even being in the conversation.

By contrast, Martin Armstrong had a great post curating all of the crazy Neocon takes from the “media” on his blog over the weekend.

What’s obvious from those is that they understood that Putin’s 30 minute opening monologue would put off a lot of casual watchers who would tune him out at that point. So, their “analysis” focused on steering the conversation to Putin’s ‘false history’ of Russia and Ukraine.

This way that ‘false history’ would dominate everyone’s opinions the next day, managing the Overton Window of the entire interview, making it all about that. This would be the basis of how they discredit Putin.

Then to discredit Carlson, people like Hillary Clinton was trotted out to lie about Tucker Carlson, calling him a “useful idiot,” and “puppy dog” and a joke in Russian media, which is an outright lie. Hillary’s harpy laugh made an appearance alongside a sycophant interviewer as they joked about Carlson’s having been fired from every legitimate news agency.

We were treated to a common sight: Two Beltway insiders laughing inside their echo chamber and only our sick fascination with roadkill makes it even remotely interesting.

So, the whole exercise is reframed as Puppy Dog Tucker throwing softballs to Liar Putin to distract us away from the sum and substance of their talk.

 Russia will win the special operation in Ukraine if the society shows consolidation and composure to the enemy, President Vladimir Putin said during a visit to the Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant on March 14, Rossiya 24 TV channel said.

Russia is not improving its geopolitical position in Ukraine. Instead, Russia is fighting ""for the survival of Russian statehood, for the future development of the country and our children.""

""In order to bring peace and stability closer, we, of course, need to show the consolidation and composure of our society. When the enemy sees that our society is strong, internally braced up, consolidated, then, without any doubt we will come to reach what we are striving for — both success and victory,"" Putin said.

According to him, many of the current problems began after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when they tried to put pressure on Russia to ""destabilise the internal political situation.” ""Hordes of international terrorists"" new sent to the purpose to accomplish this goal, Putin said.

Afterwards, the West decided to start rehabilitating Nazism in Russia's neighbouring states, including in Ukraine.

Nevertheless, Putin continued, Russia had long tried to build partnerships with both Western countries and Ukraine. However, after 2014, when the West contributed to the coup in Ukraine, the state of affairs changed dramatically. It was then when they started exterminating those who advocated the development of normal relations with Russia, he said.

According to Putin, Russia was forced to launch the special operation to protect the population. Western countries were hoping to break Russia quickly, but they were wrong, he said adding that Russia managed to raise its economic sovereignty since 2022.

 Letters to the Editor: How the U.S. can fight in Ukraine without leading to nuclear war

To the editor: I read the letters to the editor, and there is a clear divide between those who think the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should confront the aggressor, or whether that’s too likely to cause an escalation in the war.

While many people draw parallels between Hitler and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, there is one very clear difference: Putin has nukes.

Nevertheless, while nuclear annihilation is a risk of escalation, appeasement of war criminals has never tamed them. If Putin is allowed to “take” Ukraine, what is to convince him, then, that “taking” Poland is not equally attainable?

At this point, I don’t like any of the alternatives. I think limited, conventional warfare is in order, utilizing lots of conventional high-tech weaponry. The war should not be escalated beyond that, even if Russia uses chemical or biological weapons.

If the Kraken is already released, what choice do we have but to confront it?

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is horrific and needs to be addressed forcefully by the U.S. and its allies. But why should the U.S. and NATO engage in armed conflict in the latest global tragedy while ignoring or being responsible for much larger humanitarian disasters of the past few decades, which resulted in much higher fatalities?

Like the invasion of Ukraine, these humanitarian disasters unleashed unthinkable death and destruction on innocent people. Unlike the invasion of Ukraine, they took place in nonwhite and non-European locations.

 Russia on Monday said that there is currently “no basis” to hold an arms control and strategic stability dialogue with the US amid the ongoing war between Moscow and Kyiv.

“There is no basis whatsoever for an arms control and strategic stability dialogue with the United States in the face of a total hybrid war being waged against our country … It will be possible to discuss these topics only after the US authorities renounce their openly hostile anti-Russian policy,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a video address to the Moscow Nonproliferation Conference.

Lavrov expressed that efforts to reduce the potential of a conflict between Russia and the US should be “comprehensive in nature” and based on removing NATO’s eastward expansion.

He further said the West is balancing on the “dangerous edge” of a direct military confrontation between nuclear powers, indicating that Moscow is especially concerned that the three nuclear powers in the West are among Ukraine’s main supporters.

“The US-led ‘collective West’ is cynically complementing the deliberate destruction of balanced and equal agreements that do not suit Washington with the promotion of apparently dishonest schemes that would create advantages for the United States,” Lavrov also said.

He argued that the West’s goal is to create a “unilateral military advantage for themselves by setting new limits for nuclear arsenals while formalizing the aggregate Western superiority in the sphere of non-nuclear capabilities,” adding that the US and its allies are enlarging their network of alliances “directed against third countries” to achieve military superiority.

Lavrov went on to say that Russia’s move to revoke the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year was a “logical response to the destructive moves by the US and other Western countries.”

“That said, we remain a full-fledged party to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Not so long ago, we completed the formation of our segment of the International Monitoring System. We are ready to return to the issue of its ratification as soon as the US does this,” he said.

The Russian foreign minister also accused the Western countries of “tailoring” the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to their interests.

“We are convinced that to prevent further degradation of the world situation, maintain durable stability and create realistic disarmament, all countries should pool their efforts to upgrade the international security system relying on the principles of multilateralism, equality and indivisibility.

 NATO Troops Are Operating In Ukraine Disguised As Mercenaries, Russian General Claims

By Magyar Nemzet of Remix News

A Russian general is claiming that NATO troops are in Ukraine, but they are being disguised as mercenaries to justify their presence, with a number of American and Polish bodies found in Avdiivka, the city recently captured by Russian forces over the last few days.

In an interview with Russian newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, General Sergei Rudskoy, chief operations director of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said that NATO military personnel are taking part in the fighting in Ukraine disguised as mercenaries.

“NATO soldiers are taking part in the fighting disguised as mercenaries. They control air defense systems for operational and tactical missiles and multiple rocket launchers, and are part of assault teams,” Rudskoy said. According to him, NATO officers directly shape the military operations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

The Russian state news agency TASS reported that the bodies of soldiers with Polish and American insignia on their clothes had been found in the Russian-controlled Avdiivka.

“The clearing of Avdiivka has revealed quite a few interesting details. In this case, bodies abandoned by Ukrainian armed units with American and Polish insignia sewn on their uniforms,” Igor Kimakovsky, an adviser to the head of the “Donetsk People’s Republic,” told Russia’s TASS/TRANS news agency.

This information cannot be independently verified.

Gen. Rudskoy claims that Ukraine is being used as a proxy against Russia.

“Western countries make no secret of their desire to inflict a strategic defeat on our country. In order to achieve this goal, Washington and Brussels have chosen Ukraine, where anti-Russian, nationalist sentiment has been nurtured since the collapse of the Soviet Union. At present, the Ukrainian people are being used by the United States as cannon fodder for its geopolitical ambitions of world domination. Therefore, the threats to our country today are no less serious than in the years of 1941-1945 last century,” said Gen. Rudskoy.

With the fall of Avdiivka, Ukraine has lost one of the most important cities on the Donetsk frontline, Many believe that the town is now serving as a second Bakhmut, as it was clear months ago that it could only be held temporarily at the cost of tens of thousands of soldiers’ lives.

 Moscow: Russia will ask the UN Security Council for an investigation into Nord Stream gas pipelines explosions in September last year for which it blames the US.

The Russian parliament’s committee for international relations has introduced the motion regarding this and is expected to get approval by the State Duma later this week.

What does the proposal say?

According to a report by TASS, the proposal calls the Baltic Sea pipelines blasts as “an act of international terrorism” and a “monstrous sabotage.""

It seeks from the United Nations to hold accountable both - who gave the order for the explosions and those who carried it out.

“The criminal act has threatened the security of all Eurasia,” the proposal stated.

Giving the reference to the report of American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, the lawmakers blamed US President Joe Biden’s administration, saying it “gave the illegal order and bears full responsibility for the multi-billion-dollar damage to the infrastructure of Russia, Germany, France and the Netherlands.""

They further described the pipeline sabotage as inflicting long-term damage to the security, economy and environment of the entire region.

Hersh in his report alleged that the Nord Stream gas pipelines were damaged in a joint operation between the US and Norway.

US actions require “a thorough international investigation, punishment of those responsible and compensation for the damage caused,” the proposal said.

What Seymour Hersh’s report say?

Last week, Hersh in over 5,000 words report claimed that “top secret and highly-dangerous operation” was carried out by the divers during BALTOPS22, a series of military exercises in the Baltic Sea carried out by 16 NATO countries.

According to him, divers trained at the US Navy’s Diving and Salvage Centre in Florida, planted C4 explosives on three Nord Stream pipelines in June 2022. They were detonated after three months using a sonar buoy which broadcast a signal that triggered the bombs.

He further claimed that the Nord Stream attack was carried out in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

Explosions in Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were reported on 26 September, 2022, an attack that, ostensibly, continues to puzzle investigators.

 Facebook now warns users NOT to ‘call for Putin assassination’ after controversial rule change

FACEBOOK users are now banned from calling for violence against heads of state.

Meta – the parent company of Facebook and Instagram – on Sunday clarified its recent violent speech policy to specifically not include calls for the death of a head of state.

The new announcement by Meta is likely in response to the violent posts users have been sharing towards Russian President Vladimir Putin following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""We do not permit calls to assassinate a head of state… So, in order to remove any ambiguity about our stance, we are further narrowing our guidance to make explicit that we are not allowing calls for the death of a head of state on our platforms,"" Meta global affairs President Nick Clegg said, per Reuters.

Meta's clarification came shortly after the company revealed last week that it would take a more relaxed stance on users calling for violence against Russian forces in the context of the Ukraine invasion.

""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech,"" a Meta spokesperson said.

However, it appears that Meta's initial policy sparked confusion among both Facebook and Instagram users on what type of speech is exactly permitted.

Along with banning violent calls against state leaders, the American tech company also emphasized that their new policy does not allow for hate speech towards Russian civilians.

""We are now narrowing the focus to make it explicitly clear in the guidance that it is never to be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general,"" Clegg said.

""Meta stands against Russophobia. We have no tolerance for calls for genocide, ethnic cleansing, or any kind of discrimination, harassment, or violence towards Russians on our platform,"" Clegg added.

Last Friday, the Kremlin opened a court case against Meta in direct retaliation to the social media giant's violent speech policy.

""A criminal case has been initiated … in connection with illegal calls for murder and violence against citizens of the Russian Federation by employees of the American company Meta,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said, according to Reuters.

The Russian prosecutor general's office asked a court to designate Meta an ""extremist organization"" and ban it from operating in the country after the social media giant changed its hate speech rules on Friday, per the Wall Street Journal.

The prosecutor's office added that Meta's actions not only constitute terrorist activity but also incite ""hatred and enmity"" towards Russian citizens.

Several weeks ago, Russia also announced that it would block civilians' access to Facebook and since then the media platform has been heavily restricted.

59,EN_UA_002991.txt,"Russian On-air Protester Fined, Faces Possible Prison Term 

 NEW YORK—An employee of Russian state television who interrupted a live news program to protest the war in Ukraine was released from custody Tuesday and fined about $270, but still could face a prison sentence.

Marina Ovsyannikova told reporters she was not allowed to sleep while held in police custody and that she was interrogated for 14 hours.

Ovsyannikova, an employee of Channel 1, walked behind the presenter during Monday’s evening news show with a poster saying “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.” In English, it said “no war” at the top of the poster and “Russians against the war” at the bottom.

In a video recorded earlier, she urged Russians to join anti-war protests and said that “Russia is the aggressor country and one person, Vladimir Putin, solely bears responsibility for that aggression.”

The state news agency Tass said Ovsyannikova was fined for the video and remains under investigation for the on-air protest under a law banning dissemination of “deliberately false information” about the use of Russian armed forces. The new law carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence.

Ovsyannikova, whose father is Ukrainian and her mother Russian, spent the night in police custody.

“These were very difficult days of my life because I literally went two full days without sleep, the interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours and they didn’t allow me to contact my family and close friends, didn’t provide any legal support,” Ovsyannikova said.

The court ordered her to pay a fine of 30,000 rubles (about $270) on charges of organizing unsanctioned actions for her call to take part in demonstrations against the war.",['Other'],['Other']

 DRAMATIC video shows a tank storming across the border from Ukraine into Russia today as anti-Putin soldiers claimed to have seized villages.

Drones were also reportedly used in the ""invasion"" as explosions rang out along the frontier in the Belgorod region - where the local governor issued a desperate ""don't panic"" message to residents.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, told residents that to ensure safety of citizens in the region, a ""counter-terrorist regime"" has been introduced.

Russian authorities said a ""Ukrainian Army sabotage group"" crossed the border and forces were ""taking measures to eliminate the enemy"".

Ukrainian intelligence said those involved in the incursion were ""solely Russian nationals"".

The provocative move was claimed by the Freedom of Russia Legion, a unit made up of ethnic Russian volunteers and defectors from the Russian army to fight alongside Ukraine.

In an unverified video today, members of the anti-Putin group posed in front of a road sign and an armoured car.

They claimed: ""We have again crossed the border of the Russian Federation. Russia will soon be free.

""The time to fight for the freedom of Russia has come.

""We want our children to grow up in peace and be free people... but that has no place in today's Putin's Russia.""

Armoured vehicles with Ukrainian markings were also spotted near the border, further fuelling rumours of an invasion by pro-Ukraine Russian saboteurs.

Smoke was spotted in multiple locations near border checkpoints in the region, along with videos online appearing to show a Russian soldier dead inside a checkpoint building.

And a helicopter was reportedly seen flying low over houses and deploying anti-missile flares in Rakitnoye, some 30 miles from the Grayvoron border crossing where the tank was spotted.

One post showed a radio message urgently telling Belgorod citizens to evacuate the area.

Governor Gladkov told residents earlier today: ""No one is hurt, the evacuation from Shebensky district is a lie.

""I urge you not to listen to enemies and not to panic.""

In a post on Telegram, the Freedom of Russia Legion shared a photo of a ""free Russia"" flag on a bridge.

They said: ""The first flags of free Russia met the dawn over the liberated cities. Raise the flags in your cities too. Freedom is near!""

The group claimed they had taken control of Kozinka and Gora-Podol villages.

Rumours spread that up to six other villages came under drone and mortar fire.

The flag raised in the photo is the flag used by Russian anti-war protesters - many of whom live in eastern Ukraine - and is also displayed on the Freedom of Russia Legion's Telegram channel.

It describes them as ""free citizens of Russia"" who are fighting against the ""dictatorial regime"" in Russia.

Another video widely shared online appeared to show the soldiers running into the streets of the southern Belgorod region.

This was followed by aerial shots of border towns showing smoke billowing from multiple buildings.

Russian authorities said administrative building in the town of Golovchino was allegedly struck by a drone, and part of a rocket fell into the garden of a home in the village of Antonovka.

Authorities claimed to have full control of the villages and said they were hunting the ""terrorists"" involved in the incursion.
