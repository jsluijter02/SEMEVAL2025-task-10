 VLADIMIR Putin has honoured an army unit accused of war crimes and genocide in the Russian town of Bucha, reports suggest.

A decree signed by the Russian tyrant gave the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade the title of guards – scandalously praising them for ""mass heroism and valour, tenacity and courage.""

Earlier this month, the Ukrainian ministry identified the unit as those responsible for the alleged rape and murder of innocent Ukrainians.

The barbarous pack, headed by Lieutenant Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - dubbed the “Butcher of Bucha” - left a trail of death and destruction in their wake.

Harrowing pictures from the city, to the north-west of the capital Kyiv, showed the bodies of civilians scattered in the road and in shallow graves — many with bound hands and signs of torture.

Some of them, from the wounds they had suffered, had been shot from close range.

Heavily mutilated corpses of what appeared to be men scattered along the floor of a children's camp as rescue workers carried the innocent victims out in body bags.

A local priest said dogs were seen eating rotting corpses in apocalyptic scenes to grip the commuter town after the troops laid waste to warzones.

Men, women and children were found handcuffed with a bullet in the head and chest as evidence of alleged torture chambers emerged online.

Women and children were also found by Ukrainian soldiers, having been raped and then murdered.

The barbaric troops are believed to have conducted the Bucha slaughter as they scarpered from Kyiv after their botched attempt to take the Ukrainian capital.

Days later, Ukrainian intelligence suggested the troops were being redeployed in Belgorod in Western Russia amid claims that Russian commanders were refusing to rotate their brigades.

The country’s defence ministry claimed troops were being sent to the ""hottest spots"" in the hope they will be slaughtered by Ukrainian fighters before they can testify before a war crime tribunal.

The Kremlin has continued to deny accusations its troops committed war crimes in Ukraine after suggesting chilling pictures of dead bodies strewn across Kyiv streets were staged by Ukraine and the West.

Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky was visibly emotional as he visited the site just days after the mass graves were discovered.

The Ukrainian leader was flanked by security as he vowed to ensure that the “war crimes” committed by Russian soldiers on his country’s soil were “the last such evil on Earth”.

Boris Johnson later described the events as not “far short of genocide” as the EU's Ursula von der Leyen was later seen visiting the scene of the massacre.

It comes as the number of heads of state and former prime ministers backing calls for an international tribunal over Ukraine continues to rise amid widespread international condemnation of the events unfolding in Eastern Europe.

 Former Fox News star Carlson released a two-hour interview with Putin in Moscow last Thursday, just ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia's offensive in Ukraine.

ussian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said he was grateful to controversial right-wing US talk show host Tucker Carlson for his interview last week and ""intermediary"" role with the West.

Former Fox News star Carlson released a two-hour interview with Putin in Moscow last Thursday, just ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia's offensive in Ukraine.

In it, the Russian president said the West needed to understand that it was ""impossible"" for Russia to be defeated in Ukraine.

""Since we are not able to have direct dialogue (with the West) today... we have to be grateful to Mr Carlson to be able to do it by his intermediary"" role, Putin told journalists in quotes distributed by the Kremlin.

Even so, Putin said he was ""not totally satisfied"" with the interview, the first he has given to a Western journalist since launching his offensive in Ukraine.

It has been seen more than 200 million times on X, formerly Twitter.

Putin's disappointment, though, seemed to stem from his hopes for a more bellicose exchange, saying that he expected Carlson to be more ""aggressive"" and was waiting for ""difficult questions"".

""I was not only ready for that but I was hoping for it because that would have allowed me to reply in the same manner,"" Putin said.

Carlson came in for criticism from Western media for the lack of tough questions in the interview, in which Putin lectured him on his views of Russian history, portraying the country as a victim of Western betrayals.

Putin acknowledged that Carlson had ""tried to interrupt me several times"" but praised the conservative journalist, who is close to former US president Donald Trump, for his ""patience"".

The Russian leader did complain, though, that his quotes were ""deformed"" in Western media.

2,EN_UA_011260.txt,"Russia has a clear plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine 

 The conflict in Ukraine may end either by diplomatic or military means. However, it can be possible only after Moscow achieves its goals.

""An opportunity to resolve the conflict will appear only when Ukraine ceases to pose a threat to Russia and discriminate against Russian-speaking Ukrainians,” Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's Ambassador to the UN Security Council, said at a briefing at the UN Security Council.

""If this result can be achieved through negotiations, we are ready for such a scenario. If not, then our objectives will be achieved by military means,"" he added.

Russia is not fighting against the Ukrainian people. Russia is fighting against the criminal nationalist regime that came to power in 2014” after the coup in Kyiv, the diplomat said.

""The new Ukrainian leadership is trying to purge the country of everything connected with Russia and glorify Nazi accomplices. <…>

""The Kyiv regime and its most rabid patrons have forgotten the meaning of the word ""peace."" It is no coincidence that the European Union finances arms supplies to Kyiv through the European Peace Fund, without even thinking about how blasphemous it sounds and looks. <…>

""Ukraine, in fact, has become a NATO PMC. It gets money, weapons and intelligence data. Ukraine receives instructions which targets to attack and where. It is the Ukrainian people who suffer from this in the first place and the people of Ukraine are forced to fight for the sake of someone else's tasks.""

However, the Russian Ambassador to the UN said, everything could have ended differently for Ukraine, if Kyiv had implemented the now-defunct Minsk Agreements that were signed in 2014 and 2015 ""in an attempt to pave the way for peace by granting the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics a special status as part of the Ukrainian state"".

Former Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and ex-president of France Francois Hollande later confirmed that neither sitting President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, nor his predecessors, nor France and Germany, who were involved in the Minks Agreements process, never intended to fulfil them. This diplomatic process served only as a ""smoke screen"" behind which they secretly armed Ukraine against Russia.

Merkel's and Hollande's confessions caused an uproar in Moscow. Russian officials called them a formalisation of betrayal. Interestingly, though, no one in the West was embarrassed about those statements. It appears that the West continues implementing its strategy.

In December, Ukraine put forward the idea of the Global Peace Summit based on Zelensky's ""peace formula."" In that formula, among other things, Zelensky demanded Russia should withdraw its troops from all Ukrainian territories.

Moscow dismissed the plan as it ignored the new status of Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, Kherson, Zaporozhye (Zaporizhzhia) regions and Crimea as part of Russia.

Now Kyiv has a new ""idea"":

The Ukrainian administration wants to hold a ""peace summit"" at UN headquarters in New York on February 24 (one year anniversary since the start of the special operation), but without Moscow's participation.

According to The Associated Press, Ukrainian President Zelenskiy was planning to visit New York in February to address a high-level meeting of the 193-member General Assembly on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine would like the UN General Assembly to adopt two resolutions:

""Peace talks could start after the UN General Assembly passes the resolutions or after the proposed summit is held,"" Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova said.

3,EN_UA_101067.txt,"First war of TikTok era sees tragedy, humor and deceit 

 eart-rending videos of artillery strikes are being served up alongside funny snippets such as bomb-shelter cooking tips and invasion misinformation as the war in Ukraine plays out on TikTok.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, millions of people have tuned into the hugely popular social networking service for news and views of what is happening on the battleground.

That was not lost on United States officials who hosted a video call to brief popular TikTok ""influencers"" on details about the war, according to posts at the social network.

""Lots of people have been turning to digital creators to learn about the invasion of Ukraine,"" read a tweet Friday by Gen-Z for Change, a nonprofit focused on using social media to promote civil discourse.

""Yesterday, we joined the @WhiteHouse and @WHNSC for a briefing on the United States' strategic goals in Ukraine so we're better able to debunk misinformation,"" it added, referring to the White House National Security Council.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, music-themed video clips in Marta Vasyuta's account gave way to images of soldiers and the ravages of war.

Stuck in London, the 20-year-old Ukrainian exchange student uses TikTok to share glimpses of the tragedy inflicted on people still in her home country.

""My mission is to spread information, to not stop talking about that, because it really matters,"" said the economics student from Lviv, whose videos have logged millions of views.

Valeria Shashenok stayed in the city of Cherniguiv, northeast of Kyiv, and switched to English to broaden the reach of her sometimes surreal wartime TikTok posts.

In one, she shows how to cook borscht in a bomb shelter. In another, she walks through rubble to a Rihanna music remix.

The 20-year-old photographer is among those who have not given up on the playful nature of videos considered a trademark of TikTok, which boasts more than 1 billion users.

""I try to keep the humor, because it is my nature,"" said 23-year-old TikTok creator Rimma, who asked for her second name to be withheld.

""I'm living through this trauma. My life is ruined, and there is nothing left for me but irony.""

Her TikTok clips include one of her in a basement in Odessa, quipping that Ukrainians' idea of going for a walk now is a jaunt to the nearest shelter.

She said the line between what was funny and what was hurtful was no longer clear, given the suffering and fear afflicting so many.

But the appetite for wartime content at TikTok appears strong, with Vasyuta and Shashenok seeing their accounts’ subscriber ranks multiply.

Youthful sass

While breaking news events such as armed conflicts have featured on social media for years, TikTok tends to feature spontaneity and a bit of sass that has proven particularly popular with younger audiences.

In the US where members of Gen Z, born in the late 1990s, shun traditional television, online platforms like TikTok are prime sources of news.

""I hope that the kids who watch this war unfold on TikTok become opposed to war [and] realize the horrors and dangers of it,"" said US high school history teacher Chris Dier, who is also a TikTok creator.

""What I don't want is for it to desensitize them and normalize war.""

Young TikTok users were also being ""bombarded"" with propaganda that they likely needed help navigating, said Dier.

TikTok told AFP that it had ramped up resources to detect and counter ""emerging threats"" and ""harmful disinformation"" on the platform.

On March 6, the subsidiary of China-based ByteDance suspended the uploading of videos in Russia in reaction to a new law making it a crime to ""discredit"" the Russian military.

The flow of pro-Russian messages has noticeably declined at TikTok, with the most popular account being state-backed news agency RIA Novosti, which is known for false or discredited claims, such as the alleged existence of secret bioweapons labs in Ukraine.

4,EN_UA_102963.txt,"Ukraine's President Zelenskyy to address Mexico's Congress to gain support in ongoing conflict with Russia, say sources 

 Mexico City: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will address Mexico’s Congress by video on Thursday in an effort to gain support for his nation’s ongoing conflict with Russia, according to two persons with knowledge of the situation.

The leftist president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has come under fire from certain Ukrainian sympathisers for his opposition to European arm supplies to Kyiv. The Mexican administration has stated its desire to maintain neutrality in the crisis.

Nevertheless, Mexico has cast a vote on a number of significant UN resolutions with the United States and other Western nations.

According to the sources, the address was scheduled to start Thursday at about noon.

Zelenskyy’s address to the lower house of Congress came at the invitation of a congressional friendship group between Mexico and Ukraine, according to the sources. There are other similar groups in the Mexican Congress, including one for Russia.

The Ukrainian embassy in Mexico did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The German president and the US ambassador to Mexico have been among the diplomatic allies that have sought to persuade the Mexican government to side with Ukraine against Russia.

Attempts to sway public opinion in Mexico over the war in Ukraine have led to some notable spats in Congress.

Last year, the Russian ambassador to Mexico told Mexican lawmakers that Mexico would never take orders from “Uncle Sam”, prompting the US ambassador to urge Mexico to support Ukraine.

Lopez Obrador last year proposed a plan to halt the fighting in Ukraine, although Ukrainian officials opposed it, arguing it would be advantageous to Russia.

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard met separately with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts to discuss the peace plan at the UN General Assembly in September. Nothing has come of the plan so far.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is currently on a Latin American tour, visiting Brazil, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.

5,EN_UA_022319.txt,"Shapps Says UK Facing ‘Pre-War World’ and Can’t Risk Cutting Defence Spending 

 Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has said Britain is in a “pre-war world” and cannot afford to reduce spending on the military.

In a major speech at Lancaster House in London, Mr. Shapps said the “peace dividend” that followed the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s was over.

Mr. Shapps said: “Because the era of the peace dividend is over, in five years’ time we could be looking at multiple theatres including Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.”

“Ask yourself, looking at today’s conflicts across the world, is it more likely that that number grows or reduces? I suspect we all know the answer. It’s likely to grow,” he added.

Mr. Shapps also announced 20,000 British service personnel would take part in NATO’s largest military exercises since the Cold War, following the announcement last week of a £2.5 billion support package to Ukraine.

Over the weekend the RAF carried out air strikes with U.S. forces on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, after they targeted merchant shipping in their campaign against Israel.

The British government has set a goal of increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP, but Mr. Shapps has argued it should rise to 3 percent.

His speech on Monday—in front of an audience including top brass in the British military—might be seen as pushing the argument for increased defence spending.

Mr. Shapps said, “We made the critical decision to set out our aspiration to reach 2.5 percent of GDP on defence, and as we stabilise and grow this economy we’ll continue to strive to reach that as soon as possible.”

“But now is the time for all allied and democratic nations across the world to do the same thing and ensure their defence spending is growing too,” he added.

‘The Tanks Are Literally on Europe’s Ukrainian Lawn’The defence secretary said: “An age of idealism has been replaced by a period of hard-headed realism. Today our adversaries are busy rebuilding their barriers, old enemies are reanimated, new foes are taking shape, battle lines are being redrawn.”

“The tanks are literally on Europe’s Ukrainian lawn and the foundations of the world order being shaken to their core,” he added.

Mr. Shapps refused to rule out further action against the Houthis following the weekend attacks.

He said the strike against the Houthis was a “single action” but added, “We will now monitor very carefully to see what they do next, how they respond and we will see from there.”

Later Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would “not hesitate” to protect British shipping in the Red Sea.

Mr. Sunak told Sky News, “As we’ve said, not just to the Houthis but to their Iranian masters, in a sense, because they are really proxies for Tehran, this cannot go on.”

“Freedom of navigation is just a given and always has been for many years. We cannot have that situation where they are trying to harass it, and we will keep a very close eye. If we have to take further action, that is something that we will consider,” he said.

He added, “They should be aware that if it doesn’t stop then of course we will then have to take the decisions that need to be taken.”",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

“This is the optics of climate politics, especially when the climate envoy John Kerry takes a flight like this. The White House, they’ve used what’s called an auto-pen before, when presidents have been on trips and have to sign something,” said Fox News host Bill Hammer.

Climate change activist Bill Gates was caught admitting the climate change agenda is a giant scam for the New World Order in a newly surfaced video in which he boasts that the term “clean energy” has “screwed up people’s minds.”

 A top Ukrainian official has appealed for calm as he reassured the nation that an invasion from neighboring Russia was not imminent—despite officials acknowledging there is a real threat as NATO allies have ramped up defenses in the Baltic Sea region this week.

Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s Minister of Defense, said on Monday that at this time, “there are no grounds to believe” that Moscow is preparing an invasion very soon and there is no need for citizens “to have [their] bags packed.”

“Don’t worry, sleep well,” he said, adding that “there are risky scenarios. They’re possible and probable in the future,” though at this time “such a threat doesn’t exist.”

On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also told the nation that the situation is “under control,” while Reznikov affirmed Russia had not formed what he called battle groups, “which would have indicated that tomorrow they could launch an offensive.”

Reznikov’s and Zelensky’s statement in a bid to project calm in order not to destabilize the situation and avoid panic comes as another multi-million dollar shipment of U.S. military equipment arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday.

“Our partners are increasing the amount of military assistance. And today we are meeting the third aircraft from the United States government as part of this assistance,” the defense minister said at a press briefing before the aircraft loaded with defensive aid totaling about $200 million landed at an airport in the capital of Ukraine.

Moscow has repeatedly denied intentions to invade Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the West is showing “hysteria” and is putting out information “laced with lies.”

Peskov on Tuesday again accused the U.S. of “fomenting tensions” around Ukraine, a former Soviet state that has been locked in a conflict with Russia for almost eight years.

Western concern over Moscow planning an invasion of its neighbor started after tens of thousands of Russian troops massed near the Russia–Ukraine border. In 2014, Russia used its military forces to annex the Crimean Peninsula, a move that drew sanctions from then-President Barack Obama. The fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a peaceful settlement have stalled.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 s the world faces the critical challenge of climate change, building nurseries has become one of the key ways to mitigate its effects through reforestation and restoration efforts.

In Indonesia, a notable project is the Rumpin Nursery in Bogor, which has emerged as a prominent model of public-private partnership in supporting Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink initiative. Established in 2022, the Rumpin Nursery was inaugurated by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and is the result of a collaboration between the Environment and Forestry Ministry, the Public Works and Housing Ministry, and APRIL Group, a pulp and paper producer.

APRIL Group's nursery system in Pangkalan Kerinci, Riau province, inspired the Rumpin Nursery development, which has the capacity of planting approximately 200 million new seedlings per year. The company continues to invest heavily in research and development to increase plantation fiber productivity.

Over the next three years, the Indonesian government plans to build 30 nursery centers, each with an annual production capacity of 10 to 12 million seedlings, which will result in a combined annual production of 360 million seedlings. These seedlings will be used to rehabilitate and restore degraded lands, to be planted on critical land, areas with high landslide potential and upper reaches of river basins (DAS).

The Rumpin Nursery has successfully grown and planted thousands of native tree species, including Manglid, Sengon, Salam and Sirsak. Since President Jokowi's inauguration last year, the nursery has begun distributing seedlings in a number of locations such as the Ciliwung River. Following the Rumpin Nursery's successful collaboration, the government is currently focusing on developing additional nurseries in other regions, including Danau Toba, Likupang, Mentawir and Bali.

By replicating and scaling up such models, Indonesia can unlock the potential of nurseries and other nature-based solutions to achieve its ambitious climate goals. This public-private partnership has enabled the Rumpin Nursery to align with the Indonesian government's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 31.89 percent unconditionally by 2030, as per the updated NDC.

As part of its efforts to support Indonesia's restoration and forestry goals, the APRIL Group recently earned an appreciation award for its role in the public-private collaboration that established the Rumpin Nursery.

PT Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper, the operating arm of APRIL Group, also received an appreciation award for its work to improve the performance of industrial forest plantations. Both awards were presented by Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya and received by Sihol Aritonang, president director of PT RAPP.

""APRIL is proud that our technology and seed management system can serve as a reference for nursery development in Indonesia. Through the Rumpin Nursery, we show our continuous support for one of the government's activities in achieving FOLU Net Sink 2030,"" said Sihol.

Indonesia's Forestry and Land Use (FOLU) Net Sink is the newest forest policy in Indonesia that identifies the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) absorption targeted to be equal or higher than emissions in the FOLU sector in 2030. The Net Sink FOLU is projected to contribute up to 60 percent of the Net Zero Emission target by 2060 as part of the country's efforts to achieve its climate goals under the Paris Climate Agreement and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

The key targets of Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink 2030 include efforts to ensure reduced deforestation and forest degradation, the importance of sustainable forest management, social forestry and land rehabilitation, biodiversity and ecosystem preservation.

 During the state visit by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, King [Name] honored K-pop sensation Blackpink with honorary MBEs, acknowledging their role as ambassadors for the COP climate change summit and advocates for the UN’s sustainable development goals, BBC reported.

The King praised Blackpink’s commitment to environmental causes, highlighting their ability to address vital issues while being global superstars. The investiture took place in Buckingham Palace’s prestigious 1844 room, underscoring the significance of this diplomatic exchange with South Korea. Blackpink members—Roseanne Park, Jennie Kim, Jisoo Kim, and Lalisa Manoban—are now honorary members of the Order of the British Empire.

 FACT CHECK: Did Greta Thunberg Say Saving The Banks Would Save The World?

A video shared on social media purports climate change activist Greta Thunberg said to save the banks in order to save the world.

Verdict: False

This video is missing context. Thunberg was not advocating for banks to “save the world.”

Fact Check:

Thunberg recently pulled out of an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book festival, BBC reported. The event was sponsored by the company Baillie Gifford and Thunberg refused to appear at the event claiming that Baillie Gifford, “invests heavily in the fossil fuel industry.”

The Facebook post purports Thunberg suggested the way to save the world is to save the banks. The post shared a small clip from an interview with Thunberg in which the audience claps after her alleged statement.

“The money is there if we can save the banks, we can save the world,” she says in the clip. The caption reads, “GRETA – Saying the quiet parts out loud. The only way to save the planet is to save the banks.”

The clip is taken out of context. Check Your Fact conducted a reverse image and found the clip stems from a conference called, ‘The Right to a Future’ held by The Intercept.

The interviewer asks Greta about her rebuttal to governments saying fighting climate change is “too expensive.” The full exchange features Thunberg arguing that world governments have enough money to help curb climate change suggesting if there is “enough money to bail out the banks, then there is enough money to help the environment.” (RELATED: Did RFK Jr. Meet With Then-President Trump To Lead A Vaccine Safety Commission?)

There is no credible news report that suggests she was making this claim or had recently made such a remark.

 Climate change protesters have been arrested in Melbourne, Victoria after they staged another blockade, this time at the busy Flinders Street Station.

Over 30 climate activists refused to move off the road at the intersection of Flinders and Swanston Streets on March 16. This followed a protest of hundreds of activists who marched from Treasury Gardens to Flinders Street Station in the city later in the afternoon.

The activists were heard yelling, “People power, power to the people,” and, “This is civil disobedience in action.”

“Doing it for the kids I love,” and, “Climate crisis,” were among the signs and banners waved by the group of protesters.

“Free Palestine” signs were also seen among the climate emergency signs displayed on Melbourne streets.

Meanwhile, police arrested 32 people who remained on the runway, and 27 of them will be charged on summons with obstruction of the road.

Police had warned rally organisers who wanted to avoid arrest to leave the intersection, The Age reported.

A spokesperson for Victorian Police told The Epoch Times they attended the planned rally and say about 300 people were there.

“A number of protesters remained at the intersection of Flinders and Swanston Streets after being told to move on by police,” the police said. “32 protesters remained on the roadway and were subsequently arrested. 27 of those protesters will be charged on summons with obstruction of a road.

“Five of those protesters needed to be carried from the roadway by police, four will be charged with intentional obstruction of an emergency worker, and summary hinder police, and bailed to Melbourne Magistrates Court. One will be charged on summons with intentional obstruction of an emergency worker and summary hinder police.”

Extinction Rebellion Victoria posted multiple videos showing footage of the event on March 17.

Multiple Protests Throughout the WeekDuring the week, Extinction Rebellion held multiple “disrupt the city” protests in the city.

“We rebel on the unceded lands of the peoples of the Kulin Nation. Always was, always will be,” the group claimed.

Police were forced to move activists to the footpath on March 13 after they allegedly blocked traffic on LaTrobe and Bourke Streets.

“We are non-violent protesters—we would never resort to violence because we creating the world that we want to see.”

However, the Victorian Police said they respect the right to peacefully protest.

Incident Follows Perth Climate ProtestIn late February, a climate change activist was arrested, and multiple others were issued move-on notices, at a protest against a major Woodside gas project.

The activists were seen holding signs including “oil and gas collapse,” “climate action now,” and “Woodside ecocide blood on your hands,” gathered outside the company’s headquarters in Perth.

Police were seen placing handcuffs on an individual on the road in front of the company’s building on Feb. 20.

This rally was timed to coincide with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese travelling to Perth for three days to discuss the economy, cost of living, and housing at a Federal Cabinet meeting.

Commenting on the incident, a police spokesperson confirmed with The Epoch Times that one person had been charged with obstructing the carriageway.

 Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg this week announced his intent to spend $500 million on a campaign to replace coal plants and prevent the construction of new natural gas plants in favor of renewable energy sources.

The Washington Examiner noted that this $500 million, along with the $500 million Bloomberg previously gave to the ""Beyond Carbon"" campaign, make it one of the largest philanthropic efforts involving climate change ever.

""By working with our partners across the country, we hope to transform the way we power America by moving beyond fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy,"" Bloomberg, a United Nations special envoy on climate ambition and solutions, said during the U.N. Global Assembly in New York on Wednesday.

In a press release, the former mayor's organization Bloomberg Philanthropies announced that it has helped to retire more than two-thirds of all the coal plants in the United States. The group is also helping to fund several environmentalist groups in the country, including Sierra Club, Earthjustice, and the League of Conservation Voters.

Chris Jahn, chief executive of the American Chemistry Council, hit out at the announcement in a statement to The New York Times.

""Attempts to shut down American chemical manufacturing are a bet against millions of hard-working men and women in our industry,"" Jahn said, adding that this program ""would send essential jobs overseas and threaten America's leadership to innovate and compete with countries like China.""

 KHARKIV - Russia pounded over 30 villages and towns in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region after launching a ground offensive in the border region, forcing almost 6,000 to evacuate, the governor said on Monday. Ukraine’s General Staff acknowledged on Monday that Russia “currently is achieving tactical success” after driving a wedge into Kyiv’s defences. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday that troops had “improved the tactical position and dealt a blow to (Ukrainian) manpower” around border villages including Lyptsi and the town of Vovchansk.

“They are shelling the villages, firing on everything they can,” Sergiy Kryvetchenko, deputy head of the military administration in the village of Lyptsi, told AFP. “The KABs (guided aerial bombs) are flying. The artillery is flying. Drones. Everything,” he said.On Friday, Russia began an offensive across its border into the Kharkiv region and later claimed to have taken several villages in the region near the border.

The situation in the Kharkiv region is “complex and dynamically changing”, with Russian troops mounting assaults in various areas, Ukraine’s General Staff said. Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov wrote on social media that over the last day, “more than 30” towns and villages “were struck by enemy artillery and mortar attacks”, wounding at least nine people.

Some areas were also bombed by Russian aircraft, Synegubov added. A total of 5,762 people have been evacuated from their homes since the start of the offensive, the governor said. Over the course of Sunday, Russia “carried out 22 assaults” in five border areas, 14 of which were still ongoing, the General Staff said. The General Staff said fighting was ongoing for the border town of Vovchansk, where Russia was deploying “significant forces”.

numbering up to five battalions.

Vovchansk, which previously had a population of 2,500 but now has only 200-300 residents, suffered “massive shelling” on Sunday that hit houses and wounded seven, said Synegubov.

A 69-year-old man was also wounded in the town of Izyum by detonating ammunition and a woman was injured in a village near the town of Kupiansk.

The city of Kharkiv itself had not been struck over the last 24 hours, however, he said.

Synegubov said on national television that “the grey zone and the front line are expanding” because Russia is “trying to deliberately stretch it, attacking in small groups in new directions”.

The DeepState Telegram channel, which is close to the Ukrainian army, wrote that Russia had taken pockets of territory measuring around 100 square kilometres (39 square miles).

Russia “continues to advance to Vovchansk”, the channel said.

“They are gaining foothold on the outskirts for further entry into the town.”

Russia was also advancing towards the border village of Lyptsi and attempting to enter the nearby village of Glyboke, it said.

Ukraine was mounting “constant fire”, including from drones, “but unfortunately it does not stop them”.

The Russian defence ministry said troops had repelled Ukrainian counterattacks near Glyboke.

Rybar, a Russian Telegram channel with military links, said Moscow’s offensive led to territorial gains because troops took some villages where Russian soldiers already had a presence and others that were “deserted wastelands”.

As of Monday morning, there were no “large-scale breakthroughs of the enemy’s defences”, Rybar said.

14,EN_UA_026142.txt,"Oppose imperialist War! SEP/IYSSE public meeting in Sri Lanka 

 The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) and the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) in Sri Lanka are holding an online meeting entitled “Oppose imperialist war!” on Thursday, May 23, at 7pm.

In announcing the recent International May Day Rally, David North, chairman of the International Editorial Board of the World Socialist Web Site, warned, “A third world war is not a distant possibility. The opening stages of this war are already underway.”

Israel’s genocide in Gaza against Palestinians and its US-backed attacks against Iran are just one front in a rapidly emerging world war involving nuclear armed powers. US imperialism and its allies are already engaged in a war against Russia in Ukraine and are making advanced preparations for a catastrophic conflict with China.

The imperialist leaders as well as various media pundits now casually refer to a nuclear war as an acceptable strategic option, despite the grave threat it poses to the existence of humanity.

The Biden administration, along with other NATO powers, have repeatedly crossed the “red lines” in Ukraine which they previously accepted as necessary to prevent nuclear war.

One might consider that the imperialist leaders—Biden, Sunak, Macron and Scholz—are criminally insane as they drag the planet towards nuclear conflagration. However, their policies are not simply the product of deranged individuals but of the profound crisis of world capitalism for which they have no rational, progressive solution and see a global war for domination as the only way out.

War is being accompanied by savage repression against any opposition as the terrible, continued persecution of Julian Assange for exposing the crimes of US imperialism graphically demonstrates.

Our comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk of the Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninists has been detained by the fascistic Zelensky government in Ukraine earlier this month on false accusations of being a Russian agent. Bogdan has courageously opposed the war in Ukraine, along with his comrades in Russia, denounced both the Ukrainian and Russian regimes and fought for the unity of the Ukrainian and Russian working class.

In the US and other imperialist countries, brutal police crackdowns are taking place against protesters opposing the Gaza genocide with thousands of arrests including of students.

The ongoing anti-war protests in universities and cities are significant, but on their own are incapable of halting the bloodbath. For seven months, the Zionist regime and its imperialist backers have not only ignored protests by millions around the world, but they are also turning to police repression.

The only social force capable of halting the drive to world war is the international working class which is coming into struggle in Sri Lanka and around the world in opposition to the austerity program of the ruling classes. As governments engage in, support and prepare for war, it is workers who are forced to bear the burden.

A struggle against war requires the building of a unified anti-war movement of the working class based on a socialist program, exposing the futility of protest politics and all the apologists for imperialism. Appeals to capitalist governments are bankrupt. The independent mobilisation of workers on this basis needs to take up the fight to free Assange and Syrotiuk as well.

The burning need is for a new revolutionary leadership in the working class based on socialist internationalism to abolish the source of militarism, austerity, authoritarianism and all sorts of social misery—the capitalist system.

The Minister of Education, Prof Tahir Mamman said this at the 2023/2024 Pre-departure briefing of Bilateral Education Agreement Scholars to Russia in Abuja on Tuesday. The first batch of students are already on their way to the airport for departure, while the second and third batches would depart on November 15 and November 17 respectively.

Represented by the Director of Universities Education in the ministry, Rakiya Ilyasu, Mamman advised the scholars not to see the opportunity as uncontrolled freedom to do things that would be to their disgrace.

He explained that the country had invested a lot in them and as such required the returns of investment on their return to the country.

“Note that you are few out of thousands who secured this opportunity which you must not take for granted. Your parents and teachers would also be happy with your succor.

“Your selection is part of a broader plan which ensures that brilliant Nigerians, especially those that cannot afford to study programmes that are not readily available in Nigeria, are supported to get necessary knowledge, skills and competence that would be useful in Nigeria’s development agenda.

“I am happy to inform you that in spite of the global economic meltdown, the number of our development partners have increased and many of them now offer scholarship to Nigeria.

“As you prepare to travel out, ensure to uphold and eschew good values, focus on your studies and be a good ambassador of your country,” he said.

The Minister also charged the scholars to always strive to abide by the laws of their host country and as well remember to be their brother’s keeper in their new environment.

“Most importantly, you need to make your presence known to the Nigerian Embassy in Moscow. This is very necessary based on our experiences from Ukraine.

“Your parents are also spending a lot of resources on you. Note that we all expert you return to our dear country at the end of your studies to assist Nigeria to become a better place by contributing your quota to its development, using your new knowledge and skills,” he added.

Also speaking, the Director, Federal Scholarship Board, Asta Ndajiwo said the journey began in November 2022 with applications from thousands of Nigerians which later translated to the nomination of the candidates. Ndajiwo commended the Federal Government efforts especially in the payment of the scholars allowances from September to December.

She also advised the scholars to do away with any extracurricular activities that could take their lives, recalling an incident with previous two scholars who lost their lives while swimming in a pool.

16,EN_UA_103667.txt,"Desperation and Diplomacy: North Korea's Tech Hunt in Russia Amid Sanctions 

 For several decades, North Korea has masterfully balanced its relations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia, maintaining a relationship with the latter that is both complex and ever-changing.

The dynamics have shifted notably since Russia found itself sanctioned and isolated by the international community following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Since then, North Korea and Russia have grown increasingly close, as recently seen when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited eastern Russia, where he held a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.

After a six-day visit, Mr. Kim returned to Pyongyang on Sunday.

Sanctioned by the international community, North Korea desperately needs Russian technology for nuclear weapons, satellite development, and food production.

Similarly, Russia, also facing sanctions, urgently seeks to replenish its dwindling front-line supplies with large quantities of ammunition from North Korea.

Before the summit, when asked whether Russia would assist North Korea in developing artificial satellites, Mr. Putin confirmed this was a primary reason for their meeting.

Both sides appear willing to overlook the threat of escalated international sanctions against them.

During their summit, Mr. Kim vowed to “fully and unconditionally support” Moscow.

Rocket technology holds particular interest for Mr. Kim and his regime.

From Outward Support to Clandestine CyberattacksAccording to reports, North Korea has long eyed Russian technology, resorting to cyber theft to obtain it, and it is something that Moscow now appears ready to overlook despite recent reports such as one by Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC).

The MTAC report indicates that between March last year and this March, North Korean cyber operatives launched attacks on Russian aerospace research facilities and penetrated academic institutions engaged in research. Additionally, the operatives sent phishing emails to personnel within Russian diplomatic agencies.

The study further revealed that the countries most frequently targeted by North Korean cyberattacks during the same period included South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Russia.

The hacking groups, identified as ScarCruft and Lazarus, covertly installed digital backdoors within the company’s systems to exfiltrate sensitive information. While the full extent of the hackers’ achievements remains unclear, North Korea announced significant advancements in its ballistic missile program mere months after the cyber-attacks were initiated.

SPUTNIX, a private enterprise affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Space Research Institute, lost a substantial amount of information to these cyber incursions. The report speculates that North Korea may have stolen critical technology related to the design of ultra-small satellite bodies.

Experts suggest North Korea’s successful launches of rockets equipped with reconnaissance satellites this year likely capitalized on its prior hacking exploits. These cyber activities appear crucial in advancing the country’s space technology.

Additionally, the report disclosed that in 2020, North Korean hackers penetrated the internal network of Russia’s Almaz-Antey, a leading manufacturer of surface-to-air missiles. The intruders pilfered various information, including developer personal data and proprietary details on missile components.

In 2019, North Korean cyber operatives also exfiltrated design blueprints from Russia’s Uralvagonzavod tank factory, the entity responsible for producing Russia’s next-generation T-14 Armata battle tank.

Moreover, the report highlighted the frequency of North Korean cyber-attacks against Russian defense corporations specializing in avant-garde weapon systems like hypersonic technologies and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

Military commentator Xia Loshan told The Epoch Times on Sept. 10 that both North Korea and Russia are in a desperate situation.

“While North Korea is eager to acquire military technology, the ultimate decision is not in their hands,” Mr. Xia stated, emphasizing that the alliance is precarious and likely unsustainable in the face of stringent international sanctions.

Independent analyst Zhuge Mingyang also weighed in.

“In a relationship marked more by utilitarian needs than genuine alliance, both nations recognize the other’s motivations,” he told The Epoch Times.

“Moscow likely knows full well that Pyongyang is siphoning off its military technology but seems willing to turn a blind eye in exchange for much-needed ammunition—a clear example of a ‘friendship’ based on mutual expediency.”",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Glaciers Give the Lie to Global Warming Narrative

According to the Gospel of the Global Warming Hoax, 1850–1910 was the coldest period of the past millennium. Yet glaciers were retreating rapidly. Now that the planet allegedly has a fever, the retreat has slowed dramatically and even reversed:

Our moonbat rulers canceled the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age for failing to comply with climate ideology. But preventing glaciers from growing is more difficult than doctoring the historical record to support climate con man Michael Mann’s spurious hockey stick graph.

Bishen said that he has been working on sustainability and resilience in healthcare for a long time and that we need to prepare the healthcare system for the “looming crisis of climate change.”

He said that this can be achieved through disease surveillance. “How do we make sure that we have a good global data system that can be accessed quickly so that the private sector can come up with countermeasures whether it be vaccines, diagnostics or therapeutics?” he asked.

19,EN_UA_000568.txt,"Russia Responds to UK’s ‘Very Dangerous’ Coup Allegations 

 Russia’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday dismissed claims from the United Kingdom that Moscow wanted to install a pro-Russia leader in Kyiv while it considers whether to invade the beleaguered Eastern European nation.

The UK further suggested that the Kremlin currently is “maintain[ing] links with” former officials including Serhiy Arbuzov, a former deputy prime minister of Ukraine between 2012 to 2014; Andriy Kluyev, first deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2012; former deputy chief of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council Vladimir Sivkovich; and Mykola Azarov, the prime minister of Ukraine from 2010 to 2014.

What’s more, the UK statement alleges that former Ukrainian Parliament Member Yevhen Murayev “is being considered” by Russia’s leadership “as a potential candidate” to lead the Ukrainian government.

The UK did not provide evidence for its claim. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss asserted, however, that Moscow must deescalate tensions and “end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy.”

But over the weekend, Russian officials said the UK’s Foreign Office should stop publishing “nonsense” and “disinformation.”

The embassy further alleged that the UK’s strategy is to accuse “Russia of plotting ‘inevitable’ invasion of Ukraine and try to play the role of an ideological leader, defending itself from ‘autocrats’ and aiming to ‘free the world.’”

Murayev, meanwhile, responded to the UK’s statement by dismissing the claim.

In a message to Reuters, Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian adviser to the presidential office, said the allegations should be taken seriously, acknowledged there was doubt among Ukrainians as to whether Murayev was “too ridiculous a figure” to be the Kremlin’s pick to lead Ukraine. But he added that Russia had propped up previously minor figures in leadership positions in annexed Crimea and separatist-held Donbass.

Therefore “one should take this information as seriously as possible,” he said.

On Saturday, U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne appeared to endorse the UK assessment that the Kremlin is plotting to install a Moscow-friendly puppet administration.

“This kind of plotting is deeply concerning,” Horne said. “The Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically-elected partners in Ukraine.”",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
20,EN_CC_100044.txt,"The bottom-up Brussels green revolution 

 A Belgian region’s environmental and social conditions for research funding offer a possible model for the EU.

By Anthony King

In the EU and Belgian capital Brussels, Barbara Trachte reflects the strengths of a third governmental layer in Europe: its numerous regions.

Trachte is secretary of state of the Brussels-Capital Region responsible for the economic transition and scientific research. The first member of Belgium’s French-speaking Green party to be put in charge of an economic portfolio, she shows the scope for bottom-up EU policy changes.

Setting an example

Trachte helped put in place a Brussels law that, starting in 2024, has made regional subsidies for research organisations, companies, public administrations and civil society conditional on respect for social and environmental standards. She believes the EU should do the same for its €95.5 billion research programme known as Horizon Europe.

‘Sometimes you need a revolution – or at least a mini revolution,’ Trachte told Horizon Magazine.

She said that Europe’s regions have a key role to play in advancing the continent’s transition to a net-zero economy.

With the EU seeking to become climate neutral by 2050 under the European Green Deal, Horizon Europe has placed increasing emphasis on projects to hasten the switch towards clean energy and away from fossil fuels and to ensure the process is socially fair.

Already the third-biggest part of the EU budget, Horizon Europe would have even greater impact on green and social matters across the continent by following the example set by the Brussels-Capital Region.

In a nutshell, €50 million of subsidies granted annually by the region for research and innovation require recipients to respect a do-no-harm principle and have a positive impact on the environment or social equality, according to Stephanie Lepczynski, who is Trachte’s policy adviser.

‘We are showing the way and we hope that this can influence the European Commission by encouraging it to put environmental, social and governance criteria into the eligibility of Horizon projects,’ Lepczynski said at the European Research and Innovation Days event in Brussels on 20-21 March 2024.

Secrets to success

Gender and transborder-cooperation requirements currently in place for EU funding help ensure greater diversity in research teams and produce scientific results that better reflect the make-up of society, according to Lepczynski.

She said that social and environmental conditionality in Horizon Europe would force researchers systematically to check that they’re acting for the common good and help ensure that funding advances EU green and social goals.

Trachte said such conditions will also be merited in the successor programme of Horizon Europe, which runs for seven years through 2027.

‘I wish for the next EU framework programme to decide the same – to have a greater impact and make a bigger contribution to the objectives of the European Green Deal,’ she said.

For Trachte, EU projects can have the most impact where academic, industry, government, civil society and the environment interact.

This is known as the “quintuple helix” approach to innovation. It has led governments increasingly to prioritise public involvement in innovation processes.

‘This ensures that research is rooted in society and geared towards finding solutions to today’s major societal challenges such as climate degradation, growing socio-economic inequalities or democracies,’ Trachte said.

Mission driven

She singled out as particularly important the five Horizon Europe “Missions”: adapting to climate change, fighting cancer, restoring oceans, cleaning up soil and establishing 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030.

‘The five Missions are a very innovative tool to make the societal challenges stand out – in particular the triple crisis of climate, biodiversity and pollution and the health challenges related to it,’ Trachte said.

In Brussels, the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission was notably successful in bringing together regional and local administrations as well as other partners from the private sector.

‘The enthusiasm created behind the Missions has mobilised many different actors,’ Trachte said.

The views of the interviewees don’t necessarily reflect those of the European Commission.

 by Mac Slavo, SHTF Plan:

Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned that if the United Kingdom signs an imminent deal with Ukraine to put troops in the country, Moscow would consider it as a declaration of war. Medvedev was reacting to the imminent signing of a security agreement between London and Kiev.

Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, issued his warning in a social media post.

A visit to Kiev on Friday by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is set to sign a security agreement with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, would ensure British troops would be openly deployed to Ukraine.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Sunak’s arrival in the Ukrainian capital is meant to “set out a major new package of support and reaffirm the close UK-Ukraine partnership,” his office said in a statement. The security document is a follow-up to agreements reached by G7 and NATO members last year, it noted. The statement did not mention any plans for a British military deployment in Ukraine, however, it could be implied.

“[The deal] formalizes a range of support the UK has been and will continue to provide for Ukraine’s security, including intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training, and defense industrial cooperation,” Downing Street said, according to a report by RT.

The British government has pledged £2.5 billion ($3.2 billion) in military aid to Ukraine over the next two years, including in the form of thousands of military drones, which London said will be the largest of their kind ever received by Kiev. Most of the UAVs will be made in the UK, the announcement added. –RT

Moscow has repeatedly accused the UK (and the United States) of helping Ukraine organize attacks against Russia, particularly in the Black Sea. The Russian Defense Ministry has claimed that British military personnel already have a presence in Ukraine.

24,EN_UA_102034.txt,"Most Taiwanese do not view US as ‘trustworthy’, but majority trusts its security commitment for island: Survey 

 A majority of Taiwanese do not consider the United States a “trustworthy” country, despite expressing belief in Washington’s security commitment to the island, according to a recent survey conducted by National Chengchi University in Taipei.

According to South China Morning Post, the annual survey, which polled 1,211 Taiwanese adults in September, found that only 34 per cent agreed that the US is trustworthy, maintaining the same level as the previous year when it fell from 43.4 per cent in 2021.

Yet as American credibility remained stable, more than 50 per cent did not deem the US “trustworthy” in the survey of 1,211 Taiwanese adults conducted in September, although China fared significantly worse.

Analysts attribute this skepticism to the unfolding events in Ukraine and how the US government responded to Russia’s invasion.

“We suspect that the drop may have come from the occurrence of the Ukraine war and how the United States government responded,” South China Morning Post quoted Hsin-Hsin Pan, a member of the survey team at Taipei’s Soochow University, as saying.

“Washington’s handling of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine indicates to many Taiwanese how the US might respond if Beijing were to engage in armed conflict with the island,” Pan added.

Despite the mixed views on the US, perceptions of China were consistently negative.

Only 9.3 per cent of respondents considered China “trustworthy,” a slight decrease from last year’s 9.4 per cent and 13.5 per cent in 2021. China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has asserted its intention to reunite it with the mainland, even if force is necessary.

While the US does not officially recognise Taiwan as an independent country and adheres to a one-China policy, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 legally binds Washington to “provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character” and maintain the capacity to resist any form of coercion.

President Joe Biden has reiterated the US commitment to intervene militarily should China use force against Taiwan.

The survey also indicated strong support for American arms sales to Taiwan, with over 65 per cent of respondents expressing approval. Approximately 57 per cent believed that the US would use force to assist Taiwan if Beijing attempted to unilaterally change the status quo.

The findings highlight a notable gap between the overall credibility of the US and the credibility of its security commitment to Taiwan. Analysts emphasise that more people are willing to assign credibility to the US security commitment to Taiwan than to the US overall.

Regarding the question of whether Taiwan and China belong to the same country, about 78 per cent of those polled rejected this idea.

Notably, more than 50 per cent of Kuomintang party members or supporters, who generally favor closer ties with Beijing, also asserted that Taiwan and China are not part of the same country. This suggests a disconnect between the KMT party stance and the beliefs of its support base.

As Taiwan approaches its presidential election scheduled for January 13, the political landscape is becoming increasingly complex.

The election is expected to focus on local health and welfare issues, as well as relations with Beijing and the island’s sovereignty.

With regional tensions rising, the outcome of the election is seen as a potential turning point for the island’s future relations with China and the United States. The winning party will play a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of these relationships amidst evolving geopolitical challenges.

 BRAZZAVILLE, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President William Ruto said on Saturday that Kenya will lift visa requirements for all Africans by the end of 2023 with the aim of boosting trade with African countries.

""By the end of this year, no African will need a visa to enter Kenya. The time has come to understand the importance of doing trade between us,"" said Ruto, while speaking at the summit of the world's three major forest basins, namely the Amazon, Congo, and Borneo-Mekong Forest Basins, in Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of the Congo.

Ruto noted the low rate of intra-African trade and urged to reduce customs tariffs within the African continent to accelerate the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area.

""It is time we realize the importance of trading among ourselves and allowing goods, services, people and ideas to move freely across the continent,"" he said, adding that trade among East African Community countries had grown significantly due to the removal of visa requirements and tariffs.

Ruto said that acknowledging and providing incentives to countries in tropical forest basins for forest protection is a smart climate action.

The Amazon basin in South America, the Congo basin in Central Africa, and the Borneo-Mekong basin in Southeast Asia collectively constitute 80 percent of the world's rainforests and contain approximately two-thirds of its biodiversity.

 West silences activists at home while promoting rights abroad – report

Democratic governments suppress protests at home but preach human rights abroad, Climate Rights International has said

Rich democratic nations are deploying harsh measures against climate change activists, while criticizing states in the Global South for similar actions, according to a report by Climate Rights International.

The report highlights the increasingly “heavy-handed treatment” of eco activists in Australia, Germany, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, the UK, and the US, emphasizing that authorities in those nations are violating their legal commitments to protect basic human rights.

According to the study, the drastic steps taken by governments in nations perceived as democratic include lengthy prison terms, preventive detention, and intimidation and harassment online and in the media.

The 70-page report entitled “On Thin Ice: Disproportionate Responses to Climate Change Protesters in Democratic Countries” also highlights how such governments criticize authorities in developing nations for not respecting the right to peaceful protest.

“Governments too often take such a strong and principled view about the right to peaceful protest in other countries – but when they don’t like certain kinds of protests at home they pass laws and deploy the police to stop them,” the executive director of Climate Rights International, Brad Adams, told The Guardian.

Judicial authorities in several countries including the UK, Germany and the US have been imposing “record-breaking” sentences for “non-violent protest,” the report said, emphasizing that some national and state governments are using preemptive arrests and detention of those suspected of planning rallies.

Governments in Western states are also adopting new laws to make the vast majority of protests illegal, and allowing more severe penalties for demonstrators, the report noted.

The researchers accused Western authorities of undermining the right to a fair trial by taking legal steps to stop juries from hearing about people’s motives for taking part in protests during court hearings.

In one UK case in July, five Just Stop Oil protesters were convicted of conspiracy to cause public nuisance by blocking a highway, and were handed the longest-ever sentences for a nonviolent protest. One of the group received a five-year sentence, while four others received four-year terms.",1,['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities'],['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27,EN_CC_100069.txt,"U.K. Backs $1 Trillion Climate ‘Reparations’ I... 

 What fresh nonsense is this? Climate ‘reparations’ are coming, to compensate other countries for the ‘extreme weather’ they’ve been experiencing, which is allegedly our fault, because a model which has always been wrong said so. The U.K. has now backed the transparent scam. The Telegraph has more.

Britain has opened the door to paying climate change reparations to developing countries by supporting talks on the issue at the COP27 summit.

On Sunday, at the meeting in Egypt, U.K. negotiators backed a last-minute agreement to address “loss and damage” payments to countries badly affected by climate-related disasters.

Rishi Sunak will appear at the conference in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday, where he will pledge £65.5 million for green technology in developing countries.

The Prime Minister will say: “By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. And we can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future. That’s a legacy we could be proud of.”

Boris Johnson will also deliver a speech warning against the “naysayers” who threaten Net Zero targets.

Pakistan is leading a push by developing countries including Bangladesh and the Maldives for compensation from richer countries responsible for most of the world’s pollution.

The U.K. backed the issue being on the COP27 agenda during two days of negotiations ahead of the Egypt summit and is understood to accept that a deal must be done over the economic cost of climate change, which is forecast to reach $1 trillion by 2050.

On Sunday night, a Downing Street source said Mr Sunak planned to “scale up progress and support” for developing countries suffering the worst effects of global warming.

The Prime Minister will come under pressure in Egypt to agree to a costly deal on reparations at the same time as he draws up plans for sweeping domestic tax rises and spending cuts.

On Sunday night, Treasury sources said Jeremy Hunt had signed off up to £35 billion in spending cuts and up to £25 billion in tax hikes to fill an estimated financial black hole of £60 billion.

Labour has backed calls for the U.K. to pay other countries affected by climate change, with Ed Miliband, the shadow climate minister, calling it a “moral responsibility”.

 Putin Says West Prepared To Scapegoat Zelensky For War Failures: 'Replaced By Next Year'

Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam, where he signed at least a dozen energy and trade deals with the country's President To Lam, on his tour to shore up ties in Asia in an effort to offset the West's drive to isolate Moscow.

On his last day in the country he made some wide-ranging remarks to the press, and among the most interesting was a statement on the future of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Putin predicted at a moment things are going very badly for Ukrainian forces, and at a rare time Western media seems to be turning on Zelensky, that the Ukrainian leader will soon be replaced over his poor and unpopular decision-making. Putin suggested Washington is essentially going to make him a scapegoat.

""In the West, they simply do not want to replace him [Zelenskyy], the time is not right. I think it's obvious to anyone. They will blame all unpopular decisions on him, including lowering the [military] draft age, and that's it,"" Putin asserted, according to Russian media translation.

That's when he followed with: ""And then they'll replace him. I think it will happen sometime in the first half of next year.""

Putin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets, from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal. Indeed Zelensky's 'celebrity power' on display throughout the first part of the war, where it seemed he could simply do no wrong in the media's eyes, is waning fast.

More importantly, there are signs of large-scale dissent among the Ukrainian population as recruitment officers violently grab men from off the streets.

Despite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late, Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating. He has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power. Putin commented on this while in Vietnam:

Talks on Ukraine could take place as early as tomorrow, but Russia will use the current situation as a starting point, the president added.

""We have been conducting these behind-the-scenes talks, and what we hoped for has failed,"" Putin told reporters.

Zelensky's advisor, Alexey Arestovich, argued in 2019:— Glenn Diesen (@Glenn_Diesen) April 9, 2024

 ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Friday that his country will learn from China's experience to eradicate poverty and enhance exports to increase foreign exchange reserves, the Prime Minister's Office said.

In a meeting held in his office, Sharif said that China's success in lifting more than 700 million people out of poverty serves as a role model for Pakistan, the office said in a statement.

He added that Pakistan wants to benefit from China's experiences in increasing exports which will act as a major step to increase foreign exchange reserves and decrease poverty.

""Pakistan and China share longstanding and deep brotherly relations which are strengthening over time,"" he said, adding that China has always helped Pakistan in difficult times, for which he, along with the entire nation, is grateful to the Chinese leadership and people.

The prime minister encouraged Chinese companies to set up industries in Special Economic Zones being established under the framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Launched in 2013, CPEC, a flagship project of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, is a corridor linking Gwadar Port in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province with Kashgar in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which highlights energy, transport and industrial cooperation.

The prime minister said thorough preparations are being made for CPEC's new phase and its successful initiation will further strengthen economic relations between Pakistan and China.

The prime minister emphasized that Pakistan, being an agricultural country, is committed to adopting the modern techniques and technology of China in agriculture to increase productivity.

He also invited Chinese companies to set up plants for electric and hybrid vehicles in Pakistan to help the country achieve the goal of shifting to electric vehicles in the transportation sector to mitigate the impacts of climate change. ■",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Business Finland is hosting an unprecedented visit by a large delegation from the North American forest and wood products industry, marking a significant milestone in international collaboration. Over 60 delegates from nine U.S. states and Nova Scotia, Canada, are touring Finland to gain insights into the country's advanced forestry practices and innovative wood-based technologies.

For five days, the delegates will visit various Finnish industrial plants, research institutions, and universities.

They will explore forestry management, wood construction, and logging practices across southern, central, western, and eastern Finland. The aim is to familiarize the North Americans with Finland's forest expertise, sustainable forest policies, carbon reduction strategies, and the diverse operations of the Finnish forest industry.

Ulla Lainio, Senior Advisor at Business Finland Washington D.C., stated, ""The large group is touring industrial and forest sites to share knowledge about forestry, forest management, wood building, and logging. This visit reflects the significant interest in Finland's forest innovations.""

The delegates are particularly interested in Finland's manufacturers of forest machines and wood construction equipment, as well as new bio-products such as wood-textile fibers, wood-based building materials, and biofuels. The goal is to foster collaboration in smart forestry, forest health, wood construction, and biomass sectors.

The U.S. forest industry has traditionally been underutilized due to cheap fossil energy and abundant hydropower. However, with the Biden administration's renewed focus on combating climate change, there is a growing interest in biofuels, biomass utilization, forest fire prevention, and advanced forest management technologies. The Inflation Reduction Act provides grants and tax incentives for the forestry sector, making this an opportune time for international collaboration.

Wooden house building is common in North America, with a high demand for suppliers of wood construction equipment, prefabricated house solutions, and CLT (Cross-Laminated Timber) and LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) production lines. The delegation aims to find efficient construction solutions to address housing shortages and achieve carbon neutrality.

Finland, along with Sweden, is a global leader in the forest bioeconomy. The North American delegation seeks partners in both industry and research to support the renewal and diversification of the forestry sector.

Outi Suomi, Circular Transition for Zero Waste Mission Lead at Business Finland, emphasized, ""The forest policy is now favorable for reforms, and there is unprecedented interest towards Finland. The collaboration and mutual business opportunities for Finland's and North America's forest industries are significant.""

During their stay, the delegation will visit notable companies and research institutions, including Koskisen, Veisto, VTT, Pinomatic, UPM, Stora Enso, Metsä Group, Ponsse, University of Eastern Finland, John Deere, Business Joensuu, Natural Resources Institute Finland, Kira Hub, and Aalto University. They will also meet with over 25 forest sector companies showcasing innovative wood-based products, advanced wood construction techniques, and forest fire prevention solutions.

The delegation includes top officials responsible for forest use from Michigan, Minnesota, Washington, Colorado, Arkansas, California, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, and Nova Scotia, as well as representatives from leading research universities, sawmills, major forestry companies, forest owners, logging companies, wood architecture firms, and investors.

This historic visit is expected to pave the way for significant collaborations and advancements in the global forest industry, highlighting Finland's pivotal role in sustainable forestry and wood innovation.

31,EN_CC_200013.txt,"Biden Unveils Strict Auto Standards to Speed EV Shift 

 President Joe Biden's administration announced Wednesday revised pollution standards for cars and trucks meant to accelerate the US auto industry's shift to electric to mitigate climate change.

The rules set ambitious emission reductions for 2032 but are moderated somewhat compared with preliminary standards unveiled last April. Following carmaker criticism, the final rules give manufacturers greater flexibility and ease the benchmarks in the first three years.

Those shifts were criticized as a sop to corporations from at least one environmental group, even as the final rule won praise from other leading NGOs focused on climate change.

The final rules -- which were described by administration official as ""the strongest ever"" and would likely be undone if Republican Donald Trump defeats Biden in November -- still require a nearly 50 percent drop in fleet-wide emissions in 2032 compared with 2026 through increased sales of electric vehicles (EVs) and low-emission autos.

The rules, which dovetail with other key Biden programs to build more EV charging stations and manufacturing facilities and incentivize EV sales, establish the environment as a significant point of difference in the 2024 presidential election.

Trump has mocked climate change as a problem and cast the transition to EVs as a job-killer that will benefit China at the expense of American workers.

Biden argues that US auto builders need to take the lead in the expanding EV market.

""I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers,"" said Biden in a statement. ""Together, we've made historic progress.""

Alluding to his target set three years ago that 50 percent of new vehicles in 2030 would be EVs, Biden predicted we'll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.""

- Industry given more time -

EVs accounted for 7.6 percent in 2023 sales, up from 5.9 percent in 2022, according to Cox Automotive.

The original proposal had envisioned the EV share surging to as much as 67 percent of new vehicle sales by 2032.

Carmakers, which are midway through sweeping, multi-billion-dollar investments to build more EV capacity, criticized the initial standards as overly-stringent. They cited the limited state of charging capacity in the United States that has dampened consumer demand, as well as difficulties in supply of metals and other raw materials for EV batteries.

Following input from the auto industry, organized labor and auto dealerships, Biden administration officials decided to allow manufacturers a ""variety of pathways"" to reaching the standard, a senior Biden administration official said Tuesday.

This path could include a mix of EVs, conventional but more fuel-efficient engines, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which have seen a rise in demand of late.

Biden administration officials opted to soften year-to-year emissions improvements in the 2027-2030 period, while maintaining the same target in 2032.

Moderating the targets in these first three years ""was the right call,"" said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a Washington lobby representing carmakers.

""These adjusted EV targets -– still a stretch goal –- should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up,"" said Bozzella, adding that the extra time will allow more EV charging stations to come on-line.

- Too many 'loopholes'? -

The final standards set a fleet-wide target of 85 grams of carbon dioxide in 2032, down from 170 in 2027, according to an administration fact sheet.

Wednesday's initiative won praise from leading environmental groups including the Sierra Club and NRDC, which said the new rules ""take us in the right direction,"" according to a statement from NRDC chief Manish Bapna.

But Dan Becker, director of the climate transport campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, slammed the adjusted rules as ""significantly weaker.""

""The EPA caved to pressure from Big Auto, Big Oil and car dealers and riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150 through,"" Becker said.

""The weaker rule means cars and pickups spew more pollution, oil companies keep socking consumers at the pump, and automakers keep wielding well-practiced delay tactics.""",1,"['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy']",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Nato in talks to deploy more nuclear weapons amid the growing threat posed by Russia and China - as top Ukrainian security chief warns Putin could firebomb Kyiv with tactical nukes if facing a 'catastrophic defeat'

Nato might deploy more nuclear weapons amid an increasing threat posed by Russia and China, according to the head of the alliance.

Jens Stoltenberg, the 13th secretary general of Nato, revealed there were live discussions among members about removing missiles from storage and putting them on standby to act as a deterrent.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Stoltenberg said: 'I won't go into operational details about how many nuclear warheads should be operational and which should be stored, but we need to consult on these issues. That's exactly what we're doing.'

It comes as the head of Kyiv's national security council said Putin could demand a tactical nuclear weapon be used if Russia's army is beaten in Ukraine.

Oleksandr Lytvynenko made the comments after G7 leaders warned any use by Russia of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons would be met with 'severe consequences', The Times reported.

Meanwhile, Mr Stoltenberg warned in Brussels of the threat from China, adding that nuclear transparency should form the basis of Nato's nuclear strategy to prepare the alliance for the dangers of the world.

'Nato's aim is, of course, a world without nuclear weapons, but as long as nuclear weapons exist, we will remain a nuclear alliance, because a world where Russia, China and North Korea have nuclear weapons, and Nato does not, is a more dangerous world,' he said.

Mr Stoltenberg claimed that China is heavily investing in modern weaponry, which includes its nuclear arsenal, which the secretary general said would increase to 1,000 possibly by 2030.

He insisted the US and its European allies are modernising their nuclear deterrent as a result of heightened threat from Russia.

'The US is modernising their gravity bombs for the nuclear warheads they have in Europe and European allies are modernising the planes which are going to be dedicated to Nato's nuclear mission,' he said.

It comes as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday accused Russia of not wanting peace, after Putin said he would only accept a ceasefire if Ukraine agreed to halt its NATO ascension plans.

Zelensky made the accusation at the end of a major diplomatic summit in Switzerland, which more than 90 countries attended, making it the largest gathering in support of Ukraine since the start of the invasion.

The conference saw the vast majority of the 90 nations who attended sign a communique in support of Ukraine sovereignty, and also called for Putin to return children stolen during the invasion.",1,"['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33,EN_CC_200007.txt,"These 8 States Plan On Banning Sale Of Gas-Powered Vehicles As Biden EPA Tackles ‘Climate Crisis’ 

 Eight states — California, Rhode Island, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington — and the District of Columbia are now on board with plans to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles within the next decade.

The plans to phase out the vehicles and switch to electric and hybrid vehicles come as the Biden administration continues to pursue its lofty climate goals in a struggling economy. The administration, for example, wants half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 to be zero-emission, despite sputtering EV sales.

All 8 of the states and D.C. have adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, and will have an outright ban on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles after 2035.

California was the first to adopt the rule, aiming to have 35% of new vehicle sales emit zero emissions by 2026, and boosting that goal to 68% by 2030.

According to the California Air Resources Board, the regulation overhauls the state’s “growing zero-emission vehicle market and robust motor vehicle emission control rules and augments them to meet more aggressive tailpipe emissions standards and ramp up to 100% zero-emission vehicles.”

As noted by Money, the states’ plans to ban gas-powered vehicles have generally not required votes from lawmakers, but have been advanced with support from governors and environmental regulators.

The EV market has struggled in recent months, as highlighted by The Daily Wire. Ford, for example, had to cut 1,400 employees from its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, rolled back the planned production number of the electric F-150 Lightnings in half, and slashed $12 billion in EV investments.

President Biden, however, is not slowing down when it comes to targeting the gas-powered vehicle industry. Earlier this month, Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set new eye-popping regulations in an effort to increase the number of electric vehicles on the road.


The new EPA rules set emission standards for vehicles made between 2027 and 2032 and would eliminate more than 7 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, setting off concerns across the nation.

For example, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) railed against the EPA’s move, calling it both “reckless” and “ill-informed.”

“The federal government has no authority and no right to mandate what type of car or truck Americans can purchase for their everyday lives,” the senator said. “This reckless and ill-informed rule will impose what is effectively an EV mandate without ensuring the security of our supply chains from nations like China and without a realistic transition plan that addresses our domestic infrastructure needs.”",1,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other']",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 RUSSIA has snatched nearly 300 children from a Ukrainian city in the past month sending them to military camps to become ""Russian zombies.""

Ruthless child snatchers have abducted a total of 280 kids from the annexed Antratsytiv district in Luhansk, according to a report.

The children were then taken to the Cossack cadet corps in Russia's Kalmykia region.

According to figures from Ukraine's National Resistance Center, Moscow plans to kidnap a total of 500 Ukrainian children by the end of summer.

The report claims that the children are not only abducted but sent to be ""zombified with aggressive propaganda"" by Vladimir Putin's forces.

It is estimated Russia has kidnapped well over 20,000 Ukrainian children since the start of the war, and sent them to be brainwashed and tortured.

A Ukrainian teenager told earlier this month how he was kidnapped from school and shipped off to a hellhole Russian camp.

Vitaliy Vertash, 16, told how he was stuck in a room with four others - and they were only fed soup and buckwheat while facing beatings from the ""camp employees"".

The true horrors of the ""re-education camps"" echo that of Nazi Germany, and have turned countless innocent children into ""Russian Zombies"".

Last year, a Sun investigation revealed Vlad's crony Maria Lvova Belova had headed up an organisation tasked with putting kidnapped Ukrainian children into Russian homes.

Meanwhile, up to 5,000 adults were also kidnapped by Russian forces in besieged Mariupol and sent to work camps in Russia.

Some were forced to wear overlarge Russian military uniforms that could make them a target while others dug mass graves for their fallen comrades in the Russian-held region of Zaporizhzhia.

One man who refused to dig was shot on the spot.

Thousands of Ukrainian civilians are being detained across Russia in centres ranging from brand-new wings in Russian prisons to hellhole basements.

And it is likely Russia is planning to hold much more, in line with Putin's plan of erasing the Ukrainian culture.

And Russia is planning to hold possibly thousands more.

A Russian government document obtained by The Associated Press dating to January outlined plans to create 25 new prison colonies and six other detention centers in occupied Ukraine by 2026.

The Russian dictator signed a decree in May allowing Russia to send people from territories with martial law, which includes all of occupied Ukraine, to those without, such as Russia.

This makes it easier to deport Ukrainians who resist Russian occupation deep into Russia.

Many civilians are picked up for alleged transgressions as minor as speaking Ukrainian or simply being a young man in an occupied region, and are often held without charge.

 by Xinhua writer Shi Hao

BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Over the past three months, Anhui Huasun Energy Co., Ltd. has been racing against time to make solar modules for a gigantic photovoltaic project in China's Xinjiang.

These 1.8-gigawatt modules using advanced heterojunction technology will be installed at a 4-gigawatt solar power plant, which is located on the edge of China's largest desert, the Taklimakan.

""For Chinese companies in the photovoltaic industry more than 20 years ago, raw materials, technologies and markets relied heavily on foreign countries and regions. But now, the tide has totally turned,"" Huasun's chairman Xu Xiaohua said.

In east China's Anhui Province, where Xu's company is based, the photovoltaic industry has snowballed in the past five years. The number of companies in the business with an annual revenue exceeding 10 billion yuan (about 1.43 billion U.S. dollars) rose to 11 in 2023.

The boom, which is also recorded beyond Anhui, is underpinned by China's vigorous efforts to expedite a comprehensive transition to green growth as tasks remain daunting.

China aims to raise the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption to around 25 percent of total energy consumption by 2030, which means the country must make every effort to increase the ratio by one percentage point annually in the next few years.

""The proportion of coal consumption in China's total energy consumption stood at 55.3 percent in 2023, and thus the potential for green and low-carbon energy transition is great,"" said Li Zheng, director of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University.

China is already revving up the transition to green energy. Official data released this week showed that the installed capacity of solar power came in at approximately 750 million kilowatts in the first eight months of 2024, rocketing 48.8 percent year on year, and the installed capacity of wind power grew 19.9 percent to some 470 million kilowatts.

Pan Huimin, deputy head of the National Energy Administration's new and renewable energy department, said the rapid development of the new energy sector in recent years resulted from full market competition, a sound business environment, constant tech innovation and a complete industrial chain.

To meet the requirement of exports and foster green industrial and supply chains, Chinese enterprises' demand for clean electricity is experiencing ""explosive growth,"" Pan said in the latest episode of the China Economic Roundtable, an all-media talk platform hosted by Xinhua. The new episode was broadcast Friday.

A key challenge is fully harnessing unstable wind and sunlight and transmitting power to users, often hundreds or thousands of kilometers away.

Last month, users in Beijing started receiving solar and wind power generated in the northwestern province of Gansu after the energy was delivered via extra-high-voltage transmission lines, benefiting Gansu companies in the business and meeting the Chinese capital's demand for green energy.

China unveiled an action plan last month to speed up building a ""new electricity system."" According to the document, Chinese authorities will use advanced power generation, regulation and control technologies to increase the transmission of clean electricity through the grid.

Local governments and enterprises should seize opportunities and vigorously exploit wind and solar power in line with local resources and with the capabilities of the grid to absorb the generated electricity, Pan said. ■",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 INCREDIBLE footage shows a panicked Russian pilot ejecting from his plane and watching as it crashes in a fireball after being shot down.

The explosion could be seen miles away after the jet was taken down by what is thought to be Ukrainian fire.

The fighter pilot had to release his parachute mid-air and was forced to land in an abandoned field.

The shocking first-person footage is believed to have been recorded in the summer but wasn't released until now.

It shows the Russian fighter pilot release his parachute mid-air after his Su-25SM was taken down by what's believed to have been incoming Ukrainian fire, according to a weapons tracking account on Twitter.

The aircraft nose-dives into the ground, unleashing a hellish explosion that can be seen from miles away while the pilot lands safety in an abandoned field.

It is unclear what happened to the pilot since the recording but some observers claim the flight crashed during a planned training run in Belgorod region, Russia.

It comes as astonishing footage shows the moment a Ukrainian tank opened fire in a vicious battle against Russian forces.

Fierce fighting can be seen in the video as the 46-tonne T-84 main battle tank blasts its 125mm cannon towards Putin's men during the bloody clash that is understood to have occurred near Kherson.

Ukrainian forces are seen engaging nearly point-blank with a Russian convoy who appear to have blundered into them as they drove up a dirt road.

Trucks emblazoned with the ""Z"" symbol can see attempting to rush past the tank - only for soldiers on the ground to then open fire on them.

The bearded gunner in the tank's turret ducks down as gunfire can be heard all around him.

With the snaps of bullets and the boom of tank guns, the convoy - with a truck towing a howitzer and an armoured personnel carrier - grind to a halt.

Other clips released as part of the video package shows the gunner opening fire on unseen foes with his heavy machine gun.

It's believed Mad Vlad would happily sacrifice 20 million soldiers to ensure he won the war in Ukraine and secure his future as Russia's leader, a former insider has claimed.

The chilling warning comes as fears of the war in Ukraine turning nuclear continue to grow as Russia's defence minister said a ""dirty bomb"" could be detonated in Ukraine.

Exiled former diplomat Boris Bondarev warned Putin would sacrifice millions of lives to win in Ukraine.

""He is not smart, he is just lucky. Now I think his luck is over,"" Mr Bondarev told Sky News.

""You should have no doubt about it, he may sacrifice 10 or 20 million Russians just to win this war just to slaughter all Ukrainians because it's a matter of principle.

""It's a matter of political survival to him. You have to understand that, if he loses the war, it will be the end for him.""

Bondarev added: ""After losing the war, he will have to explain to his elites and his population why it is so and he may find some problems in explaining this.

""And after that there may be opposition who will try to depose him or he will try to purge his subordinates to find some people who could be blamed for all these problems.""

Meanwhile, Russian war boss Sergei Shoigu warned that the brutal warzone is risking ""uncontrolled escalation"" as Putin's forces continue to be pushed back across the frontline.

Shoigu suggested that Ukraine could actually be the one to detonate a ""dirty bomb"" - an explosive laced with radioactive material.

And while not a true nuclear weapon, the consequences of using such a device could be catastrophic.

But it has been Russia wildly swinging the nuclear sabre during the war - and the latest allegation could be another diversion tactic.

Putin's forces like to spread as much chaos and misinformation as possible to cover their own tracks.

37,EN_UA_017831.txt,"Pence calls viral clip suggesting he cares more about Ukraine than US ‘fake news’ 

 Former Vice President Mike Pence fired back on social media after an out-of-context video clip of him suggesting he’s more interested in the war in Ukraine than issues plaguing cities across the US went viral on Friday.

In the video, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson questions the 2024 Republican presidential candidate about where his priorities lie after Pence criticizes the length of time it has taken the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with weapons to fend off Russia’s invasion of the former Soviet state.

“You are distressed that the Ukrainians don’t have enough American tanks. Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years. Drive around. There’s not one city that’s gotten better in the United States, and it’s visible,” Carlson says during a forum at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa.

“Our economy has degraded, the suicide rate has jumped, public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased, and yet, your concern is that the Ukrainians – a country most people can’t find out a map – who’ve received tens of billions of US tax dollars don’t have enough tanks. I think it’s a fair question to ask, like, where’s the concern for the United States in that?” Carlson asks Pence.

To which Pence responds, “It’s not my concern. Tucker, I’ve heard that routine from you before, but that’s not my concern.”

Several conservatives on social media seized on the clip, including Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who shared a snippet of the exchange on Twitter and wrote, “Tucker Carlson just brutalized Mike Pence for prioritizing Ukraine despite a litany of social ills afflicting America.”

The former vice president shot back at Kirk on social media, sharing a clip with his full answer to Carlson that showed him explaining that under a Pence administration, the country would be able to tackle both issues affecting Ukraine and domestic problems at the same time.

“Sorry [Charlie Kirk]. That is what we used to call FAKE NEWS. Here’s the full clip of my remarks if you’re interested,” Pence wrote in his tweet.

In the extended clip, Pence continues his response to Carlson by saying, “Anybody that says that we can’t be the leader of the free world and solve our problems at home has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on Earth. We can do both.

“And as president of the United States, we will secure our border, we will support our military, we will revive our economy and stand by our values. And we will also lead the world for freedom under my administration. I promise you.”

Pence made an unannounced visit to Kyiv late last month and became the first declared 2024 Republican contender to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The 64-year-old made the trip with Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian humanitarian organization that the former vice president previously accompanied to Poland and Ukraine, a Pence adviser said.

“I really do believe that if Vladimir Putin and the Russian military were to overrun Ukraine, it wouldn’t be too long before they cross the border where our men and women would be required to fight,” Pence, an outspoken backer of the Ukrainian war effort and providing US military support for the country, told NBC News in June.",1,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Overpraising the West', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A Former Ukrainian MP Blew The Whistle On Burisma's Connections To Terrorism

Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

Former Ukrainian MP Andrey Derkach, who’s reviled by the Biden Administration for sharing dirt about Hunter Biden’s Burisma corruption scandal with Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani ahead of the 2020 elections, just gave a very important interview to Belarus’ BelTA where be blew the whistle even louder. According to him, the $6 million bribe that was paid in cash to shut down the investigation into the First Son’s scandal eventually found its way to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and its military-intelligence agency.

Derkach claimed to have proof of the secret court order that divided these funds between those two, with the first investing its portion into building up their country’s drone army while the second financed terrorist attacks like the assassination of Darya Dugina, which he specifically mentioned in the interview. These allegations expand upon the ones that he shared earlier this year regarding the real-world impact of Hunter’s corruption scandal, which were analyzed here at the time.

On the subject of Ukrainian assassinations and terrorism, Derkach said that the CIA and FBI actually condone these actions despite their public claims to the contrary, but he warned that this immoral policy will inevitably ricochet into the US itself. In particular, he cited FBI chief Christopher Wray’s testimony to Congress last April where he said that law enforcement officials fear that Crocus-like attacks are presently being plotted against their country.

About that, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Ukraine’s military-intelligence service GUR is the chief suspect of Russia’s investigation into what became one of the worst terrorist attacks in its history, thus meaning that the portion of Burisma’s $6 million bribe that made its way into their hands likely financed part of it. In other words, the third-order effect of Hunter’s corruption scandal is that it was partially responsible for the brutal murder of innocent civilians halfway across the world some years later.

That’s already scandalous enough, but Derkach shared even more details about the other indirect consequences of this cover-up into the First Son’s illicit activities, adding that some GUR-linked figures have been connected to the Western narrative about September 2022’s Nord Stream terrorist attack. He regards that story as a distraction from the US’ complicity, the view of which was elaborated upon here at the time that it entered the discourse, but lauded the CIA for the lengths it went to cover up its role.

In his view, the CIA might very well have sent a highly trained Ukrainian diving team to the Baltic Sea exactly as the Western media reported, though only to plant fake bombs. In his words, “when a cover story is made, it is done quite well. We shouldn’t belittle the experience of the CIA or the experience of MI6 in preparing cover operations. They have quite a lot of experience in using proxies, in using cover stories to form a certain position in order to dodge responsibility. This is actually what happened.”

Looking forward, Derkach expects Ukraine to attempt more terrorist attacks against Russia, which the US public is being preconditioned to accept via the CIA’s various leaks to the media. While many might lay the blame for all this on Zelensky’s lap, Derkach believes that it’s actually his Chief of Staff Andrey Yermak who’s running the show, albeit as a Western puppet. Nevertheless, he’s also convinced that the West is indeed preparing to formally replace Zelensky, but doesn’t yet know when or with whom.

Altogether, the importance of Derkach’s interview is that he’s a former veteran Ukrainian politician who still retains a lot of sources inside the regime, having served in the Rada for a whopping 22 years from 1998-2020. While his homeland charged him with treason after he fled to Russia in early 2022, which followed the US charging him with election meddling on behalf of that country in September 2020, the argument can be made that these are politically driven attempts to intimidate a top whistleblower.

The dirt that Derkach shared about Hunter’s Burisma corruption scandal, not to mention its newly revealed third-order effects that led to the brutal killing of civilians halfway across the world after part of his company’s bribe made its way into GUR’s hands, made him an enemy of the US Government. They and their Ukrainian proxies will therefore always try to discredit him with sensational allegations, but everyone would do well to listen to what he says and then make up their own minds about it.",1,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
39,EN_CC_100122.txt,"Your Connection to Nature 

 I grew up in New England, on a bluff overlooking the Connecticut River. We lived in a quiet town with a village green, a local dairy around the corner, and houses lining Main Street that were built in the mid-1700s.

Unlike the deep snows that blanket Vermont in the winter, we lived farther south, in an area known for legendary ice storms. It’s like the weather can’t make up its mind whether to rain or snow, so it rains—then decides to freeze.

When I was in high school, we had the mother of all ice storms. The frozen rain had left almost half an inch of ice on everything from roads and rooftops to the tiniest of twigs. The trees, unable to bear the weight of so much ice, lost branches or were ripped from the ground completely. The branches and felled trees blocked roads and pulled down power lines. We huddled in front of our fireplace, making meals on a camp stove for the better part of a week, without power or heat.

The ice clung stayed for several days. And then one evening, the mercury climbed from below-freezing to 50 degrees in a matter of hours. My dad and I went outdoors to watch the weather change, and because we lived on a hill, we could see what was happening across much of the Connecticut River Valley.

As the thermometer rapidly rose, the tons of ice began falling from the trees and rooftops with a deafening roar. The broken power lines thawed and then lit up the sky with dangerous blue explosions of electricity.

Dad and I watched in wonder as our frozen, ice-caked world thawed. He turned to me and said, “You’ll never forget this night for as long as you live.”

My dad has been gone now for almost two decades, but that evening, his comment, is how I like to remember him. The awe of Mother Nature was unforgettable. But it was also that my dad, a slide-rule-carrying engineer would fearlessly turn to his then-snotty teen-aged daughter and express his amazement and wonder of the world. That’s what I remember most.*

I choose to remember that evening, that moment in time when I think about my dad because it makes me smile. But it was also a profound moment because my father, who was a deeply religious man, was tacitly acknowledging that our connection with nature is also about our relationship with God or the universe or however you define the divine.

The point is that when you stop, observe, and admire the incredible operating system that is nature, how can you be anything but in awe? Nature has the ability to turn a tiny seed into a tree or an ear of corn, just by adding air, water, and sunlight. It keeps the oceans just the right amount of salinity to sustain the lives of fish and other aquatic animals. Our planet provides millions of species of plants, animals, and insects everything they need to survive.

And yet, we get caught up in our lives and often lose touch with nature for long periods of time. Long enough for critical habitat to be turned into parking lots and for rainforests to be cut down. Long enough for our air to become toxic, and for the Colorado River to run empty before it reaches the ocean.

I don’t pretend to have any answers, except for the baby step of reexamining your relationship with the natural world. Stop and listen to the birds, notice how moss looks like a tiny forest, wonder at the tenacity of those plants that grow through the cracks in the sidewalk, and be in awe at how trees know to leaf out in the spring. Be the person who picks up a plastic bag blowing in the wind or who walks to your destination when possible, or who introduces native plants in your yard.

Like that moment in a melting ice storm, it’s the small moments, realizations, and actions that can help in sustaining our planet. Renewing your connection with nature combined with inspired action, multiplied by the billions of people on the planet can make a difference.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 The climate science denying group the Global Warming Policy Foundation has admitted that it shared an “erroneous” temperature dataset to support Lord Lawson’s false claims to the BBC last week that global temperatures aren’t rising.

Three days after Lawson’s BBC interview – which was immediately and widely criticised in the media and by scientists – the climate denial group tweeted out Sunday afternoon that it was “happy to correct the record” and has since removed the tweet after a request to do so by climate scientist Ed Hawkins.

According to the tweets, the graph was originally produced by US meteorologist Ryan Maue, an adjunct scholar of the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute co-founded by Charles Koch. It was published by weather forecaster and climate science denier Joe Bastardi. Both Bastardi and Maue work for WeatherBELL Analytics, a private weather consulting firm.

Screenshot of GWPF tweets taken on August 14 2017.

Thanks for acknowledging this Benny. Are you could to delete the original tweet so that this erroneous claim doesn’t spread further?

— Ed Hawkins (@ed_hawkins) August 13, 2017

Indeed. My bias, my mistake.

— GWPF (@thegwpfcom) August 13, 2017

As a number of climate scientists have been quick to point out, Lawson was wrong to claim that the average global temperature has “slightly declined” since 2007. In fact, the global surface temperature over this period has risen, with the three hottest years on record occurring in 2014, 2015 and 2016.

In addition to being a reaction to those debunking the graph’s false and misleading claims, the GWPF’s efforts to distance themselves from the inaccurate data comes one day after neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer featured a story using the same graph with the headline “It’s Colder Now Than When Al Gore Won the Nobel Prize for Kook Theory in 2007”.

 KREMLIN propagandists have called for London to be “turned to dust” after Ukraine said it would use British missiles.

The deranged ranting was part of a nightly show dedicated to pro-war discussion on state TV that’s hosted by a notorious Putin acolyte.

Last night’s show featured discussion of a report in The Sun saying Kyiv said it would use the Storm Shadow missile if the UK was willing to provide it.

At one point host Vladimir Solovyov bizarrely raised his hand as if to cast a spell, then stared manically at the camera and said: “London will turn to dust! To dust.”

Mad Vlad's mouthpiece, his face twisted with rage, then switches to English and begins shouting: “Burn in hell!” and “Flames!”

Solovyov was responding to a panellist who made a wildly exaggerated claim about a news story published by The Sun.

He fumed: “The British press is saying ‘We’ll give them hell! I’m quoting verbatim from their most popular paper The Sun.

“They all regard this as completely fine - ‘Russians can and need to be killed’. They’re saying that constantly.

“There’s one problem with Russians. They won’t give up as easily as that.”

The clip and its translation was tweeted by BBC Monitoring, which regularly posts on pro-Kremlin propaganda shows.

It comes after Volodymyr Zelensky asked for 600mph British missiles when he visited the UK recently with a shopping list of weapons.

Ukrainian defence sources Kyiv would be prepared to use the missiles to strike Crimea

It followed a warning from Zelensky that longer-range weapons from western allies would allow Ukraine to take the battle to areas occupied by Russian.

""It will allow us to make the evil completely retreat from our country by destroying its airbases deep in the occupied territories,” he said during his visit.

In response, Rishi Sunak said “nothing is off the table” when it comes to military support for Ukraine.

The Government is still weighing up whether to send deadly Harpoon anti-ship missiles or surface-to-air Storm Shadows to arm Ukrainian defenders.

After Germany finally agree to send tanks, Solovyov, and other Kremlin propagandists threatened nuclear strikes on the West.

In a similar rant he claimed it meant Germany had joined the war.

Solovyov said: ""It’s time to send a clear, resolute message that we now consider Germany a direct party to the conflict, rekindling memories of World War Two.

“German tanks appearing [in Ukraine] will definitely mean we consider German territory, military bases and other sites as legitimate targets.”

Raging Moscow TV pundit Yevgeny Satanovsky said warheads should be launched on the German capital Berlin and the country’s parliament, the Bundestag.

“Flat, slightly radioactive, melted-down ground [will remain in its place].”

Ukrainian defenders are bracing for an assault that could include 1,800 tanks, 3,950 armoured vehicles, 400 fighter jets and 300 helicopters incoming from Russia.

 Israel to respond to genocide charges at UN’s top court

Israel will respond to charges of genocide at the United Nations’ top court on Friday after South Africa filed an urgent request with the court to order a ceasefire in Gaza.

It is the third time the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has held hearings on the Israel-Hamas war since South Africa filed proceedings at The Hague court in December.

On Thursday, South Africa told the court the situation in Gaza has reached “a new and horrific stage”, and urged the 15 judges to take urgent action.

Israel must “totally and unconditionally withdraw” from the Gaza Strip, said Vusimuzi Madonsela, South Africa’s ambassador to the Netherlands.

South Africa has submitted four requests for the ICJ to investigate Israel. According to the latest request, the country says Israel’s military incursion in Rafah threatens the “very survival of Palestinians in Gaza”.

During hearings earlier this year, Israel strongly denied committing genocide in Gaza, saying it does all it can to spare civilians and is only targeting Hamas militants. Israel says Rafah is the last stronghold of the militant group.

In January, judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.

The court has already found that there is a “real and imminent risk” to the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israel’s military operations.

“This may well be the last chance for the court to act,” said Irish lawyer Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, who is part of South Africa’s legal team.

ICJ judges have broad powers to order a ceasefire and other measures, though the court does not have its own enforcement apparatus.

A 2022 order by the court demanding that Russia halt its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has so far gone unheeded.

Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced since fighting began.

The war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 in which Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.

Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in its count.

South Africa initiated proceedings in December 2023 and sees the legal campaign as rooted in issues central to its identity. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Blacks to “homelands”. Apartheid ended in 1994.

On Sunday, Egypt announced it plans to join the case. Several countries have also indicated they plan to intervene, but only Libya, Nicaragua and Colombia have filed formal requests to do so.

 WALL Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has had his latest appeal blocked by a judge in Moscow after he was locked up on bogus spy charges.

The 31-year-old American appeared in a glass-walled dock after being brought from the tough jail where he has been held since March.

He lodged an appeal against a Moscow court judge's earlier decision to extend his pretrial detention into late November.

But today, the judge refused to hear the case and instead sent it to a lower court because of ""procedural violations"".

Gershkovich bravely smiled from behind the defendant's glass cage in a yellow jumper and kept his hands in the pockets of his jeans.

US ambassador Lynne Tracy was present at the hearing.

The US journalist was arrested in March 29 on trumped up charges of ""espionage"", which Gershkovich, Washington and The WSJ vehemently deny.

Russian officials have not yet provided any public evidence to back up their allegations.

No date has been officially set for his trial, however Putin's spooks continue to extend his detention - which today reached 174 days.

He will now suffer behind bars in the notorious Lefortovo prison until at least November 30.

Most read in The Sun

The WSJ's Moscow correspondent's pretrial detention was originally supposed to expire on May 29 - but appeals for his release have been repeatedly denied.

This expiration was pushed back to August 30, and was then extended into late November.

He has failed in two previous appeals, in April and June.

Under Moscow's criminal law, the 31-year-old could face a pretrial extension of up to 12 months.

Putin's arrest of Evan has previously been branded internationally as a ""cowardly act"" as the despot desperately tries to escape accountability over his war in Ukraine.

His arrest marked an increasingly ferocious crackdown on media freedom in Russia.

It is the first time Russia has brought a spy case against an overseas journalist since the end of the Cold War, and he faces a jail term of up to 20 years if convicted.

His employers called the arrest ""a vicious affront to a free press"" that ""should spur outrage in all free people and governments throughout the world"".

“No reporter should ever be detained for simply doing their job,"" The Journal added.

Washington has repeatedly stated that charges against Gershkovich are bogus and baseless and has demanded his immediate release.

They have deplored his ""wrongful detention"" as a method of ""hostage diplomacy"" designed to give Russia leverage at the bargaining table at a time when relations between the two countries have plunged to their lowest point in more than 60 years.

US officials said in July that there was still no clear ""pathway"" to getting him home, despite high-level talks.

44,EN_UA_013710.txt,"Operation Babylift and the Hypocrisy of the International Criminal Court 

 by Kurt Nimmo, Kurt Nimmo on Geopolitics:

In the “collective West,” hypocrisy rules the narrative, most recently in regard to the ICC and the “kidnapped” children of Ukraine.

In America, the scurrilous neocon and warmonger propagandist Max Boot weighed in on the meaningless and unenforcible decision to arrest President Putin. Boot’s argument is delusional, but then neocons thrive on lies and delusions.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Propaganda, pure and simple. Boot is an accessory to mass murder, having advocated the invasion of Iraq, the slaughter of over a million Iraqis, and the engineered destruction of their country.

The hypocritical ICC didn’t bother to contrast and compare Putin’s supposed abduction of Ukrainian children to an organized mass kidnapping of Vietnamese children. It was dubbed “Operation Babylift,” ordered by then President Ford, and was conducted at the end of the Vietnam War as the USG evacuated, having lost the war.

The Vietnamese children abducted without permission were described as “orphans,” although many had parents and relatives that were left behind. 3,300 children, described as “infants” (many were older children), were parceled out to families in America, Australia, West Germany, and France.

The “rescue” of these children was an organized act of kidnapping pure and simple, yet in the Land of Amnesia, millions of Americans know nothing about it (or, for that matter, the Vietnam War itself and the brutal destruction of Southeast Asia).

In 1975, a class action suit was filed in San Francisco on behalf of the kidnapped children.

“The suit seeks to enjoin adoption proceedings until it has been ascertained either that the parents or appropriate relatives in Vietnam have consented to their adoption or that these parents or relatives cannot be found,” The Adoption History Project notes. “The Complaint alleged that several of the Vietnamese orphans brought to the United States under Operation Babylift stated they are not orphans and that they wish to return to Vietnam.”

A statement issued on April 4, 1975, by “professors of ethics and religion,” pointed out that many “of the children are not orphans; their parents or relatives may still be alive, although displaced, in Vietnam… The Vietnamese children should be allowed to stay in Vietnam where they belong.”

The operation was celebrated by the corporate media and “Hollywood’s celebrity elite… [and, as a propaganda event] generated a spectacle of celebration and emphasized that the babies were more than just average orphans,” writes US History Scene.

Uncritical acceptance of the Vietnam war orphans did not last long. A variety of American voices that ranged from child psychologists to news reporters to the casual observer soon began asking whether the evacuation served the best interests of the children. This concern followed closely on the heels of criticism over U.S. motivation for the evacuation. Much of this controversy began when the unclear orphan status of some of the children came to light. The government of South Vietnam reluctantly allowed so many children to leave the country only under the condition that those who left would already be in the adoption process. Volunteers processing the children found that not all of them fit into this category of orphan. In the processing centers, some of the children told the volunteers that they were not orphans and had families living back in Vietnam.

Naturally, Operation Babylift is all but forgotten today. It would be counterproductive to the onslaught of USG and ICC propaganda, not directed at the welfare of children, but rather as a crude “informational” device to further turn opinion against Russia’s SMO to denazify and disarm Ukraine and, in addition, prevent NATO from undermining Russian national security.

 Sweden says enough!

Sweden’s Prosecution Authority is bringing charges against none other than their homegrown eco-hoaxer, Greta Thunberg, for disobeying law enforcement during a climate protest in June.

The 20-year-old is facing potential fines or imprisonment of up to six months.

The charges stem from her involvement in a protest that allegedly led to major traffic disruption in Malmö in June, authorities said.

“The prosecutor has filed charges against a young woman who, on June 19 this year, participated in a climate demonstration which, according to the prosecution, caused disruption to traffic in Malmö,” the statement said. The woman “refused to obey the police command to leave the scene,” it added according to CNN.

While the prosecution authority’s statement did not specifically name Thunberg, a spokesperson for the Swedish Prosecution Authority, Annika Collin, confirmed to CNN that the individual referred to in the charges is indeed Greta Thunberg.

“The criminal classification is disobedience to law enforcement. According to the prosecutor, the act was committed with intent,” the prosecution authority’s statement added.

Irma Kjellström, a spokesperson for Ta Tillbaka Framtiden, told CNN that Thunberg was among several young people who participated in blocking the oil tankers.

Kjellström added, “After having blocked the industry which is burning our future, we have now been charged with crime. While charges are being brought against us, the real crime continues inside the gates that we blocked.”

Recently, Greta Thunberg was back in the news after her prediction that the world would end in 2023 was a conspiracy.

On June 21, 2018, she made a bold claim on Twitter, stating that humanity had a narrow five-year window to stop the use of fossil fuels or face inevitable extinction.

“A top climate scientist is warning that climate change will wipe out all of humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years.”

Thunberg shared a now-deleted Grit Post article by Scott Alden citing a prediction from James Anderson, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at Harvard University, titled, “Top Climate Scientist: Humans Will Go Extinct if We Don’t Fix Climate Change by 2023.”",1,['CC: Criticism of climate movement'],['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Paranoid Putin tries to hide ‘cancer battle’ by making bombshell medical files SECRET as weak ruler fears being toppled’

PANICKED Vladimir Putin has dramatically classified bombshell data which appears to prove he has been treated for cancer.

Rumours have persistently swirled that the tyrant, 70, is ""critically ill"" - fuelled by his bloated face and trembling legs.

Bombshell spy documents leaked to The Sun appeared to confirm Putin has pancreatic cancer and early-stage Parkinson's disease.

Now the panicked Russian leader has desperately classified medical files that reveal an apparent cancer battle as he fears a coup inside the Kremlin.

A loophole previously allowed investigative journalists to show that the dictator was constantly accompanied by a top thyroid cancer specialist and other medics.

Revelations last April indicated surgeon Yevgeny Selivanov, of Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital, had flown to Putin no less than 35 times in Black Sea resort Sochi.

More on Putin

The proof of Putin’s treatment by cancer doctors was deduced from the existence of contracts with the hospital which were listed on a Russian public procurement website.

Now such details have been made top secret, preventing public knowledge of current and future contracts.

Earlier it was seen that Putin was accompanied by between six and 13 medical specialists on his trips.

Medics were also seen to be on standby near his favourite official residences outside Moscow, for example in Sochi and Valdai.

Most read in The Sun

The report by Proekt media in April gave credence to rumours that Putin had suffered from cancer.

Medics appeared to be thyroid and ENT specialists.

It comes after it was revealed the Russian government has built a secret network of rail lines that lead to Putin's residences - and train stations nearby.

The blocking of data of such contracts was revealed by Sirena, part of Radio Liberty.

KREMLIN COUP?

The move is likely to increase speculation that the Kremlin is hiding the truth about Putin’s health during the war against Ukraine.

Symptoms of thyroid cancer include the appearance of a thick nodule in the thyroid area; hoarseness of voice; difficulty swallowing; pain in the neck and throat; enlarged lymph nodes in the neck; a dry cough, scratchy or scratchy feeling in the throat or behind the sternum.

There have also been claims that Putin is suffering from abdominal cancer and other ailments.

Meanwhile, there have been suggestions that drugs to treat his cancer may have distorted his mind when he launched the war in Ukraine.

The Kremlin insists that Putin is healthy.

Among the medics named as treating Putin were Dr Dmitry Verbovoy, an expert in acute illnesses, injuries and poisonings.

Another was Dr Konstantin Sim, an orthopaedic traumatologist, possibly helping with ice hockey injuries, ENT doctor Alexei Shcheglov and infectious disease specialist Yaroslav Protasenko.

He was also seen by neurosurgeons from the Central Clinical Hospital, led by department head Oleg Myshkin and Dr Elena Rastrusina, plus a resuscitator

Dr Pavel Sharikov, and head nurse Lyudmila Kadenkova.

A rehabilitation specialist was also involved, Dr Mikhail Tsykunov.In July 2020, Putin met with the head of the National Medical Research Center for Endocrinology, Ivan Dedov.

It comes after the former head of MI6 suggested said there could be a coup inside the Kremlin to oust Putin - but the mechanisms for political change in Russia are ""fragile"".

Sir Richard Dearlove told The Sun: ""I think we're heading into another phase where you're going to get a political upheaval as a result of a war gone badly wrong.

47,EN_CC_100042.txt,"Protest-Driven Change 

 Safeguarding the interests of the wheat growers, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s decision to increase the wheat procurement target demonstrates a positive shift in government policy and reactiveness.

In a powerful example of peaceful and legitimate protest, the farmers’ protest was successful in influencing the policies of the state. The complaints of delays in wheat procurement and the exploitation by flour mills that were offering rates lower than the government-mandated price have been heard and addressed by the state.

The government’s decision not only addresses the grievances of the farmers but also reflects its willingness to listen to the concerns of the citizens and adjust government strategies in a timely manner – something we have been governmentally lacking for quite some time now.

The PM directed the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited to ensure the swift buying of wheat from these farmers. This is the epitome of how citizens can hold the government accountable, reforming the governance policies and driving a positive change in society.

However, the issue of wheat prices is still an issue – one that may not exactly be in the hands of the state. Support prices set by the provincial governments vary, as can be seen in the case of Balochistan and Sindh. Their respective prices are not adjusted to the recent inflation and have been carried on from last year’s wheat prices.

This is further aggravating the concerns of the farmers who are facing a higher cost of production owing to the higher energy and fertilizer costs. Not only does this make it challenging for the farmers to receive fair compensation for their produce, but it also does not take into account the impact of global warming that has further worsened their troubles. Heavier showers this year have adversely affected the harvesting season and crop yields for these farmers, and this needs to be accounted for.

The government’s efforts to address their concerns are a good step, but we need to extend more support to them in these difficult times. If we want to be more proactive in our governance, then considering the long-term implications of climate change on our agriculture will be wise moving forward.

Unpredictable weather patterns and extreme precipitation disproportionately affect our farmers, jeopardizing their sole source of income. As such, the state must stand by vulnerable farming communities and formulate policies to mitigate the impact, ensuring sustainable agricultural development in the nation.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 by Eric Zuesse, The Duran:

First here, are a group of lies that all are false, all for the very same reason — that they all blatantly contradict the actual (as is to be documented here) history (just click onto each given lying phrase below, to see instances in which the given false phrase has been reported as being instead true — and, then, I shall here document them all to be not just false but the reverse of truth, the exact opposite of the reality):

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine” (commonly used in U.S.-and-allied official Government statements).

“unprovoked war in Ukraine” (two typical examples using it are this and this).

“Russian aggression against Ukraine” (two typical examples using it are this and this).

Any alleged report that employs any such phrase is propaganda — lying ‘news’ or ‘history’ — that bases itself upon the false unstated assumption that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 started the war in Ukraine, instead of responded to a war in Ukraine that U.S. President Barack Obama’s Administration (including Joe Biden) — the American Government — had actually started there, in 2014, against Ukraine’s adjoining nation of Russia. America is planning ultimately to invade Russia from the only nation that is only 300 miles away from Moscow (Russia’s central command — far closer than Cuba was to Washington DC during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis).

Here, as proven in the links, are the historical facts, documenting the U.S. Government’s increasing aggression against Russia — using Ukraine as its primary springboard in its plan to conquer Russia:

The Obama Administration perpetrated in February 2014 a bloody Ukrainian coup (hidden behind popular anti-corruption Ukrainian demonstrations that the CIA and State Department had trained and organized local racist-fascist anti-Russian Ukrainians to lead) overthrowing the democratically elected President of Ukraine and replacing him by a racist-fascist (ideologically nazi) regime that immediately replaced Ukraine’s generals with ones to ethnically cleanse pro-Russian Ukrainians and kill some and terrorize the others to flee into Russia so as to get rid of the people in the Ukrainian regions that had voted 70% or more for that democratically elected President — and this ethnic cleansing would enable the nazi U.S.-installed regime in Ukraine to be ‘democratically elected’, and so to continue the U.S.-Government’s control over that country, on Russia’s border.

For the full details, see this.

So: all three of those phrases (“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”, “unprovoked war in Ukraine”, and “Russian aggression against Ukraine”) are lies, which reverse the aggressor (purportedly Russia, but actually America) and the defender (purportedly Ukraine — which is America’s proxy in its war against Russia — but actually Russia).

The war in Ukraine started with Obama’s coup, not with Putin’s ultimate response to it (which occurred soon after America’s rejection on 7 January 2022, of Russia’s demand, NOT to allow Ukraine into NATO).

America’s plan here is to place its missiles on Ukraine’s border with Russia, only a five-minute-missile-flight away from blitz-nuking The Kremlin and thereby beheading Russia’s central command — too fast for Russia to be able to launch its retaliatory missiles.

 Erdogan – Moscow and Kiev agree exchange of 200 prisoners

Russia releases captured Western mercenary fighters – Reuters

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has mediated the release by Russia of ten foreign combatants in the Ukraine conflict, Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry announced on Wednesday. Hailing from five countries, the mercenaries had been captured while fighting for Kiev.

The prisoners, who are citizens of Croatia, Morocco, Sweden, the UK and the US, were transferred from Russia to Saudi Arabia by Saudi authorities, according to a statement from the ministry. Saudi officials are now “facilitating procedures for their safe return to their respective countries,” the announcement continued.

Bin Salman personally negotiated the release, which took place as part of a wider exchange of prisoners of war between Russia and Ukraine, the ministry added.

The full details of the POW exchange are unclear, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Moscow and Kiev had agreed to exchange 200 prisoners. This exchange would be the largest such swap since Russia’s military operation in Ukraine began in February.

Erdogan, whose government helped broker a deal earlier this summer to restart grain shipments from Ukrainian ports, said this exchange represented “a very important step.”

In addition to receiving tens of billions of dollars worth of Western arms, Ukraine has leaned heavily on foreign mercenaries to bolster its military. According to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, more than 2,000 of these foreign fighters have been eliminated by Russian troops and the militias of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics.

Shoigu said on Wednesday that just over 1,000 foreigners remain active in the ranks of the Ukrainian military. The Russian minister added that more than 150 NATO officers and advisers are in Kiev, where they are planning and commanding Ukraine’s forces.

 Letters to the Editor: No, Korean BBQ isn’t going away because of L.A.’s new gas law

To the editor: As an Asian American and advocate for healthier, safer communities for all, I was really disappointed by the article, “The end of Korean BBQ in L.A.? What the gas stove ban means for your fave restaurants.”

People in my community freaked out over the headline, re-sharing this misleading article many times on social media. Simply put, the truth is this: Our favorite restaurants will be fine, as the city of Los Angeles’ ban on most gas appliances in new construction does not apply to existing buildings or existing Korean BBQ restaurants. Their kitchens do not have to be altered due to this measure.

I talked to people who re-shared the article online who did not understand this simple truth based on your headline and article.

That said, I appreciated some commentary in the article about the concerns of chefs who are used to cooking with gas and are thinking about opening new restaurants. It is my hope that chefs across L.A. can discover new ways to cook without harmful gas.

The wok was invented thousands of years ago and used without fossil fuels, and today, we have induction cooking, which I can personally attest is a wonderful way to cook without toxic emissions. We’re all in this together, so let’s act now to deliver a healthier future for generations to come.

Jennifer Ho, La Crescenta

..

To the editor: The California Restaurant Assn. is on the wrong side of history in its opposition to all-electric kitchens. Sadly, this is not the first time restaurant associations have opposed public health and safety measures. In fact, restaurant associations once fought smoke-free laws, with funding from Big Tobacco.

To protect public health and reduce climate emissions from gas stoves, our kitchens and homes will need to be upgraded from gas to electric. Thankfully, induction cooking is a superior cooking technology that keeps kitchens cooler and safer. For chefs cooking primarily with woks, there are electric woks.

Climate change and the health dangers of gas are not going away. Instead of ignoring the problem or fighting health-protective solutions, our field must innovate to continue to prepare the dishes we love safely for our families and customers — and the planet.

 A top mosquito expert has blasted Professor Dame Jenny Harries’s claim that climate change will make dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases common in the U.K. within 20 years, branding it “entirely fictional” and “shameless”.

Professor Harries, who heads the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA), recently said that rising temperatures will make such diseases common in the U.K. by 2040 because the Asian Tiger Mosquito – which can transmit dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever and other viral diseases – will become established throughout Britain. Dengue will become endemic in London, she claimed.

But Professor Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and a leading expert in mosquito-borne diseases, has ridiculed her claims. He told Net Zero Watch:

The natural range of the Tiger mosquito, an Asian species, extends from the tropics to regions where mean January temperatures are around –10°C. Northern strains are able to survive because in late summer, as days grow shorter, the eggs they lay are dormant and remain unhatched until spring arrives.

It is true that since the late 1970s, there has been rapid global spread of the Tiger mosquito to the United States, Latin America, Europe and across Africa, probably mainly via the global trade in used tyres. Professor Reiter says that it is beyond doubt that this has nothing at all to do with temperature.

Professor Reiter has also lambasted fearmongering about the return of malaria, noting that this was once a major cause of death in many parts of England, even during the Little Ice Age from the 1300s to the 1800s, and its disappearance was, once again, nothing to do with temperature:

Shakespeare mentions malaria – “the ague” – 13 times, so it was clearly once common here. The disease began to decline – for a multitude of reasons – in the mid-19th century, despite the upward trend in global temperatures.

Net Zero Watch Director Andrew Montford said:

This is not the first time we have seen the Civil Service misleading the public in this way. Science is being misused to generate fear and to ‘nudge’ us in a desired direction. This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute.

But it seems our public officials won’t miss an opportunity to bang the climate alarmist drum as they attempt to cajole and coerce the public into accepting radical cuts in living standards to ward off threats based solely on the perennially wrong outputs of biased computer models.

 President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused US politicians of playing political games around the issue of aid for his country and claims that they don’t care how many people in Ukraine are dying.

Zelensky made his comments as US lawmakers prepared to vote on a controversial aid package for Ukraine that has been stalled in Congress for months due to a bitter dispute between Democrats and Republicans.

RT reports: In an interview on Monday, Zelensky referred to comments made at the weekend by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. The US politician told Fox News that he planned to move forward with a vote on an aid bill for Israel this week, without specifying when a Ukraine package would be taken up, or whether it would be tied to funding for West Jerusalem.

“This is pure politics, and it’s a disgrace for the world and a disgrace for democracy,” Zelensky told PBS NewsHour. “Nobody cares how many people are dying in Ukraine every day. They only care about their approval ratings,” he added

Johnson has since promised to advance the long-stalled Ukraine aid bill sought by President Joe Biden this week, multiple news outlets reported on Monday. Johnson reportedly told Republican colleagues at a closed-door meeting that he intends to allow the House to vote on a standalone bill in the coming days that would ensure additional military aid for Kiev. The House will also be expected to vote on separate bills providing more assistance to Israel and Taiwan.

House Republicans have previously refused to back the foreign aid bill unveiled by Biden in October, which includes $61 billion in assistance for Ukraine.

The legislation has been held up for months as the GOP tries to force the White House to crack down on the influx of illegal immigrants via the southern US border. Biden’s 2024 election rival, former President Donald Trump, previously urged Republicans to block the bill, arguing against unconditional aid for Ukraine.

The delay in approving more weapons for Ukraine has rattled Zelensky and other officials in Kiev, who are blaming mounting battlefield losses on shortages of foreign-supplied ammunition and air defenses.

In his interview with PBS, Zelensky reiterated that without the US support, Ukraine “will have no chance of winning” in its conflict with Russia.

Moscow, meanwhile, has repeatedly stated that no amount of foreign assistance will change the outcome of the fighting, and has accused the West of escalating the hostilities.",1,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

 Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has promised he is ""ready to fight"" following reports of multiple Ukrainian mayors being kidnapped by the invading Russian military.

Ukraine has accused Russian forces of capturing mayors in Dniprorudne and Melitopol in recent days, sparking concerns that additional mayors could be kidnapped next, including the mayor of the country's capital city.

Klitschko, who was a highly regarded world heavyweight boxing champion before entering politics, insisted during a Fox News interview on Monday that any Russian soldiers who hope to capture him would find that their task was ""not easy.""

""I am ready to fight,"" Klitschko said after America Reports host John Roberts asked him about a potential kidnapping attempt. ""This will be not easy to do that ... nobody feels safety in our country right now in this very difficult situation. Everyone [is] ready to fight, ready to defend our city.""

""I am not worried about kidnap,"" he added. ""I am ready to fight, that's why I have weapons, that's why it's my hometown and I want to defend the interest of my citizens, the interest of my home, the interest of my family.""

Ukrainian officials announced the kidnapping of Dniprorudne Mayor Matveev Sergeevich on Sunday, while they said that Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov was captured two days earlier. Russia went on to appoint a Moscow-friendly mayor in Melitopol.

While commenting on the kidnapping of Fedorov, which was partially captured on video, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserted that ""the actions of Russian invaders will be equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists.""

Klitschko suggested that the kidnappings were part of a pattern of ""un-human"" Russian troops choosing to ignore the international rules of war, noting that mayors are civilian targets.

""War also has rules,"" said Klitschko. ""But Russians [don't] want the rules ... what they want is the symbol ... they can't break the mood of the people and that's why they kidnap the mayors.""

""Its actually against all rules,"" Klitschko continued. ""We see how unfriendly, how un-human activity make Russians in our land.""

Following Russian bombing campaigns on Monday, the Kyiv mayor surveyed scenes of damage in the city alongside his brother Wladimir Klitschko, who is also a former world heavyweight boxing champion.

""That's what Russia's war against the civilians looks like,"" Wladimir Klitschko said while standing in the rubble in a video uploaded to Twitter. ""Destroyed buildings, destroyed infrastructure. [A] city bus just got hit by a rocket. Lives are getting lost, that's the war that Russia started.""

According to the Ukrainian government, Monday's Russian strikes on Kyiv also included a missile hitting a nine-story residential building, leaving two dead and three others hospitalized.

Newsweek reached out to the Embassy of Russia in Washington, D.C., for comment.

 China shares inclusive development with the world: Former Director-General of UNESCO

Former Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, receives an exclusive interview with People's Daily Online in Beijing, Sep. 10, 2024. (People's Daily Online/Zhang Wenjie).

China's modernization and inclusive development have helped 1.4 billion Chinese people, set examples, and shared experiences with other countries, benefiting the world as a whole, said Irina Bokova, former Director-General of UNESCO.

Bokova, who is also the Honorary Dean of the School of International Organizations at Beijing Foreign Studies University, visited China several times and voiced her appreciation for China's rapid progress over the last several decades, stating that China's tremendous economic, social, and technological advancements have contributed significantly to the experience of the globe. She also noted that through cooperation mechanisms such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, China is fulfilling its obligation to share its inclusive growth with other countries.

""UNESCO and China have together developed many joint activities, partnerships and initiatives, among my most memorable moments was President Xi Jinping's visit to UNESCO a decade ago,"" Bokova told People's Daily Online during an exclusive interview.

In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at the headquarters of UNESCO in Paris, laying out his vision of civilization that features diversity, equality and inclusiveness.

""We need to encourage different civilizations to respect each other and live together in harmony while promoting their exchanges and mutual learning as a bridge of friendship among peoples, a driving force behind human society, and a strong bond for world peace,"" President Xi said.

""President Xi's speech about diversity is very important, it shows that though we belong to different cultures, we are all members of one shared community,"" said Bokova.

According to Bokova, China is fulfilling its responsibility to share its success with the rest of the world by promoting collaboration and inclusive development. For example, China was the first developing country to realize one of the UN Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, making a significant contribution to the global poverty alleviation cause.

""China's commitment, inclusive development, and strong leadership demonstrate to the world that equality and inclusion in society are attainable. This benefits not only the Chinese people, but also other countries around the world,"" added Bokova.

Bokova has also praised China's ""new quality productive forces"". With innovation playing the leading role, new quality productive forces are forces that feature advanced productivity and are free from traditional economic growth modes and productivity development paths. They are defined by high-tech, high efficiency and high quality, and are in line with the new development philosophy.

""It is a very interesting and innovative concept China is taking. I think it is justified because the world and global economy are entering a new phase, and it is critical to use innovation and technology to encourage young people to use all of the potential of science to achieve equality and social inclusion, as well as to address challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss,"" said Bokova, adding that ""new quality productive forces"" have the potential to reconcile humans with nature while maintaining all of the benefits of technological progress.

 Putin’s masses of HIV-positive prisoners choosing to go to meat-grinder frontline rather than rot in jail with no meds

RUSSIAN prisoners who have tested positive for HIV are choosing to be sent to the frontline hoping to get lifesaving medication.

A large number of Vladimir Putin's HIV-positive prisoner recruits deemed they preferred the battlefield rather than rot in jail where they were denied treatment.

The Wagner Group has been mass-recruiting inmates from Russia's infamous prisons, offering them a pardon if they survive for six months.

Ukrainian officials estimate about 20 per cent of recruits in Russian prisoner units are HIV positive.

And a lot of them were so desperate for the anti-viral medications they couldn't get in jail, they opted to join Putin's bloody war in Ukraine, the New York Times reported.

Speaking from a detention centre in Dnipro, an HIV-positive Russian soldier named Timur, 37, told the newspaper: ""Conditions were very harsh.""

He said how doctors in prison changed the anti-viral medication to a different type that he suspected was not effective.

Fearing he was not going to last his ten-year sentence behind bars, agreed to join Putin's bloodthirsty Wagner Group for six months in exchange for a pardon and supplies of anti-viral medications.

Speaking about the dilemma of poor treatment in prison or fight in Ukraine, he said: ""I understood I would have a quick death or a slow death. I chose a quick death.""

Timur, who had no military experience said he had two weeks of training before being deployed to Bakhmut- where one of the bloodiest battles of the war happened.

Most read in The Sun

He said that the unit's commanders ""repeated many times, ‘if you try to leave this field, we will shoot you.’""

While he was captured, he said that most of the soldiers were killed on their first day.

Another soldier named Ruslan, 42, said he welcomed Wagner's acceptance of HIV-positive inmates and joined the frontline for a chance at medication and freedom.

He said: ""If you have a long sentence, it gives you a chance to begin life again.""

New conscripts in Putin's private army were forced to wear coloured-coded wristbands to signify they had serious infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's Ministry of Defence claimed that Russia marks these ""sick 'fighters' with appropriate bracelets on their hands"".

""In order to 'mark' infected militants, the command of 'Wagners' forces them to wear red bracelets on the arm in case of HIV, and white bracelets in case of hepatitis,"" the Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence said in a statement.

The report suggested that Russian conscripts were furious about having to serve alongside ""infected"" militants and military doctors regularly refused to provide assistance to the infected soldiers if they got wounded on the battlefield.

Another HIV prisoner Yevgeny who suffered a gunshot wound before he was captured, said that although he did receive treatment, he felt medics were careless about infecting other patients around him.

He said: ""There were no conditions for the HIV infected.

""We were all treated together, the healthy and the unhealthy.""

 Letters to the Editor: Offshore wind can be California’s next Gold Rush

To the editor: Just as the Pacific was critical in transporting miners in the rush for gold and has been key to our state’s and our nation’s epic transoceanic commerce, it can now usher in our next Gold Rush in the form of offshore wind power.

Kudos to Michelle Solomon and Taylor McNair for reminding readers that this form of clean, renewable energy blowing along our coast needs only to be harnessed with floating wind turbines and transmitted via infrastructure to our population centers, facilitated by Inflation Reduction Act financial incentives.

The technology is available, the seed money to pay for the launch of this promising enterprise exists and the need for offshore wind energy could not be greater as the climate crisis ravages much of the world.

Gov. Newsom, this is your summons to even bolder climate leadership.

Ginger Osborne, Laguna Beach

..

To the editor: California stands to benefit from cleaner air, good-paying jobs and reliable energy with offshore wind technology. But policymakers need to pass legislation that locks in investment and resources for offshore wind to ultimately succeed in our state.

California should start by ensuring a market exists for the clean power that offshore wind will create. To do that, the Legislature should pass AB 1373. This piece of legislation ensures central procurement for offshore wind, meaning the Public Utilities Commission will start requiring utilities and companies servicing Californians’ electrical needs to have a diverse portfolio of clean energy sources — including offshore wind.

Lawmakers need to kick-start offshore wind in California, and they can start by passing AB 1373.

Dan Jacobson, Elk Grove, Calif.

To the editor: I agree that California should become a leader in building and deploying floating wind turbines. And while we can help this “nascent” technology emerge, we shouldn’t wait for it to mature to deploy offshore wind.

There are many unsightly oil platforms not far off the coast, particularly in Huntington Beach and Long Beach. These are grounded. We should deploy grounded wind turbines at similar depths and distances.

 Fetterman drapes himself in Israeli flag during DC rally in support of the Jewish state

Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) draped himself in an Israel flag as he joined the nearly 300,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, DC, Tuesday in support of the Jewish state as it wages war against Hamas terrorists.

The Pennsylvania Democrat was photographed at the March for Israel rally with the blue and white flag wrapped over his trademark hoodie as he greeted attendees.

Fetterman has been unequivocal in his staunch support of Israel since Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack despite facing some left-wing backlash over his stance.

“Of course I’m here, how could I not!” Fetterman told one rally-goer, according to an attendee’s X post.

A sharp-eyed X user pointed out that Fetterman used the strings on his hoodie to affix the flag to himself in “the most bipartisan act I’ve ever seen from a Senator.”

Fetterman’s fondness for the Israeli flag triggered several pro-Palestinian protesters outside the US Capitol last week, after the senator emerged from the building waving a small Star of David flag above his head as some demonstrators were being arrested.

“Shame! What a joke!” some of the booing protesters shouted as Fetterman strolled by.

In his office, the senator also displays the posters of the innocent Israelis kidnapped by Hamas terrorists during their deadly raid which also killed 1,200 people.

“They will stay up until every single person is safely returned home,” Fetterman noted in a video posted on X.

Fetterman has also argued against a cease-fire in the conflict, which has reportedly angered some of his supporters and former staffers.

“Now is not the time to talk about a ceasefire. We must support Israel in efforts to eliminate the Hamas terrorists who slaughtered innocent men, women, and children,” the former lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania said in anOct. 18 post on X. “Hamas does not want peace, they want to destroy Israel. We can talk about a ceasefire after Hamas is neutralized.”

Fetterman, however, has remained a harsh critic of congressional Republican efforts to decouple US military aid for Israel from a separate aid proposal for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion.

On Tuesday he called on his GOP colleagues in the upper chamber to cease efforts to pass a stand-alone Israel aid bill.

“Israel and Ukraine are going through existential threats. We need to send aid to BOTH, and my Republican colleagues need to cut the crap,” Fetterman wrote on X.

 Russia ‘could split off from global internet’ – and US fears that Russian web could look like China’s Great Firewall

RUSSIA could split off from the global internet as the Kremlin cracks down on the web, officials fear.

As real war rages in Ukraine, Russia has is pushing ahead with an intense information war online.

A key battleground in the Kremlin's online crackdown is the Russian internet.

Several businesses have shut down their online and physical operations in Russia.

Meanwhile, Kremlin officials led by President Vladimir Putin have blocked access to some of the platforms that have not halted service in Russia.

Instagram, which is three times as popular as Facebook in Russia, was blocked by state officials.

The Kremlin’s plans to isolate Russia from the global internet predate the invasion of Ukraine.

In 2019, Russia passed the Sovereign Internet Law which redirects traffic through Russian servers – allowing a watchful Kremlin to censor the web.

In 2021, the Russian government labeled the internet a national security threat.

This month, Russia’s deputy digital minister Andrei Chernenko directed Russian websites to switch to domain name system (DNS) servers that are within Russia’s borders.

In doing so, internet operations in Russia are dependent on hardware within the country which strengthens the state’s ability to control content.

Russian citizens can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to bypass Russia’s rigid internet restrictions.

A VPN shields your IP address, hides your physical location and scrambles the record of your internet history.

But with Visa, Mastercard and American Express suspending operations in Russia, many citizens have no way to pay for web tools to help them evade Russian censorship policies.

Kremlin crackdown

The Russians' work to domesticate the internet is not unlike the Chinese Great Firewall internet policy.

China governs the internet with intense scrutiny and has loads of restrictions against international websites.

The Chinese government has ownership over internet channels and lends access to people and businesses.

Chinese internet users rarely explore web pages that are based or created outside of China.

FreedomHouse, a nonprofit focused on analyzing the strength of freedom across the world, ranked the Chinese internet as one of the least free in the world with a score of 10/100.

The United States, for comparison, has an internet freedom score of 75/100.

In fracturing the internet, China and Russia leave citizens just with state-approved networks as their only source of information.

""They want the ability to move to not one big global network but different networks where you can surveil your citizens more easily,” Karen Kornbluh, an expert on US-European diplomacy, told NBC News.

“In the longer term, Russia wants to be able to cut off access to Signal,” Kornbluh said.

Signal is a secure messaging app used by journalists to avoid government snooping – and it's now the fastest growing app in Russia.

RT, one of Russia’s state-controlled media networks, has pushed false justifications for the invasion of Ukraine and has come under fire for other propagandist tendencies.

 Republican lawmakers will probe the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and large private investors for their role in pushing an environmental agenda throughout the financial sector after the midterm elections.

Republican Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said that investigating the Biden administration and Wall Street’s use of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) principles will be a major focus of his committee if Republicans gain a majority in the House on Nov. 8, according to The Washington Post. The lawmakers argue that large financial institutions have withheld investment from businesses that they don’t consider to be eco-friendly based on their ESG criteria. (RELATED: Kentucky Officials Demand Proof That State Pension Funds Aren’t Used For Woke Investing)

“My view is that ESG investing is a cancer within our capital markets,” Barr told the Post. “It is a fraud on American investors.”

Barr and other Republicans hope to force SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to answer questions on the agency’s proposed climate disclosure rule, which would require all publicly traded companies to disclose their carbon emissions and climate change risks, the Post reported. The rule could allow climate-focused investors to more easily discern the “climate risks” of certain businesses and pressure them to become more eco-friendly.

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska introduced a bill in May to combat major investors’ influence and will continue discussing such actions with industry executives, his spokesman told the Post.

“We’ve become the loud noise in their right ear after all the screaming in their left ear,” Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said about GOP efforts to push back against Wall Street firms’ climate-focused investment strategies, according to the Post.

Republican Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri and ranking member on the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions told the Post that he wants to force BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street executives to testify in front of the financial services committee as the three massive money managers have used their financial influence to push companies to adopt their climate agenda and other political movements.

BlackRock, which manages nearly $8 trillion in assets, has been scrutinized by Republican attorneys general and state treasurers over its alleged failure to place the interests of its investors above the firm’s stance on climate change.

The Republicans are expected to take back the House in the midterm elections and will hold a majority in the House Financial Services Committee as well as other committees that can be used to probe the SEC, banks and asset managers.

 Moscow court rejects Evan Gershkovich’s appeal, keeping him in jail until at least June 30

Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich will remain jailed on espionage charges until at least late June, after a Moscow court Tuesday rejected his appeal that sought to end his pretrial detention.

The 32-year-old U.S. citizen was detained in late March 2023 while on a reporting trip and has spent more than a year in jail, with authorities routinely extending his time behind bars and rejecting his appeals. Last month, his pretrial detention was continued yet again — until June 30 — in a ruling that he and his lawyers challenged. A Moscow appellate court rejected the appeal Tuesday.

In the courtroom on Tuesday, Gershkovich, wearing a white T-shirt and an open checked shirt, looked relaxed, at times laughing and chatting with members of his legal team.

His arrest in the city of Yekaterinburg rattled journalists in Russia, where authorities have not detailed what, if any, evidence they have to support the espionage charges.

U.S. journalist marks a year in a Russian prison as courts keep extending his time behind bars

Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich marks a year behind bars Friday following his arrest by Russian authorities who accuse him of espionage.

Gershkovich and his employer have denied the allegations, and the U.S. government has declared him to be wrongfully detained.

Analysts have pointed out that Moscow may be using jailed Americans as bargaining chips in U.S.-Russian tensions over the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine. At least two U.S. citizens arrested in Russia in recent years — including WNBA star Brittney Griner — have been exchanged for Russians jailed in the United States.

In December, the U.S. State Department said it had made a significant offer to secure the release ofGershkovich and Paul Whelan, another American imprisoned in Russia on espionage charges, that it said Moscow had rejected.

Officials did not describe the offer, although Russia has been said to be seeking the release of Vadim Krasikov, who was given a life sentence in Germany in 2021 for the killing in Berlin of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of Chechen descent who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany.

A Russian court extends the pretrial detention for American reporter accused of spying

A court in Moscow ruled to keep Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in custody pending his trial on espionage charges.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, asked this year about releasing Gershkovich, appeared to refer to Krasikov by pointing to a man imprisoned by a U.S. ally for “liquidating a bandit” who had allegedly killed Russian soldiers during separatist fighting in Chechnya.

Beyond that hint, Russian officials have kept mum about the talks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeatedly said that while “certain contacts” on swaps continue, “they must be carried out in absolute silence.”

Gershkovich is the first U.S. reporter to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since 1986, when Nicholas Daniloff, a Moscow correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, was arrested by the KGB. Daniloff was released 20 days later in a swap for an employee of the Soviet Union’s United Nations mission who was arrested by the FBI, also on spying charges.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Josep Borrell, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, called Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó’s accusation that the European Union is “pro-war” completely unacceptable,

“This is totally unacceptable. The European Union is not in favor of war. The European Union is not on the side of war,” Borrell said, adding that the EU is supporting Ukraine in its war against aggression by Russia and wants to end the war in accordance with the UN Charter.

Borrell also said the “unacceptable approach” of the Hungarian government regarding Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s visit to Moscow and Kyiv would be discussed at a separate meeting on Monday.

Borrell noted that member states should be looking at how investment and funding could help Ukraine, such as by restoring its damaged electricity infrastructure as soon as possible and providing additional air defense systems.

“These are the two most important things right now,” he stressed.

Borrell also commented on the opinion issued by the UN International Court of Justice (ICJ), which was delivered on Friday, according to which Israel’s settlement policy and use of natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territories violate international law and Israel must pay reparations to the Palestinians for the damage caused by the occupation.

He said that these conclusions were largely in line with the EU position, which he said was fully consistent with UN resolutions on the status of the occupied Palestinian territories.

 The G20 leaders are set to state that today's era ""must not be of war"" at the summit in Bali, a British newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing a draft communique agreed by diplomats involved in the negotiations to finalise the document.

The key line on the Ukraine conflict in the draft communique almost echoes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's message to Russian President Vladimir Putin in September that 'today's era is not of war'.

There have been a series of negotiations among the diplomats of the G20 member countries over the formulation relating to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia and China are also members of the G-20 which operate on the principle of consensus.

In his bilateral meeting with Putin in Uzbekistan on September 16, Modi said ""today's era is not of war"" and nudged him to end the conflict.

The Indian delegation played a big role in achieving consensus among member states over the wording criticising the Russian invasion, the Financial Times (FT) said, citing two unnamed officials with knowledge of the negotiations.

Prime Minister Modi and several leaders of the G20 countries touched upon the Ukraine crisis in their remarks at the grouping's summit that began in Bali on Tuesday.

World leaders will state that today's era ""must not be of war"" at the G20 summit in Bali, according to a draft communique agreed by diplomats that also condemned threats of nuclear weapons use, the newspaper said.

""The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Today's era must not be of war,"" the draft statement said, according to FT.

The communique was agreed by country delegates on Monday night but must still be signed off by G20 leaders at the two-day summit, the report said.

The G20 ""will make clear that Russia's war is wreaking havoc for people everywhere"", the report said, quoting a senior US official.

An Indonesian official said discussions on the draft statement were ""still dynamic"" and might change, it said.

In his address at the summit, Modi on Tuesday referred to his repeated call for resolving the crisis through talks.

""I have repeatedly said that we have to find a way to return to the path of ceasefire and diplomacy in Ukraine. Over the past century, the Second World War wreaked havoc in the world,"" he said.

Since the Ukraine conflict began in February, Prime Minister Modi spoke to Russian President Putin as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a number of times.

In a phone conversation with Zelenskyy on October 4, Modi said that there can be ""no military solution"" and that India is ready to contribute to any peace efforts.

 UK intelligence experts are concerned that Russia will use “fabricated” claims regarding chemical weapons in Ukraine to move forward with a “false-flag operation.”

“Russia could possibly be planning to use chemical or biological weapons in a ‘false-flag’ operation. Such an operation could take the form of a faked attack, a staged ‘discovery’ of agents or munitions, or fabricated evidence of alleged Ukrainian planning to use such weapons,” officials said, adding that such a “false-flag” attack would “almost certainly be accompanied by extensive disinformation to complicate attribution.”

Officials added that intelligence suggests that Moscow had likely intended to use false-flag operations as justification for its invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24.

However, analysts believe that the narrative is part of the Kremlin’s plan to create a false-flag operation in an attempt to justify using chemical weapons operations in Ukraine itself.

Yet both the United States and Ukraine maintain that the laboratories seek to prevent bioweapons and pathogens, a project backed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an agency within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).

In response to Russia’s allegations, State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that the disinformation being spread by Russia is “total nonsense and not the first time Russia has invented such false claims against another country.”

The UK Ministry of Defence’s report comes as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on March 13 that the Kremlin might use chemical or biological weapons in its invasion of Ukraine, which would amount to a war crime.

The NATO Secretary General echoed comments by the UK’s Ministry of Defense that Russia could be using the claims to create a false pretext to justify its actions.

“Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies.

 Ukrainians show strength at Deaflympics in Brazil

Caxias do Sul (Brazil) (AFP) – When Rymma Filimoshkina practiced the hammer throw in the yard near her house in Mariupol at the start of the Ukraine war, her neighbors thought she was throwing a bomb.

Issued on:

But her ""weapon"" isn't one of destruction: it just won the 33-year-old deaf athlete a gold medal at the Deaflympics in Brazil.

Thousands of kilometers (miles) from the conflict at home, the Ukrainian team is raking in the medals at the Olympics for the deaf, which opened on May 1 and wrap up Sunday in the southern city of Caxias do Sul.

With two days left to go in the Games, Ukraine had a commanding lead in the medal table, with a total of 116 -- more than double the second-place United States.

""In this event, we show the world we exist: we are Ukraine, a real powerful, independent and democratic country,"" said Valeriy Sushkevych, president of the Ukraine Paralympic committee.

""One soldier called us and said: in between battles, we support you on TV. Your fighting spirit in sports is very important for us,"" he told AFP.

'Really want' peace

Ukraine has a history of punching above its weight in disabled sport.

Its Paralympic program owes its success to two and a half decades of specialized schools in every region of the country for children with disabilities, who start participating in sporting programs at an early age, Sushkevych says.

Ukraine finished sixth in the medal table at the Summer Paralympics in Tokyo last year, and second at the Winter Paralympics in Beijing in March, just after Russia launched its invasion.

The team's success at the Deaflympics is symbolically charged: Ukraine had finished second in the medal table at the last three editions of the event -- behind Russia, which was banned from all international competitions over the invasion.

""I dedicate these medals to Ukraine. I'm very proud to represent my country,"" said a smiling Dmytro Levin, a 24-year-old native of Kharkiv, speaking in sign language after winning two golds and a bronze in orienteering.

""I'm happy to have won this medal for Ukraine. But all I really want is peace,"" said 15-year-old Sofia Chernomorova, who won bronze in badminton.

'Didn't hear the sirens'

Filimoshkina said she still remembers the vibrations she felt with every bomb that exploded in Mariupol, the port city devastated by relentless Russian strikes.

""A lot of deaf people died because they didn't hear the air raid sirens and went outside at the wrong time,"" she said.

Her teammate Julia Kysylova, who won silver in the hammer throw, said that for a long time, she was sure they would have to cancel their trip for the Games.

""When the war erupted, it was impossible to train. I spent a month sheltering at home,"" said the 25-year-old athlete from Nova Kakhovka, in the hard-hit southern region of Kherson.

She finally managed to flee to Spain, leaving her husband behind.

""It was a miracle we managed to cross the border. The trip took more than two days,"" she said.

""After the Games, I hope to go back home and be with my husband,"" she added.

""But I don't know if that will be possible.""

Criticizing Soviet society was a serious crime in those days, but I doubt that the Russians ever considered arresting Nixon and giving him a ten year stretch in the gulag for “anti-Soviet agitation.” Not even Maoist China at the height of its Cultural Revolution would have considered such a thing.

But late last week, on the eve of a Russia-China leadership summit in Moscow, Europe’s International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the man who controls the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, whose striking power is further enhanced by its revolutionary hypersonic delivery systems.

The charges against Putin were that he had ordered the humanitarian evacuation of children from the dangerous Ukraine warzone, and the ICC also ordered the arrest of Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights.

Yet oddly enough, no ICC action had ever been taken against American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had famously declared in 1996 that the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children brought about by the American economic sanctions she supported was “worth it.”

Indeed, in 2016 National Security Advisor John Bolton leveled harsh threats against ICC judges if they dared take legal action against any Americans accused of torture and murder, and many have noticed the strange lack of ICC even-handedness over the years.

But issuing a press release or even an arrest warrant does not necessarily determine events in real life, and the Moscow summit between Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has hardly been disturbed. Taken together, Russia and China control a substantial fraction of the world’s natural resources and industrial capacity, and although their global propaganda presence is weak, those former factors are more important as elements of real world power.

As an example of this, last week Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of the most important Middle Eastern countries, announced in Beijing that after negotiations held under Chinese auspices they had reestablished diplomatic relations despite many years of bitter hostility:

Over the last few months, America and its Western allies have declared their unilateral right to set a cap on the price Russia charges for its oil, seeking to use their dominance over the international financial infrastructure to reduce Russian revenue on its sale of natural resources to other countries.

Russia and Saudi Arabia are two of the world’s leading oil exporters, and with the latter nation now having dramatically shifted towards the Russia-China alliance, its leadership recently declared that they would ban sales to any country that sought to impose a price cap on its oil.",1,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia has international support from a number of countries and people']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

 by Leo Hohmann, Leo Hohmann:

Using duplicity, deception and secret alliances, the U.K.’s inner circle of top elites led by Nathaniel Rothschild, King Edward VII, and Lord Alfred Milner backed the German Kaiser into a corner and intentionally set the Germans up to blame them for starting the First World War, when in fact it was the British who provoked the Germans to the point where war was the only option.

German generals were caught strategizing several weeks ago on how to bomb Russia’s main bridge to Crimea. This would be an act of aggression that Russian President Vladimir Putin described as guaranteed to draw a harsh military response from Russia, possibly even including a nuclear strike against Berlin.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

And that has led to an admission by German officials that their military is woefully unprepared to take on Russia. If German generals and politicians truly want to provoke a war with Russia, they had better slow down and wait for their military to catch up to the political rhetoric coming out of Berlin.

A March 14 article by John Cody at Remix News shows that the German Army lacks the personnel, equipment and infrastructure to wage a major war of any kind, let alone with a nuclear-armed military superpower like Russia.

“Germany’s own military and government are painting such a dire picture of the armed forces that there are now calls from some of the most powerful politicians in the country to reinstate mandatory military service,” Cody writes.

Yes, a military draft.

A video produced by Remix News details testimony provided by Eva Högl, German Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, who provided catastrophic details about the state of the German military. It is shocking in terms of its candor regarding the current state of the German armed forces.

She finds it “really impressive” that Germany has emptied out its military defense stocks by handing it over to Ukraine to be wasted in a losing war with Russia. That sounds like an admission of treason in the wide open.

But wait. There’s more.

Germany knows it is incapable of taking on Russia so it is negotiating a secret deal with the insane leaders of two other European countries, France and Poland, for the very purpose of sending troops into Ukraine separate from NATO, although I do not believe this could truly be done without the acquiescence of Washington and London.

An organization called the Weimar Triangle – composed of France, Germany and Poland – has been in existence since 1991 at the fall of the Soviet Union.

The stated purpose of the Weimar Triangle was to assist Poland’s emergence from Communist rule. It’s strange that it still exists but it may have found a new purpose – instigating World War III with Russia.

According to Wikipedia, “the Weimar Triangle exists mostly in the form of summit meetings between the leaders of the three countries and of their foreign ministers. The collaboration between member states includes inter-parliamentary contacts, military, scientific and cultural co-operation. The most recent summit of leaders occurred in Paris on June 12, 2023.” (Emphasis mine)",1,"['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Zelensky Seeks To Cancel Russia At UN, Asks Why ""Russian Terrorists"" Have A Place

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is trying to use his visit to the United Nations in New York to get Russia canceled from the international assembly. He questioned how it is that ""Russian terrorists"" have a seat at the UN. He also warned that Russia is poised to expand its war beyond Ukraine - an assertion with no evidence.

""If in the United Nations there is a place for Russian terrorists,"" Zelensky said, ""it’s a question to all the members of the United Nations."" ...Except that of course Russia doesn't hold just any UN seat, but it's permanent member of the UN Security Council, and exercises veto power in that capacity over the UNSC's most important resolutions and major decisions.

Zelensky made the comments on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), when he visited a hospital in Staten Island which is treating some 18 wounded Ukrainian soldiers. Zelensky has long warned that the UN is ""hostage"" to Russian policy.

As for his UNGA speech the same day, given before some 140 nations, and after Biden spoke earlier, Zelensky went on the verbal attack against Russia, giving comments in English.

""The goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our lives, our resources into a weapon against you, against the international rules-based order,"" Zelensky said. He laid out that Russia is weaponizing essentials for survival like food and energy.

""The goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our lives, our resources into a weapon against you, against the international rules-based order,"" Zelensky said, also seeking to portray a pattern of Putin's ""aggression"" from Georgia to Syria to Moldova.

He also alleged Moscow is committing ""genocide"" - and repeated media claims of Russia having ""kidnapped"" some tens of thousands of children. ""Time goes by; what will happen to them?” He then called it ""clearly a genocide.""

However, these reports of ""Russia kidnapping children"" have been based on the trend of Russian-speaking families of the Donbas in many cases willingly relocating to Russian territory, also given there had been a civil war raging there since 2014 involving pro-Kiev Ukrainians attacking pro-Russian Ukrainians in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Zelensky also used it as an occasion to condemn any potential peace plan offered by a third party which requires that Ukraine cede territory. The New York Times wrote, ""Ukraine has been seeking backing for a 10-point settlement program that demands a full Russian withdrawal and payment of reparations.""

""Zelensky pitched the audience an idea for a summit with that program on the agenda -- something Ukrainian diplomats say would be a symbolic success, even without any means to enforce such a settlement on Russia,"" the report noted.

The UN audience applauded when at the end of his remarks Zelensky said the world must work to ""end the aggression on the terms of the state that was attacked."" He's expected to later travel to Washington, where he'll lobby for billions more in American taxpayer dollars to be pledged toward the war effort.

Recently, some readers have complained to me that we are covering the Ukraine situation too closely, saying they are bored with the topic.

In fact, I’m not really covering it that closely. I’m really just giving the broad strokes, and giving people a basis upon which they can do further investigation into what is going on if they are so inclined.

If readers find the coverage boring, they can skip over it. There is a lot of other stuff on this site. I am covering the Ukraine the exact right amount. I am obligated to do this because so few outlets are covering the war with any truth or honesty. In the English language, the pro-Russia perspective is very difficult to find, with most conservatives who are against the war simply saying that they don’t care either way. “I do care and I actively support those fighting against the Washington and Brussels elite” is an important perspective that must be in the public conversation.

Someone is going to win this conflict, and someone is going to lose. The stakes could not be any higher. The future of the entire world now hinges on the outcome of this conflict. This is the single most consequential military conflict in all of human history.

If Russia loses, the Putin government will collapse, and the US will be able to steamroll the country, break it apart into several pieces. From there, the US will have China isolated, and then eventually break them. This will result in the final establishment of a singular world order run by the Jewish power centers in the United States, Europe, and Israel.

If the US loses the war, we are looking at a freefall collapse of the Western economic and military order, a rising China, and a reshuffling of the entire order of power on the planet earth.

The reason I support Russia is that I want the US empire to collapse. The reason I want the US empire to collapse is that I do not believe that the US empire is compatible with freedom in the US, and believe that we can only reestablish freedom in this country when the empire falls.

If the dollar goes down and the US can no longer export debt to the world through the dollar reserve system, the US government will no longer have the ability to micromanage the lives of American citizens. They will not have the resources (you have to have a lot of excess money to inflict your will on the entire population, which is one reason why people are so much freer in third world countries). We will be free, and we will then be able to return to the natural order in our society, without Jews controlling everything, without trannies, without deadly fake vaccines, without mass immigration, without feminism.

 ISLAMABAD-Pakistan needs to chalk out an effective and feasible plan to preserve its water resources and stop the depletion of underground water, WealthPK reported.

According to an expert, water is one of the basic necessities of life and Pakistan is blessed with an abundance of water resources. However, the country’s water resources are depleting with the passage of time. It is feared that the entire world will face an acute water shortage in the coming years. Saiqa Imran, the deputy director of the Pakistan Council of Research and Water Reservoirs (PCRWR), told WealthPK that the country was feared to face an acute shortage of fresh water. “The quantity of fresh water is quite limited in the country,” she added. According to her, climate change is the primary cause of the depletion of water resources. She said that the shortage of water triggered concerns about the future availability of water for the world’s exponentially rising population.

Saiqa Imran said that in most cases, the water table was constantly going down as a result of the frequent pumping of water from the ground. “With a growing world population, the more we pump water from the ground at a rapid rate, the harder it becomes to get the amount of water we need because we pump the groundwater faster than it can be replenished,” she added. She said that inefficient water distribution and mismanagement were the main causes of the water shortage. “Pakistan has one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems in the world where more than 93% of water is used by the agriculture sector, 5% by the domestic sector and 2% by the industrial sector,” said the expert.

She said that domestic and industrial sectors would use 15% more water by 2025 than their current consumption. She said that the agriculture sector was the biggest user of water as modern irrigation techniques were not adopted in Pakistan but its contribution to the national economy was declining with the passage of time. Saiqa Imran said that the world’s average storage capacity reached 40% but Pakistan could conserve only up to 10% of its annual river water due to insufficient space. “People have turned to use underground water as a result of the shortage of the most essential commodity. The indiscriminate over-pumping in the cities in the absence of regulatory bodies has also led to the depletion of groundwater,” she added.

According to her, there is a dire need to devise a proper pricing mechanism for water usage in any sector. She said that incentives should also be in place to encourage people to use water efficiently. The expert said that the country could take a variety of technical and management measures to conserve water at all levels, reduce irrigation losses, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient irrigation methods by creating a regulatory framework, launch licensing water, and implement integrated water resource management. “Under the principle of private sector participation and optimal water pricing, the policymakers should rethink water policy to encourage wastewater recycling,” Saiqa Imran told WealthPK.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Interview: China's green energy transition inspires countries worldwide: UNDP chief

DUBAI, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China's green energy transitions will contribute to the global fight against climate change and inspire other countries toward green transition, said Achim Steiner, head of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), in a recent interview with Xinhua.

In the interview during the 11th World Governments Summit recently held in Dubai, the UNDP administrator said China's development has been remarkable in so many respects, including poverty alleviation, and its investments in technology and the green transition.

""It is addressing some of the legacies of its rapid industrialization, the air pollution, and the cleaning up of water systems.""

China has made major commitments that it would strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, noted Steiner.

""These transitions will enable China to be both a contributor to a global response to climate change, but also with its technologies and policies will help many other countries including many developing countries to pivot forward into a green transition strategy.""

Also in the interview, Steiner highlighted China as the backbone of the international economic recovery.

His assessment comes as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects global growth to stay at 3.1 percent in 2024 and rise to 3.2 percent in 2025 while forecasting the Chinese economy to expand by 4.6 percent this year.

""The outlook on the global economy is in part also premised on China's own economic development.""

He noted that although there are many factors influencing China's recovery in terms of GDP growth, the Chinese economy is looking positive at the moment and the UNDP remains optimistic that a recovery path is on its way.

UNDP works in about 170 countries and territories, helping to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities and exclusion, and build resilience so countries can sustain progress.

As the UN's development agency, UNDP plays a critical role in helping countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

""We see great potential for our future collaboration in China with the SDGs, including on the SDG innovation hubs that China is establishing and where we are collaborating.""

Asked about his priorities for UNDP in 2024, Steiner said the challenge of climate change remains a centerpiece of UNDP's work.

The 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) is planned to take place in Brazil between Nov. 10 and 21, 2025.

""We are today committed to working with countries across the world towards the Conference of the Parties next year in Brazil, when countries will present their new nationally determined contributions and national climate plans,"" he said.

 Russia threatens nukes for US, UK, Finland if NATO expands

Vladimir Putin warned the president of Finland Saturday that any effort to join NATO would “negatively” affect relations between the two countries.

The comments followed another Russian leader’s threat to use the Satan-2 hypersonic nuclear missile to strike Britain and Finland “in just 200 seconds” — and that the weapons could be used to hit the United States as well.

As NATO foreign ministers gathered in Berlin, with discussion about potential applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western military alliance on the agenda, Putin spoke to Finnish leader Sauli Niinisto.

Nijnisto told Putin in the phone conversation that the traditionally non-aligned country “will decide to apply for NATO membership in the coming days.”

Finland and Sweden, also traditionally neutral, are moving toward the applications in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.

Putin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”

Niinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

The exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.

“If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate — to question the existence of this state. This is logical,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. “The Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.”

“If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,” he continued. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA. Well, get in line.”

The Satan-2 is a ballistic missile capable of carrying 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each.

Russia wouldn’t need to move nukes to its European border to carry out its threat, officials boasted.

“We can hit with a Sarmat [known in the West as Satan-2] from Siberia, and even reach the UK,” he said. “And if we strike from Kaliningrad … the hypersonic’s reaching time is 200 seconds – so go ahead, guys.

“On the Finnish border we will have not strategic weapons, but Kinzhal-class, one that will reach Finland in 20 seconds, or even 10 seconds.”

 Poland Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has convened an emergency meeting of the country’s National Security Council after reports that a Russian missile that hit Polish territory killed two civilians.

The emergency meeting was announced by cabinet spokesman Piotr Muller on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon. Muller did not reveal what the committee was due to discuss and did not offer further comment to Reuters news agency.

The committee talks, which will include senior members of Poland’s government and its intelligence services, come following unverified reports that stray Russian missiles intended for Ukraine have hit a Polish village, killing two civilians.

According to Radio ZET, a Polish commercial radio station, “two stray rockets fell in the village of Przewodów in the Lublin province near the border with Ukraine.”

Russian authorities have denied that the missiles that struck Poland came from Russia.

The station further reported that two people had died at the scene. The Polish military, the police, and the prosecutor’s office have been called to the scene.

Military planes are also understood to have been scrambled.

Polish authorities are yet to confirm media reports that Russian missiles were responsible for the explosion but they were substantiated by a senior U.S. intelligence official to the Associated Press news agency on Tuesday evening.

“The causes of this incident are not known at the moment,” said Marcin Lebiedowicz, a spokesman for the Poviat Fire Brigade in Hrubieszów

“We received a report of an explosion in the drying yard. In fact, upon arrival, we confirm that something like this happened. Two people died on the spot. At the moment, we are securing the scene and lighting the area of the action,” he added.

Kurier Lubelski, a regional Polish news outlet from the affected area has attempted numerous times on Tuesday to verify the details with state officials to no avail.

At 7 p.m. local time, the outlet was told by the local mayor’s office: “I can’t say anything about it. However, there is definitely no need to arouse anxiety. Let’s wait for the exact findings of the services.”

At 7.30 .p.m. local time, the news outlet attempted to speak again with Marcin Lebiedowicz for further information on the incident.

“I’m not allowed to give any information at the moment. I suggest contacting other services,” he replied.

The local police department’s spokesperson has not been available for comment to local media, but Voivode of Lublin Lech Sprawka confirmed he was on his way to the accident site.

Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala stated that “If Poland confirms that the missiles also hit its territory, this will be a further escalation by Russia. We stand firmly behind our EU and NATO ally.”

Latvia’s Deputy Prime Minister Artis Pabriks stated that the “criminal Russian regime” had hit Poland with missiles, although it is unclear what evidence he has to back his statement at this time.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said “every inch of NATO territory must be defended.”

Hungarian government spokesperson, Zolan Kovacs, also confirmed via Twitter that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had convened an emergency meeting of Hungary’s Defense Council for Tuesday evening “in response to missiles hitting the territory of Poland.”

 European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Andreas Mogensen has captured a new image of a red sprite, a rare type of electrical discharge rarely seen from Earth.

As part of the Thor-Davis experiment, Danish astronaut Mogensen heads to the International Space Station's (ISS) Cupola observatory module every Saturday to attempt to photograph storms from above. In the first image released by the experiment, which aims to study intense thunderstorms from a better vantage point as well as weather phenomena in high altitude, a Transient Luminous Event (TLE) is seen between 40 and 80 kilometers (25-50 miles) above the Earth.

TLEs, sometimes called ""sprites"", ""red sprites"", or ""red jellyfish sprites"", have been reported by pilots for decades, but were only recorded for the first time in July 1989. They are rarely seen from the surface, which is probably for the best, given the illusion they create of an invading alien space force.

Like regular lightning strikes, the sprites occur following a build-up of electrical charge within clouds. With red sprites, however, the discharge occurs into the Earth's mesosphere up to 80 kilometers (50 miles) above the Earth. The eerie red color occurs as the charge meets nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere.

Mogensen captured the sprite with an ""event camera"", which according to ESA works more like a human eye than a regular camera, sensing changes in contrast rather than capturing an image. An advantage of these cameras is they can produce around 100,000 images a second, while drawing very little power to do so. Among other aims, the study strives to better understand how lightning in the upper atmosphere affects the concentration of greenhouse gases.

“These images taken by Andreas are fantastic,"" Olivier Chanrion, lead scientist for this experiment, told ESA of this first image from it. ""The Davis camera works well and gives us the high temporal resolution necessary to capture the quick processes in the lightning.""",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
76,EN_CC_100156.txt,"Continual growth: 58 villages now utilizing renewables to grow their economies 

 total of 58 villages across the archipelago are harnessing renewable energy to stimulate economic and social activities in their communities through the Village Energy Independence (DEB) program under Pertamina’s Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility (CSER) umbrella.

The DEB program has expanded as of September to another 11 sites, six of these powered through solar power plants (SPPs) that were installed in collaboration with Pertamina New & Renewable Energy (PNRE), a subsidiary that specializes in new and renewable energy.

The six new DEB locations are: Singapure village in Lahat regency, South Sumatra; Tambakharjo subdistrict in Semarang, Central Java; Eka Jaya subdistrict in Jambi province; Tasikharjo district in Tuban regency, East Java; Larangan village in Cirebon, West Java; and Adat Kedonganan village in Badung, Bali. In addition to infrastructure development, the DEB program also empowers communities in accelerating energy equity by utilizing local energy sources to deliver power to remote villages.

Pertamina vice president corporate communication Fadjar Djoko Santoso said Pertamina would continue to provide access to renewables for all Indonesians so they ultimately achieved energy and economic self-reliance.

""We are continuing our journey to provide opportunities and accelerate the energy transition for the public, such as through the DEB program, which can be beneficial in stimulating economic activity,"" Fadjar said.

Tasikharjo village is one tangible example of Pertamina’s support for local economies through the DEB program. The village is using solar energy to power local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), such as Batik Sekar Tanjung, Jahit Sekar Tanjung and Ethical Creative Tasikharjo.

Meanwhile, Tambakharjo subdistrict is using solar photovoltaic (PV) panels to power the activities of the Pujasera Energy Culinary Kampung.

Solar energy is also being harnessed to support a variety of activities in Kedonganan village that impact the region’s community-based economy, including the operation of its reduce, reuse, recycle waste management facility (TPS3R).

Solar PV panels is also used to generate renewable energy in the villages of Eka Jaya, Larangan and Singapure to support the activities of aquaponics, aquaculture and agriculture MSMEs, including a coffee farm, as well as other MSMEs that stimulate economic and social development.

""The use of renewable and environmentally friendly energy, which never runs out, greatly enhances the productivity of coffee bean processing and other business production, early childhood schools and other public institutions, such as Posyandu [integrated health services posts],” said Singapure village head Aristo Hasan.

“This improves the quality of life for residents of Singapure village and also broadens our understanding of environmentally friendly, renewable energy that can help the government mitigate climate change,"" Aristo added.

Since Pertamina launched the DEB program in 2019, the program has generated benefits that include 170,880 watt-peak (Wp) of solar energy, 605,000 cubic meters per year of biogas and methane, 8,000 Wp of microhydropower, 6,500 liters of biodiesel per year and 16,500 Wp of solar-wind hybrid energy.

In addition to its energy impact, the DEB program has also positively impacted 3,201 households, contributing to an estimate of Rp 1.8 billion in added value per year through overall multiplier effect. The program has also contributed to reducing carbon emissions by 565,928 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) per year.

As part of Pertamina’s CSER initiative, the DEB program supports the company's environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) principles. The program is also in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in achieving SDG 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth, and SDG 13 on Climate Action.

Moreover, the DEB program is a concrete action Pertamina is taking to contribute to the government's 2060 net zero emissions goal.

 by Mac Slavo, SHTF Plan:

Russia is preparing for a war with NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the West. The preparations are for a “long-term confrontation”.

A growing number of Western rulers have also warned of a military threat from Russia to countries along the eastern flank of NATO, calling for Europe to get prepared by rearming.

The chief of the intelligence service said the assessment was based on Russian plans to double the number of forces stationed along its border with NATO members Finland and the Baltic States of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. “Russia has chosen a path which is a long-term confrontation … and the Kremlin is probably anticipating a possible conflict with NATO within the next decade or so,” Kaupo Rosin told reporters at the release of Estonia’s national security threats report, according to a report by The New York Post.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Rosin claimed that a military attack by Russia is “highly unlikely” in the short term, partly because Russia has to keep troops in Ukraine, and that would be unlikely if the Russian buildup of forces was matched in Europe. “If we are not prepared, the likelihood (of a military Russian attack) would be much higher than without any preparation,” Rosin added.

Estonia and the other Baltic States have increased their military spending to over 2% of the value of their economies after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and NATO allies have raised their presence in those countries.

Germany plans to have 4,800 combat-ready troops in the region by 2027, in its first permanent foreign deployment since World War Two, and Rosin said NATO and its allies were moving in the right direction to counter the Russian threat. –The New York Post.

Russia has repeatedly warned that it will go to war with NATO if the West’s weapons defeat Russia, or lethal aid is sent to Ukraine. One could argue that the West has crossed that line, but Russia has yet to follow through with an attack on NATO.

Russia Warns NATO A Nuclear War Will Ensue If Western Weapons Defeat Russia

The bad news is that Russia’s ability to provide ammunition to its troops is continuing to outweigh Ukraine’s.

 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who visited European countries last week, wanted to make a solidarity visit to Israel alongside U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, but was turned down by Israel.

More stories:

According to sources familiar with the request, Israel informed the Jewish leader that ""it's not the right time"", but he might visit later. Zelensky wishes to express support for Israel, but due to his own constraints - as Ukraine has been under attack from Russia for nearly two years - he cannot make it to Israel on a ""standalone trip"" and is expected to include Israel as part of a future European tour.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian police, spanning its many units including the special forces, crafted a heartfelt tribute to the State of Israel through a video featuring officers from across their ranks.

""The year is 2023. Israel was brutally attacked by terrorists. During the attack, hundreds of civilians, military personnel, including police officers were killed,” members of the Patrol Police of Ukraine say in the video.

“Patrol officers express their deepest respect and gratitude to police and military officers of Israel. To those who were the first to join the battle and became the adamant defenders of their citizens.

“We are deeply saddened by the deaths and losses that Israel has suffered as a result of this brutal aggression. The Patrol Police of Ukraine stands side by side with Israel at this important moment. And we express our most sincere solidarity to all police and military families of Israel. May our mutual friendship and support help Israel to overcome these turbulent times and return to peace and security.”

 Putin Deploys Troops Along Finland Border In Response To NATO Accession

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in fresh remarks that Finland and Sweden’s entry into NATO are ""a meaningless step"" but that in response Moscow will still deploy troops and ""systems of destruction"" to the Finnish border after Finland joined the alliance.

""Frankly speaking, I don’t understand why they need this. This is an absolutely meaningless step from the point of view of ensuring their own national interests,"" Putin said.

""We generally had ideal relations with Finland, simply ideal. We did not have a single claim against each other, especially territorial ones,"" Putin continued, before saying that Finland's NATO accession was really born out of a desire to ""join the Western club"".

""We didn't even have troops; we removed all the troops from there, from the Russian-Finnish border,"" he said. ""However, it is up to them to decide. That's what they decided. But we didn't have troops there, now we will.""

Finland became the 31st member of the alliance last April, but it was on Monday that Sweden formally became the 32nd at a flag raising ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said expressly at the ceremony that his country abandoned historic neutrality as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""The Russian, brutal, full-scale invasion against Ukraine united Sweden behind the conclusion that a full-fledged NATO membership is the only reasonable choice,"" Kristersson said.

On Wednesday soaring tensions between Russia and Nordic countries were on display during new remarks of Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo.

He claimed in a speech before European Parliament that Moscow is preparing for a ""long conflict with the West"" and ""represents a permanent and essential military threat to Europe.""

 The Eurocrats Fear That Fico's Attempted Assassination Will Influence Next Month's Elections

Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned last week that Russia will ramp up its meddling ahead of next month’s parliamentary elections, which preceded European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova assessing that they’d be a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience. This speculation is nothing new, but what’s different this time around is that the attempted assassination of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be on every voter’s mind, thus likely influencing the outcome.

The preceding hyperlinked analysis argued that fake news was responsible for radicalizing the pro-Ukrainian suspect into thinking that shooting his premier was a legitimate form of protest against what he’d been misled by the media into believing was his “pro-Russian dictator with blood on his hands”. This black swan event might have served the short-term interests of that leader’s many enemies, but the blowback could be considerable if it leads to a conservative landslide during next month’s elections.

Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban predicted that the upcoming vote will influence the direction of war and peace in Europe, and while the European Parliament admittedly can’t do much in terms of shaping the NATO-Russian proxy war in Ukraine, it could still exert positive pressure if conservatives win. It’s with that in mind that Eurocrats like von der Leyen and Jourova are fearmongering about Russian meddling since they want to preemptively discredit this potential outcome.

To be sure, the first of those two had no idea that an assassination attempt would be made against Fico the day after she shared her earlier mentioned warning, but the second’s assessment about the upcoming elections being a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience came some days later. Instead of speaking vaguely about alleged Russian meddling, the Eurocrats are now honing their information warfare narrative to muddle the conversation about Fico’s attempted assassination and its political aftermath.

The targeted audience is the unclear number of on-the-fence voters who might usually lean liberal but have recently begun to sympathize with some conservative positions on issues like Ukraine. Last week’s incident was driven by the liberal media’s fake news about the Slovak leader, which might influence some of these voters to give the more narratively responsible conservatives their support. In an attempt to desperately prevent this, the Eurocrats want them think that it would be doing Russia’s bidding.

If the European Parliamentary elections have absolutely no effect on anything, then they wouldn’t care who votes for whom, but the outcome will clearly at the very least have a major impact on popular perceptions and could lead to cascading consequences like more anti-war protests across the bloc. It’s for this reason that the Eurocrats and their media allies, including those being promoted by state-run Ukrainian outlets like this one here, are pushing the abovementioned information warfare narrative.

The growing gap between liberals and conservatives over Ukraine, which is foreign policy issue that Fico was most closely associated with, is naturally occurring as a result of their polar opposite worldviews and not due to Russian meddling. It’s so emotive and significant that some from both sides have become single-issue voters who’ll cast their ballots purely based on candidates’ positions towards this. Attempting to discredit this trend as being due to Russian meddling is disrespectful to democracy.",1,"['URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Distrust towards Media']","['URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Ukrainian media cannot be trusted']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
81,EN_UA_017310.txt,"Jake Sullivan hints US won’t replenish controversial cluster munitions to Ukraine 

 The Biden administration has no plans to replenish the stockpile of controversial cluster bombs it’s sending to Ukraine, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.

“Our current plan is not to replenish that stockpile,” Sullivan told NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” .

“It is rather to build up the capacity to produce the unitary round of the 155, the non-cluster munition round of ammunition,” he said.

Earlier this month, President Biden opted to send the divisive ammunition to Ukraine — and publicly acknowledged he was prompted to do so because the military is running low on 155 mm artillery ammunition rounds.

A chorus of critics — both abroad and at home — decried the decision, citing the grave dangers cluster munitions pose to civilians given their dud rates.

Sullivan echoed Biden’s defense — that the US must supply Ukraine with adequate firepower.

“We began that process months ago was we anticipated the need for continuing supply Ukraine, but it takes time and that is why we need a bridge from today,” he said, referencing steps to boost production of 155 mm rounds.

“We need to ensure that Ukraine has the necessary supply of ammunition to a few months down the road, when we believe we can supply enough of the unitary round to meet Ukraine’s defense needs.”

Cluster bombs are prohibited by over 100 countries across the world, including multiple NATO members.

Military officials claim the cluster bombs being sent to Ukraine have a dud rate of around 2.35% or less — markedly lower than the roughly 30% and 40% dud rate estimated for Russia’s cluster munitions being deployed against Ukraine.

The dud rate refers to the likelihood of the bomblets in the cluster munitions not exploding after being deployed.

Bomblets that are duds may detonate long after being deployed.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin previously committed to having the US help Ukraine scour and clean up duds from those munitions.

Sullivan insisted dissemination of the controversial bombs doesn’t undercut US’ “moral authority.”

“Our moral authority and Ukraine’s moral authority in this conflict comes from the fact that we are supporting a country under brutal, vicious attack by its neighbor with missiles and bombs raining down in its cities, killing its civilians, destroying its schools, it’s churches, its hospitals,” he said.

“The idea that providing Ukraine with a weapon in order for them to be able to defend their homeland, protect their civilians is somehow a challenge for moral authority I find questionable,” he added.

Last week, NATO held a summit in Vilinius, lithuania, and ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit there, he slammed NATO allies for their position on admitting the war-torn nation into the powerful alliance.

Sullivan reiterated the US position that Ukraine can receive admittance once it wraps up the necessary reforms to meet the alliance’s democracy requirements.

“We could have said it more clearly,” Sullivan said, alluding to a NATO communique. “Ukraine’s future will be in NATO. Period full stop. That was a single, clear sentence.

82,EN_UA_103403.txt,"Russia Stages Major Airstrike on Ukraine; One Missile Enters Polish Airspace 

 KYIV—Russia struck critical infrastructure in Ukraine’s western region of Lviv with missiles early on March 24, Kyiv said, in a major airstrike that saw one Russian cruise missile briefly fly into Polish airspace, according to Warsaw.

Moscow launched 57 missiles and drones in the attack that also targeted Kyiv, two days after the largest aerial bombardment of Ukraine’s energy system in more than two years of full-scale war, Kyiv said.

“There were two preliminary hits on the same critical infrastructure facility that the occupiers targeted at night,” Lviv’s regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

The strike used Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, which are harder to shoot down, he added, without identifying the facility.

The energy ministry said equipment caught fire when a critical energy facility in the Lviv region was attacked, causing it to lose power. It was unclear whether they were talking about the same facility.

Air defences destroyed 18 of 29 inbound missiles and 25 of 28 attack drones, the Ukranian air force said.

There were almost no details about what had been damaged, but the targeting of critical infrastructure could indicate that Russia is trying to keep up pressure on the energy system after its strikes caused widespread blackouts on March 22.

The energy ministry said that Ukraine, which has been exporting power in recent weeks, had sharply increased imports of electricity and stopped exports on March 24 after attacks on the energy system.

Several explosions rang out in Kyiv in the early hours as air defences destroyed about a dozen missiles over the capital and in its vicinity, according to Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration.

There was only minor damage from the attack, he said.

Small groups of people huddled for safety underground in a central Kyiv metro station in the early hours, some of them sleeping on camping mats.

Moscow has been pounding Ukraine for days in attacks portrayed by Moscow as revenge for Ukrainian attacks that were conducted during Russia’s presidential election.

The wreckage of a downed Kh-55 cruise missile was found in a Kyiv park, officials said.

“For the third pre-dawn morning this week, all of Ukraine is under an air alert and has been advised to seek shelter,” U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink posted on social media platform X.

Polish AirspacePoland’s armed forces said a Russian cruise missile launched at the region of Lviv had violated Poland’s airspace.

“The object entered Polish space near the town of Oserdow [Lublin Voivodeship] and stayed there for 39 seconds,” it said on X. “During the entire flight, it was observed by military radar systems.”

 U.S., Europe plan for any cutoff of Russian natural gas over Ukraine crisis

U.S. and European officials are coordinating with natural gas suppliers around the globe to cushion the impact if Russia were to cut off energy supplies in the conflict over Ukraine, Biden administration officials say.

The U.S. and its European allies have promised punishing economic and political sanctions if Russia moves its military into Ukraine, but worry about repercussions for Europeans from any such sanctions, including Russia potentially cutting off delivery of its natural gas to Europe at the height of winter.

Putin has deployed roughly 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border for weeks, sparking a diplomatic crisis for Europe and the United States. He denies any intention of invasion.

Any U.S. and European measures against Russia in the event of an invasion “also have consequences for others, including us,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in remarks as part of a lecture series Monday night.

“There’s a cost imposed on everyone,” Blinken said. “But we have done a tremendous amount of work to mitigate any effects of sanctions on those ... imposing them, as well as any retaliatory action that Russia might take.”

Two senior U.S. administration officials separately briefed reporters Tuesday about efforts by Biden’s national security team to deal with any knock-on effects from sanctions. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deliberations.

Western embassies are also moving some of their staff out of Kyiv

If needed, Europe would look to natural gas supplies in North Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the United States. The effort would require “rather smaller volumes from a multitude of sources” to make up for a Russian cutoff, according to one of the officials.

The Biden administration has acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin has high tolerance for the damage to Russia’s economy that would come with sanctions. But officials said the “start high, stay high” approach to penalties that they have told Moscow they would take could influence Putin’s calculations.

One official said sanctions could spur inflation in Russia “in the mid-teens” and even, according to the second official, a deep recession that would not help Putin “win hearts and minds” among his compatriots.

In the U.S., a group representing large industrial energy users and manufacturers that oppose export of U.S. natural gas appeared open to considering an exception for helping Europeans weather any possible cutoff of Russian natural gas.

Ukraine’s leaders are seeking to reassure their jittery citizens that an invasion from neighboring Russia is not imminent, despite a troop buildup.

The group, Industrial Energy Consumers of America, has asked Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to limit exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Surging U.S. exports have helped drive up natural gas prices, the group argues.

Paul Cicio, the group’s president, told reporters on Tuesday that his group had not taken a position on how the U.S. should respond to tensions between Russia and Europe over natural gas.

“My own personal view is that if Europe needs gas, the U.S. should be there to supply our allies,″ Cicio said, noting that China is the top recipient of U.S. gas exports.

“Do we have capacity to supply our allies? Absolutely,″ Cicio said. “But maybe we don’t have capacity to ship to China. So we need to be sensitive to the political crisis. It’s a real serious thing.”",1,['URW: Negative Consequences for the West'],['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
84,EN_UA_102655.txt,"BIOWARFARE ON AMERICANS: RFK Jr. says CIA was directly involved in funding COVID research for Wuhan lab 

 by Ethan Huff, Natural News:

The reason why the Biden regime could not care less about even attempting to punish communist China for covering up the “lab leak” that many believe occurred at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, allowing the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to escape, is because doing so would expose the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its bioweapons program.

These and other statements were made by 2024 presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a recent interview with Fox News‘ Jesse Watters. Kennedy suggested that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is also involved in funding the bioweapons programs from which COVID appears to have originated.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

“I think the CIA was involved certainly in this research,” Kennedy told Watters and viewers. “They were funding it through USAID. And NIH, I think, in the end gave about $26 million in funding to the Wuhan lab. But USAID, which was functioning as the CIA surrogate, gave over $64 million. The Pentagon also gave a lot of money.”

Kennedy would go on in the interview to blast Tony Fauci, the former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), for his complicity in unleashing hell on the world that resulted in tens of millions of needless deaths.

“I think he caused a lot of injury,” Kennedy, who wrote an entire book about the subject, said of Fauci. “I think that he particularly, by withholding early treatment from Americans, we racked up the highest death count in the world. We only have 4.2 percent of the globe’s population but we had 16 percent of the COVID deaths in this country and that was from bad policy.”

RFK Jr. says vaccines do, in fact, cause autism

Unlike the United States, many other countries allowed their citizens to access tried-and-true remedies for coronaviruses such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), both of which were maligned or even banned in the U.S. as “fake news.”

“There were countries that did the opposite of what we did that provided ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, other early treatments to their population, and had 1/200th of our death rate,” Kennedy said.

Concerning the subject of vaccines, Kennedy clarified for Watters and viewers his longtime position that poison jabs do, in fact, cause autism – though that does not necessarily mean that he opposes vaccines being legal, just so long as sound science is able to back them.

“I do believe that autism comes from vaccines,” Kennedy revealed. “But I think most of the things people believe about my opinions about vaccines are wrong. I, you know, all I have said about vaccines is we should have good science.”

“We should have the same kind of testing, placebo-controlled trials that we have for every other medication. Vaccines are exempt from pre-licensing placebo-controlled trials. There’s no way that anybody can tell the risk profile of those products or even the relative benefits of those products before they’re mandated, and we should have that kind of testing.”

Be sure to watch the interview with Kennedy below:

One commenter noted that he agrees with Kennedy in that COVID was “cultivated” and “intentionally released at just the right time, one year before a U.S. presidential election.”

“It was perfect timing for Biden’s campaign to use it against Trump while they were working hard in the background to hide all of Biden’s corruption,” this person added. “I think they are also funding labs in Ukraine as well. That and NATO membership is one of the biggest reasons Russia invaded.”",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A FORMER football star has joined an army unit of Russian hooligans on the frontline in Ukraine.

It comes as the battalion - led by an ultra dubbed The Spaniard - steps up recruitment in a desperate bid to boost ranks as Russian invaders continue to meet stiff Ukrainian resistance.

The brigade, named Espanola, is filled with thugs from the terraces and has now been given special status among armed forces backing Vladimir Putin.

Hooligans were recruited too, but now the unit is classed as a separate private military company, with the go-ahead to expand recruitment.

The ultras are urged: ""Get into the coolest adventures of your life with a real chance to come back alive from these scrapes.”

They are promised a “decent reward” for turning their violent instincts on Ukraine.

More on Russia

Former Russian international footballer Andrey Solomatin, 47, has signed up.

He played for Moscow clubs CSKA and Lokomotiv.

Stanislav Orlov, commander of Española private military company, said: “We were volunteers, then part of the DPR [Donetsk People’s Republic] forces.

“Recently we managed to get separate status. So now we do not belong to any battalions or divisions.""

Most read in Football

Orlov, whose call sign is ""Spaniard"", said they had been given approval to create a separate battalion, Espanola.

The hooligans’ battalion is 550 strong, including 100 operators of kamikaze drones used to attack Ukraine, he said.

The fighters say they are being equipped by football supporters from across Russia.

Orlov said: “There are a huge number of them.

“All over Russia, in fact - in different cities there are different football teams.

“We tell them what we need [and they provide it].""

Five years ago, Putin’s regime desperately tried to crackdown on Russian hooligans and ultras - using an FSB crackdown to stop them ruining the FIFA World Cup, which Putin hosted.

In 2016, Russian hooligans were in pitch battles with English fans at the UEFA Euro tournament in France.

Now they are formalised as an armed force, and seen as heroes.

Espanola is currently recruiting “stormtroopers”, scout-saboteurs, snipers, drone operators, electronic warfare and air defence operators, portable ground reconnaissance station operators, anti-tank guided missile operators, anti aircraft specialists, communications specialists, mechanic-drivers, and medics.

Would-be fighters are told they will “take a quick but deep course of study in all directions with a real opportunity - or rather the need - to become a ‘universal soldier’.”

They will “become a real military man and benefit the Motherland without delay”.

And the stadium fighters will “get access and learn how to work with the most modern weapons, equipment and technologies"".

Sniper detachments “are provided with all the most advanced technologies — this applies to transport, equipment, and of course [guns].”

Recruits are told they “may not be hooligans, but they should be close to us in spirit and comply with the main principles of Española in life”.

Recruitment sessions have been held in Moscow and St Petersburg, as well as other cities.

They boast recruits from the hooligan armies of clubs like CSKA, Zenit, Spartak, Torpedo and Lokomotiv and the notorious Orel Butchers.

Several are known to have died so far in the war, including CSKA Moscow fan Maxim Shmanin, 44.

 Molotov Cocktail Attack On Russian Embassy In Moldova On Last Day Of Election

Sunday is the final day of three days of presidential elections in Russia. Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of deceased opposition activist Alexei Navalny, is urging mass protests against President Putin as he stands of the verge of winning another six year term as president, an outcome quite obvious to all observers. She's calling on Russians to disrupt the final day of voting in what's been dubbed ""noon against Putin"".

While some sporadic minor incidents at polling stations have been reported, there has been a major incident in the small country of Moldova which borders Ukraine. Moldovan police have detained a man who attacked the Russian embassy with two Molotov cocktails as voting was underway there.

""A man threw two containers of flammable substances over the fence of the Russian Embassy in Chisinau,"" police said in a statement. A 54-year-old Moldovan who described himself as also having Russian citizenship was immediately detained after after hurling the Molotov cocktails.

There were no reports of injuries or damage to the embassy, and police said an investigation is ongoing. ""He justified his action by some dissatisfaction he has with the actions of the Russian authorities,"" authorities said.

Moldova has been scene of controversy and friction especially after Russia allowed the opening of several polling stations in breakaway Transnistria, which the Moldovan government has fiercely protested.

Reuters noted days ago that ""A senior official in ex-Soviet Moldova said on Wednesday Moscow was breaking laws by printing ballot papers in the separatist region of Transnistria ahead of this week's Russian presidential election.""

""Moldova's pro-European authorities have already summoned the Russian ambassador to complain about a decision to open six polling stations in the pro-Russian enclave,"" the report continued. ""The central government said the move broke an agreement to allow voting only at a single polling station at the Russian embassy in Chisinau.""

The United States recently become more vocal in defending Moldova's territorial integrity, and has condemned what the Biden administration has called Moscow's 'interference' in the Eastern European nation's sovereignty.

Last summer, Moldova expelled 45 Russian diplomats and embassy staff members from the country ""over numerous unfriendly actions"" as tensions reached near breaking point over the war in neighboring Ukraine and the Transnistria issue. As for Russia's election, Kremlin authorities have said Ukraine is engaged in cross-border attacks on polling stations and in annexed regions of Ukraine.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
87,EN_UA_010735.txt,"Russia's Infrastructure Attacks Could Impact Ukraine's Neighbors: Official 

 Russia's latest attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure could impact the Eastern European nation's neighbors, a key Ukrainian energy official said on Tuesday.

Nearly nine months after Russia invaded Ukraine, Moscow has continued to ramp up its attacks against Ukrainian infrastructure in recent weeks, targeting cities across Ukraine including the capital city of Kyiv.

Despite the vast size of the Russian military, its troops have struggled to achieve substantial gains in Ukraine. Meanwhile, throughout the fall, Kyiv has retaken control of formerly occupied territories, most recently recapturing control of Kherson, a major city in the nation's southern region.

Concerns about attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure have grown as winter approaches, and these attacks threaten to leave millions of Ukrainians without power throughout the winter, which could see dangerously low temperatures.

On Tuesday, Russia hit Ukraine with its latest attack on its infrastructure, which Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko described as the ""most massive shelling"" since the war began on February 24, 2022.

""Today again Russia strikes large-scale missile strikes on energy facilities. This is the most massive shelling of the energy system since the beginning of the war,"" he wrote in a Facebook post. ""This attack can have an impact not only on the energy system of Ukraine, but also on the energy systems of some of our neighbors.""

Galushchenko said the attack hit Ukraine's generators and electricity transmission system, describing the attack as ""another attempt of terrorist revenge"" in which Russia tried to ""inflict maximum damage on our energy system on the eve of winter.""

One Ukrainian neighbor reported outages due to the attack.

Moldovan Minister of Infrastructure and Regional Development Andrei Spînu wrote in a Telegram post that the Russian attacks led to power outages across the country. The lines did not suffer damage due to the attack but were disconnected due to a safety measure.

""As a result of Russia's bombing of the Ukrainian energy system in the last hour, one of the power lines that provide electricity transport for our country was disconnected in automatic mode (automatic load shedding according to frequency). This has led to massive power outages across the country,"" he wrote.

Moldovan authorities restored power for most of its residents later Tuesday, but Spînu warned that Russian attacks against Ukraine could lead to further outages.

""Russian aggression against Ukraine directly affects our country as well. The risks of power outages remain high. Any bombing by Russia against Ukrainian power plants may lead to a repeat of today's situation,"" he wrote.

Newsweek reached out to the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy for comment.

 FACT CHECK: Is NASA Planning To Blast Ice Particles Into The Atmosphere To Fight Climate Change?

A video shared on Facebook claims the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is purportedly planning to inject ice particles into the atmosphere to fight climate change.

Verdict: False

The claim is false. The idea was proposed via a study conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and serves as a collaboration between NOAA and NASA, but has not been put into practice. A NASA spokesperson denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.

Fact Check:

A “fresh group of NASA astronauts” who just completed basic training will participate in the first Boeing Starliner test launch in May, according to Space.com. The launch will be a week-long mission, the outlet reported.

In the Facebook video, an unnamed male claims NASA is purportedly planning to inject ice particles into the atmosphere to fight climate change based on an article from Unilad. The video, which originally stems from TikTok, has garnered over 1,000 views as of writing.

The claim is false, however. The Unilad article, published on Mar. 1, 2024, makes it clear that injecting ice particles into the atmosphere is only a “proposed solution” and has not been put into practice. The article also indicates the proposal is a collaboration between NASA and NOAA and references a recent piece from the Daily Mail that cites a study conducted by NOAA physicist Josh Schwarz.

According to the study, the concept is called intentional stratospheric dehydration and “would involve dispersing small particles (known as ice nuclei) into high altitude regions of the atmosphere that are both very cold and super-saturated in water vapor. These nuclei would increase the formation of ice crystals that otherwise would not have formed.”

“This ‘[ISD]’ strategy would not counteract a large fraction of the forcing from carbon dioxide but may contribute to a portfolio of climate interventions by acting with different time and length scales of impact and risk than other interventions that are already under consideration,” Schwarz and his co-authors wrote in the same study.

Likewise, Check Your Fact found no credible news reports to support the claim. In fact, the opposite is true. Both Lead Stories and USA Today debunked the claim in Mar. 8 and Mar. 15 articles, respectively. (RELATED: No, 80 Percent Of Texas’ ‘Cattle Grazing Land’ Was Not Destroyed By Recent Fires)

Additionally, the claim is neither referenced on NASA’s website nor its verified social media accounts. NOAA also has not publicly commented on the claim.

NASA Spokesperson Allard Beutel denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.

“This is an unfortunate mischaracterization of a study done by another agency. As this was a study, NASA is not planning to inject ice into the stratosphere,” Beutel said.

89,EN_CC_100037.txt,"Majority of Americans Believe ‘Climate Change’ Hoax but Oppose Ending Fossil Fuels 

 Unfortunately, a new poll shows that the majority of Americans believe to some extent the unscientific climate doom propaganda that has been consistently wrong for half a century. The good news: most Americans still oppose ditching fossil fuels and gas cars altogether.

Pew Research Center published the results of its new survey on June 28. While climate alarmists’ predictions have been consistently and wildly wrong for 50 years now, with one unscientific claim after another proven false, the media, government, and institutions continue pounding in the narrative — and with some apparently considerable effects:

- 74% of Americans say they support the country’s participation in international efforts to reduce the effects of climate change.

- 67% of U.S. adults prioritize the development of alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen power over increasing the production of fossil fuel energy sources.

I have previously explained in more detail how “green” energy is actually toxic for the environment, besides being inefficient and unprofitable. In other words, “green” energy is a lose-lose option. Solar panels and wind turbines have killed billions of birds, for instance, and offshore wind turbines can be deadly for whales (not to mention, wind turbines and solar panels generate plenty of toxic waste). And those “green” electric vehicles (EV)? EV batteries, which have to be replaced every few years, are very toxic to manufacture and dispose of.

Perhaps Americans are starting to realize that:

[Pew:] Less than half of the public (40%) favors phasing out the production of gas-powered cars and trucks. Support for this policy is 7 percentage points lower than it was two years ago. And underscoring the strong feelings big changes to American life can engender, 45% say they would feel upset if gas-powered cars were phased out; fewer than half as many (21%) would feel excited.

You mean Americans don’t want to switch to unreliable electric cars that have to depend upon an already strained grid? No way!

If Pew is to be believed, however, Americans are a little too credulous of the narrative that carbon is about to make this planet into a ball of fire. (Spoiler: it isn’t):

- 76% favor providing a tax credit to businesses that develop carbon capture technologies and 70% support taxing corporations based on their carbon emissions.

- 61% favor requiring power plants to eliminate all carbon emissions by the year 2040

One very simple truth that the climate alarmists don’t want you to know is that carbon is absolutely essential for life on Earth. Indeed, increased carbon actually helps plants — including food crops — thrive. Human, plant, or animal, we need carbon. So drastically reducing carbon could hurt humans and devastate crops and plants.

By the way, a recent study found that CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are too low to cause global warming. That seems like important information, but don’t expect to see it in the mainstream media.

It is disappointing that so many Americans believe to some degree in the climate hoax after all these years. But it is encouraging that Americans are not falling hook, line, and sinker for some of the lies around electric vehicles and fossil fuels.

We don’t need to give up our cars to save the planet. It’s all just a political deception.

 The Wagner mercenary group’s head Yevgeny Prigozhin has announced that he will withdraw his troops from Bakhmut by next month and transfer control to the Russian army. The announcement comes just two days after he claimed that the troops have successfully captured the key Ukrainian city.

The claims were however refuted by Kyiv who said that it is hanging on to a corner of the eastern Ukrainian city and that battles are ongoing.

“Wagner will leave Artemovsk from May 25 to June 1,” Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin said in an audio recording on Telegram.

Bakhmut was previously known as Artemovsk to honour a Soviet revolutionary before Ukraine renamed it.

Before planning the transfer of control, Prigozhin readied troops on the western outskirts of the city.

He said, “If the ministry of defence does not have enough personnel, we have thousands of generals.”

Prigozhin has poured scathing criticism on Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and army chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, accusing them of being incompetent and causing Moscow’s large-scale losses in the conflict in Ukraine.

Wagner fighters have spearheaded Russia’s storming of Bakhmut and Prigozhin’s influence has risen hugely during Moscow’s Ukraine offensive.

The Russian military claimed on Saturday that it has successfully captured the much-contested eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.

The Wagner Group led the all-out offensive in the city. Earlier in the day, Prigozhin said that his troops had finally pushed the Ukrainians out of the last built-up area inside the city.

The Russian defence ministry said in a statement, “As a result of offensive actions by Wagner assault units, supported by artillery and aviation of the Southern Group of Forces, the liberation of Artyomovsk has been completed.”

“Vladimir Putin congratulated the assault units of Wagner as well as all servicemen of units of the Russian armed forces who provided them with the necessary support and flank cover, on the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk (the Soviet-era name for Bakhmut),” TASS agency quoted the Kremlin saying.

American Interventionism Is Dangerous,

But Is It Worse than the Alternative?

I’ve been here before, only I didn’t know it. When I born in the summer of 1984, the world had already escaped nuclear holocaust on a number of occasions, but the biggest close calls happened in the early 1980s, with one of them so close to a Soviet-American thermonuclear war that the Soviet officer who de-escalated the event is dubbed “the man that saved the world” – Stanislav Petrov.

Like all incredible lucky stories, Stanislav was called to duty at the last second, because the officer originally assigned to the shift was sick.

Suddenly, his screen was filled with notices of nuclear warheads headed to the Soviet Union from the United States, and he had to decide whether or not to call Moscow ASAP and alert them that in five minutes, the entire country would be obliterated!

But something stopped him… he began reasoning that had the United States started on the path of nuclear war, they’d launch hundreds of missiles, not just a few, and decided to hold off and learn that no other station was reporting anything.

Subsequently, he learned that this was a new satellite detection system that was totally useless, and that even flares from the clouds and sun could make it beep.

Basically, he found out that the latest Soviet air defenses were garbage and was actually fired, instead of hailed for his deep thinking.

I was born the year after Stanislav Petrov saved the world, including my own parents.

Now, the Russians and NATO members are fighting a proxy war in Ukraine. France is ready to send troops to Ukraine already and, instead of having the country join NATO, it will essentially turn Ukraine into a buffer zone between Russia and the rest of Europe, but president Biden, of all people, is the one blocking it.

No wonder precious metals are soaring, but do I agree with hedge fund managers that it is overvalued?

Courtesy: Zerohedge.com

In my opinion, gold is not overvalued, and its fair price is in the neighborhood of $2,582, whereas silver’s is around $37.

In the next few weeks, Biden will realize that France entering Ukraine, while showing that Washington is playing second fiddle to an emerging superpower in Europe. Washington stands to gain much from this, as it will drastically shift from policing the world to coalizing with other nations and keeping its influence, while isolating more and more, which is a very bi-partisan strategy.

If this happens, a head-on confrontation between France and Russia will send the human race back to the WW2 era, and I submit to you that French troops will then be reinforced by German, Polish and Italian ones.

Ukraine, in effect, will be like the Berlin Wall, separating Russia from Europe proper.

If you’re shaking your head in disbelief, just know that during Carter’s term in office, a 40c-worth chip malfunctioned once, prompting the screens to show that 2,000 Soviet warheads were en route to major American cities. Only five minutes later, when Carter was about to be notified and we were minutes away from launching a counterstrike, the operations room called to say it was a faulty chip!!!

Yeah, own silver… it’s going higher.

 Ukraine's Fate Will Be Decided In Coming Year, Top Zelensky Aide Admits

In surprisingly blunt words, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the coming year will essentially decide the fate of Ukraine and its war with Russia.

""A turning point in the war is approaching,"" Andrii Yermak, who serves as chief of staff for the Office of the President of Ukraine, said Monday. ""The next year will be decisive in this regard."" He issued the words while appealing for more urgent aid from Washington in an address to the hawkish DC-based Hudson Institute think tank.

Yermak sought to assure the audience that Zelensky has ""a clear plan"" forward even as Western media has by and large soured on Kiev's prospects for success. Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.

He described advancing plans for ""the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.""

But he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more ""weapons right now""--describing that ""Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.""

Without doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as ""the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.""

So now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the ""bad news"" of late out of Ukraine.

Yermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be ""charity"" but is instead an ""investment"" in America's ""global leadership.""

He further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. ""We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,"" Yermak said.

 NUSA DUA – The European Council president urged global powers Tuesday to intensify pressure on Russia over its war against Ukraine, including Moscow's biggest supporter, China, saying that this week's meeting of the world's largest economies was crucial to stopping Moscow's push ""to use food and energy as weapons.”

Charles Michel, speaking to reporters on the first day of the Group of 20 meeting in Bali, said the nine-month war waged by Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has disrupted lives across the world, as food and energy prices surge and economies stagnate.

“Russia’s war impacts us all, no matter where we live, from Europe to Africa or the Middle East, and the single best way to end the acute crisis in food and energy is for Russia to end this senseless war and to respect the U.N. charter,” Michel said. “The Kremlin has decided to weaponize food, driving up hunger, poverty and instability.”

Europe, Michel said, is working to help Ukraine, a big food exporter before the war, increase its shipments, and is also trying to address disruptions in fertilizer supplies and rising prices. EU sanctions against Russia, he said, don’t target agricultural products, even though Russia has imposed restrictions on its own food and fertilizer products.

“This is not a battle (of) Russia against the Western part of the world. It’s a battle for the U.N. charter. It’s a battle for the international law. It's a battle for the idea that this is not acceptable to try to change by force internationally recognized borders.”

Michel said he had no plans to meet with the most senior Russian present in Bali, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

China, the world's second biggest economy, has largely refrained from public criticism of Russia’s war, although Beijing has avoided direct support of the Russians, such as supplying arms. Michel avoided direct criticism of China when asked if Beijing has shown any signs of changing its steadfast support of Russia in recent days.

Instead, he said that the G-20 meeting Tuesday and Wednesday was important to convince all nations present “to put more pressure on Russia.""

After a meeting Monday between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden said the two leaders discussed Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and “reaffirmed our shared belief” that the use or even the threat of nuclear weapons is “totally unacceptable” — a reference to Moscow’s thinly veiled threats to use atomic weapons as its invasion of Ukraine has faltered.

Michel said that Europe must make sure that it creates a different economic and political relationship with China than the one it did with Russia.

“We don't want to make the same mistakes maybe we make with Russia on fossil fuels,” which Europe was very dependent on, “with China, (where) we don't want to be too dependent for the innovative technology that we need today and that we need more in the future. That's why it's important to rebalance the relationship,” Michel said.",1,['URW: Overpraising the West'],['URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Putin may ABANDON siege of Kyiv and try to blitz other cities into submission after losing thousands of troops

MAD Vlad Putin may abandon plans to capture Kyiv as countless Russian soldiers would be killed, spooks now believe.

Spies say the death toll of an all-out assault on Ukraine's capital may even be too much for the evil Kremlin tyrant to stomach.

A Western official said: ""An ill-judged ground assault on a city as well prepared as Kyiv, with really determined and committed defenders, would be a fairly costly business.

""And I think there comes a point where even Russia has to count the cost of casualties.

They said Putin's forces were getting ""bogged down"" around the outskirts of Kyiv after suffering ambushes by heroic Ukrainians.

As many as 7,000 Russian troops have been killed in the bloody fighting so far as Putin's battleplan continues to fall apart.

Spies fear the crazed despot could resort to even more brutal firepower that could blow entire cities to smithereens.

A western official said there was ""big concern"" he could create another Grozny, the Chechan city pummelled in the 1990s.

Soldiers fed Putin's lie that they would be welcomed as liberators are struggling to occupy cities because of resistance.

The official said the plan was to ""walk in, decapitate the local leadership and receive the adulation of a welcoming population"".

They added Russia would likely resort to ""brutalise the population"" and ""destroy"" the cities to save face.

Failure to completely capture a single Ukrainian is humiliating Putin who has lost four top generals and has not ""achieved a strategic breakthrough at any point"".

His legendary paratroopers have also been picked off by plucky Ukrainians.

Taras Kuzio, an Associate Research Fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, says dozens of Russian paratroopers were killed in their doomed bid to take Hostomel airport.

95,EN_CC_100235.txt,"Mitigating climate change brings economic benefits 

 Editor's note: Jin Jun is an associate professor at the School of Management, Zhejiang University. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Mitigating climate change fosters a cooperative and symbiotic relationship between carbon neutrality, sustainable economic and social development, which is mainly manifested in the following two aspects.

On the one hand, actions to mitigate climate change and improve the ecological environment can yield direct and indirect economic benefits for socio-economic development. Green and sustainable development can propel the growth of society, from enterprises and businesses to regions and whole nations.

(1) New innovative entrepreneurial opportunities and job positions emerge in response to the need to slow climate change. Innovative entrepreneurship opportunities and employment positions related to carbon neutrality continue to sprout up. For example, as ""carbon"" becomes a strategic asset, enterprises have a substantial demand for professionals in carbon accounting and management, resulting in a surge of new job positions. Relevant technologies and market applications also attract a multitude of innovators and entrepreneurs.

(2) The industrial revolution is evident during the process of mitigating climate change, as emerging industries rapidly develop and gradually replace existing ones. For instance, the swift development of the new energy industry and its supporting sectors in recent years has driven the development of the energy storage industry. Additionally, new energy vehicles are gradually replacing traditional fuel ones, leading to changes in the competition landscape and core technologies of the automotive industry. The application of digital and intelligent technology aids the manufacturing industry in achieving the goal of green transition and carbon neutrality, contributing to the high-end transformation of industries and enterprises.

(3) Emerging strategic resources become crucial for enterprises to attract investment and financing. Green initiatives have become a resource for enterprises to attract investment and financing. ESG(environment, social and governance) ratings have become a crucial indicator of whether companies can obtain financing and loans. Carbon trading will also bring companies new revenue sources. Resources like sunlight, water, and wind have evolved into crucial resource endowments for enterprises and countries. Countries and regions abundant in these new and crucial strategic resources will witness shifts in their domestic and international influences.

(4) Demonstration of international competitiveness and industry leadership is linked to the capacity for green innovation and the ability to achieve carbon neutrality. These factors influence the proactiveness and competitiveness of various organizations and countries in global business activities and international business affairs, as well as their international image and market reputation. These capabilities have become essential tools and means to address regional crises. Companies like CATL and BYD have become industry leaders in the global new energy market. Chinese enterprises have contributed to the sustainable environmental and social development of regions including Asia, Africa, and Latin America, facilitating their development and growth in these regions. Meanwhile, the implementation of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), for example, demonstrates that the ability to reduce carbon emissions will affect enterprises’ import and export costs and international competitiveness.

(5) Improved quality of life for people is a result of environmental protection and improvement, which reduces the adverse impact of harsh environments on health. This, in turn, lowers the demand for medical resources and elevates the overall quality of life, indirectly accelerating socio-economic development.

On the other hand, socio-economic development further promotes innovative entrepreneurial activities that mitigate climate change. Market-driven technological applications propel the iterative upgrading of green technologies, thus driving overall technological innovation. When people benefit from improved ecological environments, they become more receptive to related technologies and innovations, thereby propelling the development of related technological innovations and entrepreneurial activities. Moreover, when companies benefit from improvements in the ecological environment, they enhance their competitiveness and innovative capacity, boosting their ability to innovate related technologies and undertake entrepreneurial activities.

Therefore, the improvement of the ecological environment through mitigating climate change and the green and sustainable development of businesses are mutually influential and complementary, often leading to their coordinated development.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

outheast Asian defence ministers meet in Indonesia alongside key players in the Indo-Pacific this week, with the ASEAN bloc set to reinforce a message of centrality as major powers jostle for influence in the region.

The annual get-together, which starts on Wednesday, comes as conflict rages in the Middle East and Ukraine and as tensions ratchet up in disputed waters in the South China Sea, where China is being accused of aggression against the Philippines, which has US backing and seeks to boost its military ties with Japan.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) chair Indonesia has yet to confirm attendees, but among them is US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who will meet ASEAN counterparts on Wednesday.

The talks will expand on Thursday to include Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, India, New Zealand and Australia.

ASEAN, a region of about 660 million people with a combined gross domestic product of more than $3.2 trillion, has for years been courted by Washington and Beijing, but their fierce rivalry has caused its members concern.

""Competition is good. But competition should not deteriorate into a zero-sum game,"" Defence Minister and presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto told a foreign policy forum this week, where he stressed the importance of non-alignment.

Relations between China and the United States have been frosty after President Joe Biden ordered the shooting down in February of a suspected Chinese spy balloon.

It was unclear who will represent China at the Jakarta meeting after the removal of its defence minister in October, raising questions about the stability of the leadership around President Xi Jinping.

Austin comes to Indonesia from South Korea, where he reiterated concerns about Russia and China helping North Korea to evade sanctions and Moscow's closer military ties with Pyongyang.

Washington has accused North Korea of supplying military equipment to Russia for use in its war with Ukraine, and Moscow of providing technical military support to help the North.

Aaron Connelly, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, said conflict in Gaza and Ukraine and China's moves to block Philippine resupply missions at a disputed reef will most likely feature at the meeting.

""This forum is not one where major geopolitical developments are really addressed or moved forward in any significant way. But we do expect discussions from the US and Philippines on topics like the Second Thomas Shoal, Israel-Hamas, Ukraine,"" Connelly said.

 A 'Watershed Event': Five Takeaways From Israel's Assassination Of Hamas' Political Leader In Tehran

Authored by Andrew Korybko via substack,

Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated by Israel early Wednesday morning in the heart of the Iranian capital hours after attending President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration. The details remain unclear, but it’s widely thought that he was killed by a precision drone strike at his residence. The world is watching to see whether Iran and/or its Resistance Axis allies will respond, what form it could take if so, and whether that would escalate tensions to a wider war.

Here are five takeaways thus far:

1. Israel’s Intelligence & Tactics Are Top-Notch

Israel somehow or another obtained accurate intelligence about Haniyeh’s location despite it being top-secret and was then able to successfully assassinate him. Whatever air defenses (including electronic warfare ones) that Iran had deployed in its capital as part of the security measures to protect its high-profile guests failed to thwart this attack. This is a major embarrassment for the Islamic Republic and prompts speculation about whether it was due to utter incompetence or was partially an inside job.

2. Iran Is Caught In A Dilemma Over How To Respond

It’s unimaginable that Iran won’t respond to its Israeli enemy assassinating a high-profile allied guest in Tehran during the new president’s inauguration, but the dilemma is over the form that this response will take. Launching another drone and missile salvo against Israel like it did in the spring after the bombing of its consulate in Damascus is possible, though Israel could spin that as a failure if many of them are shot down like last time, the on-the-ground damage is minimal, and no high-profile targets are killed.

3. Mutually Assured Destruction Hangs Heavy Over Everyone’s Head

The response that Iran resorts to will be determined by its leadership’s understanding of how far they can go without triggering the “mutually assured destruction” (MAD) scenario, which both Israel and the Resistance Axis fear and is why they’ve thus far restrained themselves from waging all-out war. A repeat of spring’s salvo could remain below that threshold, but Iran might also respond in a different way that’s interpreted by Israel as an escalation, thus prompting its own escalation that could then lead to MAD.

4. A Choreographed Response Might Therefore Be The Most “Rational”…

Duma member Dmitry Belik, whose claim to fame was helping Sevastopol reunify with Russia when he briefly served as the region’s acting head in spring 2014, described spring’s salvo as a “beautiful theatrical production”. If there’s any truth to his innuendo that Iran choreographed its response with the US and/or Israel to Israel’s bombing of its consulate in Syria, then it might also do the same after Haniyeh’s assassination, which could help Iran “save face” while averting an escalation towards MAD.

5. …But There’s No Guarantee That Iran’s Allies Will “Stand Down”

Hamas and Hezbollah are Iran’s allies but operate independently of it despite their close ties. There’s accordingly no guarantee that they’ll “stand down” and not respond in their own way if Iran sends another salvo to Israel regardless of whether or not it’s choreographed. After all, Hamas’ political chief was just killed, while one of Hezbollah’s top commanders was assassinated by Israel in Beirut the day prior. This makes the MAD risk even less manageable since those two might not share Iran’s calculations.

Haniyeh’s assassination is a watershed event in the latest Israeli-Hamas War, which is now a regional Israeli-Iranian proxy war, since it greatly spikes the risk of everything spiraling into MAD.

Iran’s response will be crucial in determining whether or not that happens, but so too will Hamas and Hezbollah’s.

They’ll either “stand down” as Iran responds regardless of whether or not it’s choreographed, participate in a joint response that remains below the MAD threshold, or decide to cross that red line on their own.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 As the world is becoming more and more aware about the dangers of climate change, various countries are trying to embrace the green energy. China is among those nations that are serious about using renewable sources of energy. Norwegian diplomat and former politician, Erik Solheim recently informed via his Twitter handle that the photovoltaic (PV) power plants of China increased their production capacity to 392.61 GW in 2022. Solheim added that the China’s export of PV products grew by 80 per cent to $51.3 billion, and nearly 46 per cent of it went to Europe. He also shared a video clip where hundreds of solar panels can be seen in a solar park.

Export of PV products increased by 80% to US$51.3 billion, about 46% went to Europe, a year-on-year increase of 115%

@DongshengNews @China4Tech

Wang Bohua, honorary chairman of the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, said that China’s export of solar product exceeded $50 billion for the first time last year, as mentioned in a report by Yicai Global. The export comprised panels worth $42.4 billion, silicon wafers of value $5.1 billion, and batteries amounting to $3.8 billion.

Among the main PV products, the polysilicon production of China jumped 63 per cent to 827,000 tons last year, according to Wang. Wang added that the cell production increased 61 per cent to 318 GW, while panel and wafer production increased by 59 per cent and 58 per cent to 288.7 GW and 357 GW, respectively.

In a recent development, US imports of solar panels have begun to pick up after months of gridlock stemming from the implementation of a new law that bans goods produced with forced labour, as told by two Chinese solar companies to Reuters. A White House official attributed the thaw in shipments to clearer rules for complying with the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act (UFLPA).

The gains come as a relief to major Chinese suppliers like Trina Solar and Jinko Solar. These suppliers are now finally getting products into the lucrative market of United States after long delays. Under the labour protection law, imports of products made in China’s Xinjiang region are prohibited. Chinese authorities have reportedly established labour camps for ethnic Uyghur and other Muslim groups in the Xinjiang region.

99,EN_UA_014829.txt,"Why the Media Don’t Want to Know the Truth About the Nord Stream Blasts 

 by Jonathan Cook, The Unz Review:

No one but the terminally naïve should be surprised that security services lie – and that they are all but certain to cover their tracks when they carry out operations that either violate domestic or international law or that would be near-universally rejected by their own populations.

Which is reason enough why anyone following the fallout from explosions last September that ripped holes in three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea supplying Russian gas to Europe should be wary of accepting anything Western agencies have to say on the matter.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

In fact, the only thing that Western publics should trust is the consensus among “investigators” that the three simultaneous blasts deep underwater on the pipelines – a fourth charge apparently failed to detonate – were sabotage, not some freak coincidental accident.

Someone blew up the Nord Stream pipelines, creating an untold environmental catastrophe as the pipes leaked huge quantities of methane, a supremely active global-warming gas. It was an act of unrivaled industrial and environmental terrorism.

If Washington had been able to pin the explosions on Russia, as it initially hoped, it would have done so with full vigor. There is nothing Western states would like more than to intensify world fury against Moscow, especially in the context of NATO’s express efforts to “weaken” Russia through a proxy war waged in Ukraine.

But, after the claim made the rounds of front pages for a week or two, the story of Russia destroying its own pipelines was quietly shelved. That was partly because it seemed too difficult to maintain a narrative in which Moscow chose to destroy a critical part of its own energy infrastructure.

Not only did the explosions cause Russia great financial harm – the country’s gas and oil revenues regularly financed nearly half of its annual budget – but the blasts removed Moscow’s chief influence over Germany, which had been until then heavily dependent on Russian gas. The initial media story required the Western public to believe that President Vladimir Putin willingly shot himself in the foot, losing his only leverage over European resolve to impose economic sanctions on his country.

But even more than the complete lack of a Russian motive, Western states knew they would be unable to build a plausible forensic case against Moscow for the Nord Stream blasts.

Instead, with no chance to milk the explosions for propaganda value, official Western interest in explaining what had happened to the Nord Stream pipelines wilted, despite the enormity of the event. That was reflected for months in an almost complete absence of media coverage.

When the matter was raised, it was to argue that separate investigations by Sweden, Germany and Denmark were all drawing a blank. Sweden even refused to share any of its findings with Germany and Denmark, arguing that to do so would harm its “national security.”

No one, again including the Western media, raised an eyebrow or showed a flicker of interest in what might be really going on behind the scenes. Western states and their compliant corporate media seemed quite ready to settle for the conclusion that this was a mystery cocooned in an enigma.

Isolated and friendless

It might have stayed that way forever, except that in February, a journalist – one of the most acclaimed investigative reporters of the past half-century – produced an account that finally demystified the explosions. Drawing on at least one anonymous, highly placed informant, Seymour Hersh pointed the finger for the explosions directly at the US administration and President Joe Biden himself.",1,"['URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
100,EN_UA_103372.txt,"Putin Says US, NATO Ignored Its Security Demands as Kremlin Rules out War in Ukraine 

 The president of Russia said on Friday the United States and its NATO allies have ignored Moscow’s security demands, while a top Kremlin official said Russia does not want a war.

“There won’t be a war as far as it depends on the Russian Federation, we don’t want a war,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during an interview with local radio stations. “But we won’t let our interests be rudely trampled on and ignored.”

During the call, Putin said he wants to continue dialogue with the West to negotiate a stalled peace agreement for eastern Ukraine between Russia, Ukraine, France, and Germany. Presidential envoys from the four countries already met in Paris on Wednesday and agreed to another meeting in Berlin in two weeks.

The latest diplomatic move also comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday called on the West not to create “panic,” challenging U.S. warnings about an imminent Russian attack.

“I don’t consider the situation now tenser than before. There is a feeling abroad that there is war here. That’s not the case,” Zelensky told reporters at a Friday press briefing. “We don’t need this panic,” he added.

Zelensky’s comment comes one day after rumors spread that President Joe Biden warned him during a phone call that Kyiv would soon be “sacked” in an invasion by Russian military forces.

“He has previously said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months. Reports of anything more or different than that are completely false,” she said.

Meanwhile, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko also ruled out that there will be war, saying there will not be a war unless Belarus or Russia comes under attack.

“The leaders of some countries have gone mad, they think they can win that war,” Lukashenko said. “But there will be no victory, we will all lose.”

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told parliament the number of Russian troops near Ukraine—which amounts to about 130,000—is comparable to Moscow’s military buildup last spring, when Moscow eventually pulled its forces back after massive exercises.

“We haven’t observed any events or actions of military character that significantly differ from what was going on last spring,” with the exception of the deployment to Belarus, Reznikov said.

While Moscow and the West are mulling their next steps, NATO said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region, and the United States ordered 8,500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe.

Russia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, and dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic. Russian troops have also headed to Belarus for sweeping joint drills, again raising Western fears that Moscow could stage an attack on Ukraine from the north.",1,['URW: Amplifying war-related fears'],['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships Ms. Chrysoula Zacharopoulou and ECW Executive Director Yasmine Sherif call on donors and the private sector to urgently provide a total of US$1.5 billion.

NEW YORK, Sept. 23, 2023 At this weekend’s Global Citizen Festival in New York, France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships, Ms. Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, and Education Cannot Wait Executive Director Yasmine Sherif announced €40 million in new, additional funding from the Government of France.

Education Cannot Wait (ECW) has now mobilized US$870 million toward its 2023-2026 Strategic Plan to reach 20 million crisis-impacted children with the safety, hope and opportunity of a quality education.

“Championing global education and emancipation is an absolute priority for France. The message of the Paris Pact for People and the Planet is that we must all take our part to allow each country to alleviate poverty and tackle climate change,” said France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou. “This includes states, which must support development policies with sufficient resources. For this reason, I am particularly pleased to announce, on behalf of France and President Macron, the allocation of €40 million to support ECW’s actions for the 2023-2026 cycle.”

“With this new bold and generous contribution, France shines as an example for others to follow,” said ECW Executive Director Yasmine Sherif. “We call on government donors, philanthropic foundations, and the private sector to follow suit and join our collective efforts to mobilize a total of US$1.5 billion by 2026 to provide quality education to 20 million crisis-affected girls and boys so they can learn, grow and rebuild their societies.”

Globally, around 224 million children are deprived of a quality education due to armed conflicts, forced displacement, climate-induced disasters and other protracted crises. They need urgent support to fulfil their right to a quality, inclusive education.

Together with strategic partners, ECW has already reached close to 9 million girls and boys in some of the harshest crises around the globe.

While donors are stepping up, the funding gap has actually widened in recent years. Humanitarian appeals for education in emergencies have nearly tripled from US$1.1 billion in 2019 to almost US$3 billion at the end of 2022.

Brussels has found yet another way to take hundreds of thousands of euros out of European taxpayers' pockets, and it's evident which member state is controlling the EU bubble.

Another session of the European Parliament is behind us and we are one step closer to a European Green Deal. This is what Joachim Brudzinski, MEP for Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party, said following this week’s EP debate on the energy performance of EU buildings.

In his view, this is just the latest directive that will result in hundreds of thousands of euros being siphoned off by Brussels from the pockets of Polish and European citizens. The directive includes a ban on gas boilers by 2025. „If this is not an example of a particular kind of ecological madness, or even idiocy, then there are other examples of Brussels’s mad ambitions,” the PiS politician said. The directive would also stipulate that all new buildings must be zero emission by 2030. He believes this is ideological madness, best exemplified by the fact that until the war in Ukraine, gas was the so-called „clean energy source” powering Europe’s largest economy. Brudzinski also pointed out that it is clear who controls Brussels and whose will and interests prevail in EU actions.

„As long as Germany had Nord Stream with Russia, gas was fine. When Nord Stream was stopped, suddenly the Germans realised that gas was fossil energy and they were already saying we should move away from gas. And what should we switch to? Heat pumps. Where will these pumps be manufactured? Well, new factories are already mushrooming along the German-Polish border – in Germany, in fact.”

the Polish MEP pointed out.

The vice president of the Law and Justice Party explained that no European funding had been provided to implement the directive.

 Stakeholders at a programme on Sunday said that collaborative strategies and innovation were keys to unlocking Bangladesh’s circular apparel industry for availing a significant opportunity for the country to reduce its environmental impact, improve its economic performance and create social benefits.

The readymade garment sector in Bangladesh is under a transformative journey towards circularity, but embracing circularity also poses certain challenges that must be collectively considered and resolved, they said.

A panel of industry leaders, policymakers and experts in circular economies made the comments at an event titled ‘Switch to Upstream Circularity Dialogue: Pre-consumer Textile Waste in Bangladesh’ at the Amari Hotel in Dhaka on Sunday.

The event was organised under the Switch to Circular Economy Value Chains project (SWITCH2CE), co-funded by the European Union and the government of Finland.

Parliamentary standing committee on the ministry of environment, forest and climate change chairman Saber Hossain Chowdhury was present in the opening session as chief guest.

Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Faruque Hassan spoke at the opening session as special guest.

Deputy head of European Union to Bangladesh delegation mission Bernd Spanier, SWITCH2CE chief technical adviser Mark Draeck, among others, also contributed to the event’s opening session.

Hilde van Duijn, head of Global Value Chains, Circle Economy, also participated in the event and made circular game demonstration.

Faruque Hassan said, ‘Living in a world in our time where climate is most threatened, business as usual is no more an option. In a race to zero emission and resource decoupling, circularity emerges as the “next normal” linking business and sustainable development. For the BGMEA, circularity sits in the core of our values, mission and vision. Our goal is to help conserve the natural eco-system as much as possible via an economic shift from a linear to circular system, while generating greater social and economic values.’

Mark Draeck said, ‘With the support of the European Union and the government of Finland, UNIDO leads the global Switch to Circular Economy Value Chains project.’

‘In Bangladesh, we support the circular transition for the textile and garments industry, by piloting innovative circular solutions in close cooperation with global and national industry leaders, which as BESTSELLER, H&M and their manufacturers,’ he said.

‘These pilots will address acute challenges on new technology, business models and traceability, and will demonstrate the economic opportunity for circular approaches.

104,EN_CC_100009.txt,"Interview: Chinese wisdom aids sustainable development of new World Heritage Site 

 BEIJING, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cultural Landscape of Old Tea Forests of the Jingmai Mountain in Pu'er, southwest China, embodies the wisdom of China's agrarian culture and is an example of positive interaction between people and nature, and of their sustainable development, a Chinese official has said.

Li Qun, deputy minister of culture and tourism and head of the National Cultural Heritage Administration, made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua. The site was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List on Sunday during the extended 45th session of the World Heritage Committee ongoing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

With the addition of this new listing, China's number of UNESCO World Heritage sites has risen to 57. The Cultural Landscape of Old Tea Forests of the Jingmai Mountain in Pu'er is the very first tea-themed world cultural heritage site globally.

On what makes this site stand out and on what sort of cultural insights it offers, Li said the cultural landscape comprises five ancient tea forests, nine traditional villages and three protective forests, which maintain their vitality to this day.

""According to archaeological findings, the cultivation of tea trees in ancient China can be traced back over 6,000 years,"" Li said. ""Subsequently, tea culture and the practice of growing and consuming tea spread from China to neighboring countries and beyond.""

The cultural landscape has resulted in a unique protection system combining government management with grassroots governance, which ensures the protection of cultural and biological diversity and the sustainable use of natural resources, Li said.

This heritage, he said, also demonstrates the unique tradition of the complementary use of natural resources in mountainous environments by many of China's ethnic groups.

Its success in achieving World Heritage Site status is ""a significant achievement in presenting an authentic picture of ancient and modern China to the world,"" the official said.

China plans to implement preservation and management initiatives in five key areas, Li said.

Emphasizing the importance of prioritizing protection and planning ahead, Li highlighted the need for the coordinated planning of protection and management measures for ancient tea forests, villages and traditional residential architecture. Such an approach aims to strike a balance between heritage preservation and development.

Furthermore, China intends to invest in research on core technologies to enhance its monitoring capabilities for ancient tea forests as well as rare flora and rare fauna, and its capabilities for climate change responses.

To promote the sustainable development of its heritage sites, China aims to improve the participation mechanism for locals and other stakeholders. The involvement of local communities, particularly people from younger generations, will be encouraged and guided to contribute to the dissemination of tea culture and the growth of the tea industry.

China will continue to delve into the history of the tea industry, explore the philosophical depth of tea culture, and elucidate the global influence of Chinese tea culture. The country seeks to tap into the value of this heritage and promote its traditional culture further.

The official said that efforts are underway to promote the effective utilization and regulated development of cultural World Heritage Sites, aiming to breathe new life into these invaluable treasures. ■",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A group of UK-based climate activists, called the Tyre Extinguishers, is moving around deflating the tyres of parked SUVs (sports utility vehicles) on roads in an effort to combat global warming.

The group has claimed credit for tyre-deflating operations in American cities including New York City, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, and cities in England, Canada, France, Spain, Germany and Italy among others, according to a report by Fox News.

“Reports coming in of very angry #CarShaggers who are upset they can’t drive their massive tanks around Lisbon. Oh no! Welcome to the fun, Portugal! We will make SUVs history,” the group posted on Twitter along with an image of a Portuguese-language pamphlet the activists left on one of the targeted SUVs.

On their own website, the “Tyre Extinguishers” who believe in guerilla climate activism explain why they are protesting against SUVs. The group’s website has details and instructions on how to quickly deflate tires on parked cars. It also has a template for pamphlets that activists can use during their operations. Once the person deflates the tyres, they leave a document with a headline stating, “ATTENTION - your gas guzzler kills,” on the vehicle’s windshield explaining to its owner why such action was taken.

“You’ll be angry, but don’t take it personally. It’s not you, it’s your car. We did this because driving around in urban areas in your massive vehicle has huge consequences for others,” the pamphlet reads.

Centrica’s grants of £250 to £750 for customers least able to pay their monstrous new gas bills are welcome.

But they still won’t make much of a dent.

No surprise there when the firm is donating only ten per cent of the profits from its British Gas arm.

That’s a negligible fraction of Centrica’s soaring total: £1.34billion in just six months this year.

107,EN_UA_021918.txt,"US, China, Israel and others are developing AI killer drones; this poses significant risks 

 by Rhoda Wilson, Expose News:

The Pentagon’s recent developments in AI technology have drawn concern and criticism as they approach the deployment of autonomous AI weapons systems capable of making lethal decisions independently.

The New York Times reports that countries such as the United States, China and Israel are actively working on lethal autonomous weapons empowered by artificial intelligence (“AI”), which can autonomously identify and engage targets.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Critics argue that the use of AI-controlled drones with the ability to autonomously kill humans is a highly alarming development, as it places life-or-death choices on machines with minimal human oversight. Several countries, including Russia, Australia and Israel are opposing efforts by other nations to pass a binding resolution at the United Nations calling for a ban on AI killer drones.

The issue surrounding the deployment of AI weapons has sparked intense debate, with key questions revolving around the role of human agency in the use of force. Austria’s chief negotiator on the matter, Alexander Kmentt, emphasised that this issue is not just a security and legal concern but also an ethical one.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon has revealed plans to deploy swarms of AI-enabled drones as part of their AI weapons programme. These drones, equipped with advanced AI capabilities, are intended to provide the United States with a tactical advantage, countering the numerical superiority of China’s Liberation Army.

US Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks further highlighted the role of AI-controlled drone swarms in reshaping battlefield dynamics, making them harder to plan against, hit and defeat. However, concerns arise regarding human supervision and decision-making capabilities, as some argue that limitations on AI’s autonomy could hinder strategic advantages.

Critics also point to recent incidents where AI drones have been utilised in conflict zones, such as Ukraine’s use of AI-controlled drones during its conflict with Russia. The extent of human casualties caused by these AI drones remains uncertain, raising additional concerns.

 How Putin has amassed a staggering SIX THOUSAND nuclear weapons that could reach UK in 20 minutes

AS sabre rattling goes, it takes some beating.

Vladimir Putin’s thinly-veiled threat to nuke the West and insistence that he is ""not bluffing"" has caused panic across the world.

Since the Cold War started, it has been assumed the threat of “mutually assured destruction” — in which tit-for-tat strikes would destroy both parties — would prevent a nuclear war.

However, in a chilling threat this week, the unhinged Russian leader declared: ""When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will use all the means at our disposal to defend Russia and our people, this is not a bluff.""

With the dictator’s invasion of Ukraine meeting far stiffer resistance than expected and Western governments uniting against it, such desperate — and terrifying — measures appear more likely.

When Putin announced his invasion, he warned the West that it would face “consequences never encountered in your history” if Nato was to interfere militarily.

So, could the nightmare come true? Putin certainly has the hardware for every scenario.

At his disposal are an estimated 5,977 warheads, of which 1,600 are ready to be deployed. This terrifying arsenal can be launched from land, submarines and planes.

They include non-strategic “battlefield” nukes which have a smaller destructive power — and radioactive fallout — and are intended to destroy military capabilities rather than civilian populations. They can be anything from land mines to torpedos.

They have never been used in combat — so far.

Russia also has the more feared strategic nuclear weapons, which can be launched as warheads on powerful long-range missiles.

They include intercontinental ballistic missiles which would take just 20 minutes to get to Britain — and 30 to the US. These strategic weapons, with deliberately terrifying names such as Satan, are designed to wipe out entire cities.

Unleashing such weapons would come with a huge amount of risk for Putin. He knows Nato forces have an equally deadly stockpile, with the US retaining 5,428 warheads alongside the UK’s 225 and France’s 290.

But he may not care about retaliation.

The Russian leader suggested in 2018 he would be willing to see his homeland destroyed in a nuclear conflict.

He said: “If someone decides to annihilate Russia, we have the legal right to respond. Yes, it will be a catastrophe for humanity and for the world. But I’m a citizen of Russia and its head of state.

“Why do we need a world without Russia in it?”

This, though, was clearly a threat to respond in kind if Russia is ever attacked first.

Sam Ashworth-Hayes, of the Henry Jackson Society, told The Sun previously: “I think there is only a risk of escalation if Nato forces did directly become involved in the war in Ukraine.

“The message from Vladimir Putin to the West is to stay out of our business, because we will escalate if you interfere.”

Nato has made it clear it has no intention of intervening militarily in Ukraine. But one Russian analyst speculated Putin might fire a nuclear warning shot our way.

Pavel Felgenhauer, of the independently minded Novaya Gazeta, said: “One option for him is to cut gas supplies to Europe, hoping that will make the Europeans climb down. Another option is to explode a nuclear weapon somewhere over the North Sea between Britain and Denmark — and see what happens.”

And US intelligence spies fear Russia might have an “escalate to de-escalate” policy, which means if they should find themselves in conflict with Nato, they would threaten to use low-yield nukes in order to bring a war to an end.

'CONCERNING'

Many wonder whether the former KGB spymaster has become unhinged enough to risk escalating a conflict in this way.

But one expert believes this could be a ploy. Professor Andrew Wilson, from UCL, said: “Putin is playing a bit on the crazy. The theory goes that if people think I am mad enough to use them then that plays to my advantage.”

However, Mr Ashworth-Hayes thinks use of nukes is unlikely. He said: “It is important for people to stay calm. Tensions are very high, but there is no chance of either side launching nuclear weapons.

BORIS Johnson today demanded Vladimir Putin ""steps back from the brink"" of war to avoid a brutal bloodbath in Ukraine.

At showdown talks TONIGHT the PM will warn the sabre-rattling Kremlin strongman he'll be ""bitterly and bloodily resisted"" if he invades.

Russia has marshalled more than 100,000 troops on the border of Ukraine and is poised to march in.

Mr Johnson - who is flying to Ukraine tomorrow said an invasion would be ""an absolute disaster for the world"".

Speaking in Essex, Mr Johnson said: ""What I will say to President Putin, as I have said before, is that I think we really all need to step back from the brink.

""I think Russia needs to step back from the brink.

""I think that an invasion of Ukraine, any incursion into Ukraine beyond the territory that Russia has already taken in 2014 would be an absolute disaster for the world, and above all it would be a disaster for Russia.""

 This aerial photo taken on May 4, 2023 shows a photovoltaic power station of Almaty in Kazakhstan. (Photo by Kalizhan Ospanov/Xinhua)

The BRI has contributed very important green rail corridors in Kenya, Ethiopia, Laos and most recently in Indonesia. Overseas BRI projects have been paying much emphasize on local environmental protection, fostering harmonious development of human and nature.

BEIJING, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- ""On the ten years anniversary we can declare the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) an amazingly successful initiative"", said Erik Solheim, chairman of the Europe-Asia Center, former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Commending the pioneering role of the initiative in promoting employment and alleviating poverty, Solheim said, ""Nearly 150 countries take part in the BRI and benefit from the investments, trade, technology transfer and people to people contact with China.""

Solheim, former Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, highly appreciated the accomplishments of the initiative in advancing sustainable development.

""China has defeated air and water pollution much faster than any other nation,"" he said, referring to China's Zhejiang province as a world leader in river conservation, and the cities of Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shenzhen as among the world's greenest cities. ""This gives China enormous strength in sharing experiences with other nations.""

The BRI, he said, has contributed very important green rail corridors in Kenya, Ethiopia, Laos and most recently in Indonesia. Overseas BRI projects have been paying much emphasize on local environmental protection, fostering harmonious development of human and nature.

Solheim also spoke positively of China's decision to stop building coal plants overseas, which ""coincide with similar developments in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Kenya and many other nations along the BRI.""

""The BRI is progressively greener, with a massive focus on solar, wind, hydro and green transport. In the future, it will be the world's number one vehicle for green investments,"" he said.

Solheim emphasized the need for increased cooperation between Europe and China, which is ""critical for environment protection, global economic development and world peace.""

He criticized the ""de-risking"" narrative as ""decoupling"" in essence, which is ""a stupid and dangerous way of scoring own goals."" Both de-risking and decoupling will lead to impoverishment and escalate the likelihood of conflict, he said.

""We need to find the right balance between competition and cooperation. This demands a strong and open dialogue between Europe and China,"" said the environmental protection expert.

 BAKU, Azerbaijan, April 23. COP29 is an opportunity for Azerbaijan to announce itself to the world as a country taking part in solving global environmental problems, editor of London-based Energy Intelligence Michael Ritchie told Trend.

""During COP29 in November, all eyes will be on Azerbaijan. The event will be attended by tens of thousands of journalists, participants, and delegates. There will also be questions about why the oil and gas producer is taking part in the climate talks. But COP29 follows immediately after this conference in the United Arab Emirates, also a major oil and gas producer. The UK, where I come from, is also an oil and gas producer and has also hosted this conference. COP29 is an opportunity for Azerbaijan to announce itself to the world as a country that is taking part in solving global environmental problems,"" Ritchie said.

According to him, COP29 is crucial to achieve financial goals and to obtain additional funds, possibly from developed countries, for climate finance. It will also lay the groundwork for the next COP30 in Brazil.

To note, Azerbaijan will host the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29) in November this year. The decision was made at the plenary meeting of COP28 held in Dubai on December 11 last year. Within two weeks, Baku, having become the center of the world, will host about 70,000–80,000 foreign guests.

The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is an agreement signed at the Rio Earth Summit in June 1992 to prevent dangerous human interference in the climate system. The acronym COP (Conference of Parties) stands for Conference of Parties, which is the highest legislative body overseeing the implementation of the Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The parties to the convention are 198 countries. Unless the parties have decided otherwise, COP is held annually. The first COP event was held in March 1995 in Germany's Berlin, and its secretariat is located in Bonn.

 Warning US hospitals are ‘most vulnerable to cyber attack that will be more devastating than 9/11’ in wake of Covid

AMERICAN hospitals are most vulnerable to a cyberattack that would be more devastating than the September 11 terror attacks, an expert fears.

Professor Scheherazade Rehman, director of the European Union Research Center (EURC), warned that the healthcare sector has been ""exacerbated"" by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Rehman said financial institutions have upgraded their cyber defenses over the past decade - unlike healthcare.

She told The Sun: ""We don't have anything that the banks are doing in healthcare settings from hospitals to healthcare delivery centers.

""If your card has been hacked, the bank can lock it down and switch the number.

“But you cannot change your blood type, you can’t change if you’ve had cancer, you can’t change your date of birth or your DNA. Healthcare information once hacked is not reversible.

“Simply changing someone’s birthday is enough to disrupt the entire US online health system and fixing it would be very, very difficult.”

The expert said that a potential cyberattack on institutions would be “more crippling” than a terrorist attack.

She added: “9/11 was a shock event. It was traumatic as we had never seen anything like it before.

Most read in Tech

“But, the real disruption to people, companies, and systems of governance is going to be a cyberattack.”

In June 2017, the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force warned in a report that healthcare cybersecurity is in a “critical condition”.

The dossier stated: “Healthcare cybersecurity is a key public health concern that needs immediate and aggressive attention.”

Researchers at the computer hardware company IBM say that healthcare firms on average take around 236 days to detect a data breach, and 93 days to mitigate the damage.

This compares to the average of 207 days to identify and 73 days to contain a cyberattack.

'EASY TARGETS'

And, US hospitals have around 10-15 networked medical devices per bed on average, meaning officials are working to secure machinery that’s easy to breach, according to Wired.

Analysts at the Brookings Institute believe “the fate of healthcare security” depends on whether investments in cybersecurity are made.

They said: “Just as a responsible healthcare professional seeks to identify and treat patients’ underlying chronic conditions before they cause a serious medical emergency, so too must responsible healthcare organizations address vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure to prevent cyberattacks.""

Fears of a potential cyberattack on US institutions are rising amid the crisis in Ukraine.

Department of Homeland Security officials warned that the US is on “heightened alert” for a potential cyberattack from Moscow.

Rehman believes an attack on the US is ""highly likely"" should the crisis in Eastern Europe escalate.

Pentagon officials warned Friday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would result in a ""horrific"" aftermath.

Moscow has amassed around 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border - something which Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he hadn't seen in the past four decades.

Rehman said: “A US response would probably set off what we believe will be the world’s first large-scale cyberwar.

US IN 'WARFARE STATE'

“The Russians have been doing cyber-espionage and pre-positioning operations – meaning they’re setting up vulnerabilities in our infrastructure which means when they’re ready, they can release. It might not necessarily be tomorrow.”

R.P. Eddy, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Ergo, warned that the US is already in a “warfare state” with Moscow, Fox News reports.

He told governors: “What’s Russia’s next move? [It’s] very likely is to increase cyberattacks. It’s an easy move for them.

“We are already in a warfare state right now and we need to be aware of that.”

Jen Easterly, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), warned said officials are taking any ""rippling effects"" of a potential Russian invasion “very seriously”.

 THIS is the astonishing moment a Ukrainian armoured vehicle bravely takes on a vastly more powerful Russian tank in a ferocious firefight - and WINS.

The astounding video filmed from a drone appears to show a Ukrainian BTR-4 raining hell on the invaders' tank in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine.

The BTR-4 appears to unload a volley of rounds from its 30mm cannon causing severe damage to Putin's war machine - despite it having 40mm armour.

Rounds can be seen streaking through the air in the dramatic David and Goliath struggle.

And after pounding what is believed to be a Russian T-72 tank - a ferocious inferno engulfs and then obliterates it leaving the machine in tatters.

The humiliating scenes come despite Putin's battle tanks being fitted with 125mm cannons - more than FOUR TIMES the size of a BTR-4.

Its main gun can fire armour-piercing shells and highly explosive rounds.

It can also launch AT-11 laser guided anti-tank missiles.

But the 44.5 tonne tanks are less mobile and quick to aim than nippy troop carriers like the BTR-4, whose cannons can rapid-fire.

The T-72 and other variants of it has seen extensive use on both sides in the war in the Donbas since 2014 and the Russo-Ukrainian.

It is a family of Soviet/Russian main battle tanks that entered production in 1969.

Latest estimates suggest Putin's savages have now lost an eyewatering 756 battle tanks since the war began on February 24.

That comes alongside estimates that Russia has lost an astonishing 20,000 men in just 50-days of war.

They have also seen 163 planes and 144 helicopters blasted out the sky above war ravaged Ukraine.

Russia's latest military humiliation comes as the Kremlin redeploys forces eastward after a disaster campaign to take the capital Kyiv.

REDEPLOYMENT

Putin is now focusing efforts in the Donbas region which has been gripped by war between government forces and pro-Russian separatists since 2014.

Russia annexed Crimea the same year and recognize the independence of the rebel regions in the Donbas.

Moscow now intends to forge a strategic corridor between Crimea and its own sovereign territory via the Donbas.

It means roads such as the one shown in the video will remain scenes of intense fighting for months to come.

It comes as the Russian military continues to move helicopters and other equipment together for such an effort, according to a senior U.S. defence official.

And worryingly it is likely to insert more ground combat units in the region once it has regrouped after shouldering massive losses.

But it's unclear precisely when Russia will launch a bigger offensive in the Donbas.

It comes as Russia's flagship Moskva was sunk after an extraordinary missile attack by the Ukrainians.

HUMILIATION

The ship - a 40-year-old symbol of Russian military might - was left a smouldering wreck after taking direct hits from two Neptune anti-ship missiles.

The ship later sunk as it was being towed to naval port Sevastopol in Crimea.

First Rank Captain Anton Kuprin, 44, was killed after the ship was hammered by the missiles, according to Kyiv sources.

It has been alleged that only around 50 of the crew are accounted for - having been picked up by a Turkish vessel.

While another 14 were reportedly flown to the port of Sevastopol, leaving around 450 whose fates remain a mystery.

Video from within in Sevastopol overnight shows dozens of cars purportedly belonging to the sailors still parked in the port - suggesting their owners haven't come to collect them.

The sinking of the Soviet-era Moskva in the Black Sea prompted Russia to launch a furious retaliation, later claiming to have blitzed the factory which made the missiles that sunk their prized flagship.

The defence ministry said it had rocketed the 'Vizar' plant on the edge of Kyiv on Thursday night which it says manufactures Neptune anti-ship missiles.

Russian Vladimir Putin, craving bloody revenge for the sinking, then ordered a brutal new bombing campaign promising more strikes against the Ukrainian capital.

In a statement, Russia defence ministry said: ""The number and scale of missile strikes on targets in Kyiv will increase in response to any terrorist attacks or acts of sabotage on Russian territory committed by the Kyiv nationalist regime.""

Strikes later rocked the capital Kyiv on Thursday night, according to Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko.

Social media videos have shown the sky above Kyiv lit up by countless explosions - they appear to be the most serious attacks since Russia retreated from the capital earlier this month.

While blasts were also heard in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk.

 By 0724 GMT, the rouble was 1.4 percent weaker against the dollar at 100.84, passing the 100 threshold for the first time since March 23, 2022.

he rouble slumped to 100 against the dollar on Monday, hitting three figures for the first time in almost 17 months, struggling under the weight of strong foreign exchange demand and Russia's shrinking balance of trade.

By 0724 GMT, the rouble was 1.4 percent weaker against the dollar at 100.84, passing the 100 threshold for the first time since March 23, 2022.

It lost 1.5 percent to trade at 110.44 versus the euro, also a near 17-month low, and shed 1.3 percent against the yuan to 13.87.

The rouble has chartered a turbulent course since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, slumping to a record low of 120 against the dollar in March last year before recovering to a more than seven-year high a few months later, supported by capital controls and surging export revenues.

Russia's central bank has blamed the rouble's weakening on falling export revenues and recovering imports, but a Kremlin aide on Monday said loose monetary policy was to blame, a sign of discord among Russia's monetary authorities.

Brent crude oil LCOc1, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.9% at $86.05 a barrel, not far from a more than seven-month high hit last week.

The rouble, already under pressure amid robust demand for foreign currency and limited supply from exporting firms, has failed to benefit from strong oil prices.

A trader at a large Russian bank told Reuters the market was confused: ""Everyone is ready for the inflow of revenues from expensive oil, but it seems to be hanging somewhere, and our regulators are somehow indifferent, there is nothing to rely on.""

Getty Center, one of the top attractions in the U.S. West Coast city of Los Angeles, celebrated the annual Indigenous Peoples' Day over the weekend with an expansive family event aimed at highlighting both traditional and contemporary Indigenous perspectives.

The gathering on Saturday was part of Getty's continuous efforts to celebrate Southern California's vibrant Native American cultures. Sitting atop a hill in the Santa Monica Mountains, the Getty Center, a campus of the Getty Museum and other programs of the Getty Trust, took around 1.3 billion U.S. dollars to build and opened in December 1997. It is well known for its architecture, gardens, and bird's-eye views of Los Angeles.

Building on last year's success, where attendees learned about native plant dyes and relished musical performances, this year's event in the museum had a broader scope.

Generous support for this year's celebration came from the Getty Patron Program, which provides funds for exceptional exhibitions at the museum, reflecting the institution's commitment to diversity and inclusion.

""Los Angeles stands on indigenous land. Recognizing Indigenous Peoples' Day is not just about acknowledgment but about understanding, appreciating, and cherishing the cultures that have been here for thousands of years,"" former Los Angeles City Councilman Mitch O'Farrell remarked previously. O'Farrell was the first Native American to serve on the Los Angeles's City Council from 2013 to 2022.

Indigenous Peoples' Day is recognized on the second Monday of October, and its significance has grown over the years as an alternative to Columbus Day.

Rita, a teacher from Compton with Native American ancestry, attended the event with her family. ""It's essential for my children to see their culture celebrated so publicly. This is an educational experience, a cultural revival, and a family day out, all rolled into one.""

All-day activities included a tasting menu curated by culinary anthropologist Claudia Serrato, which offered attendees a chance to savor traditional Mesoamerican flavors like cacao, chia seeds, maíz, and amaranth. Participants also received recipe cards to recreate these delicacies at home.

Luna, inspired by the Alliance of Native American Chefs, attended the tasting event with an eye to learning more ways to develop her own brand of Native American cuisine that fuses her grandmother's cooking with modern flavors.

""I want to celebrate my amazing grandmother, of the Aqua Caliente tribe, who could do wonders with simple traditional ingredients, and encourage others to explore our unique culinary traditions,"" she told Xinhua.

The celebration further comprised a block stamp workshop led by Meztli Projects, where attendees learned about Mexica lifeways using linocut stamps.

""As someone deeply involved in the revival of indigenous arts, this event is a significant step forward,"" stated Carlos Red Feather, an artist from the Pacific Northwest. ""It's not just about the past; it's about the present and future of our art and our communities.""

""I've been attending these celebrations for years, and the shift in narrative is palpable,"" Linda M., a Native American LA resident, told Xinhua. ""We appreciate the efforts of California's leaders to ensure that our voices are heard, our histories acknowledged, and our rights secured.""

The event's broader intent was evident as it also shone light on the pressing challenges faced by Indigenous communities, such as discrimination, disproportionate impacts of climate change, and land rights.

Conversations echoed sentiments expressed by leaders like Alannah Hurley, executive director of United Tribes of Bristol Bay, who emphasized that the community is not merely a historical footnote but remains a crucial and vibrant part of the American fabric.

As the day ended, Mirim S., a student from the University of California, Los Angeles, reflected that ""today was more than a celebration. It was a call to action. We, the younger generation must ensure that the message of diversity and recognition is not confined to a single date but is carried on through our daily lives.""

As Los Angeles and other cities in California and across the United States continue to celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day, attendees expressed the hope that it would pave the way for greater understanding, recognition and collaboration in the future.

 by Prof Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research:

Eight years ago, on 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) was shot down in Eastern Ukraine.

In recent development, A Netherlands Court on November 17, 2022 found the Kremlin responsible for the alleged attack: two Russians and

a separatist Ukrainian” were identified as “guilty of mass murder for their involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17”.

The media has highlighted the downing of MH17 in the context of the war in Ukraine. The Court ruling is fraudulent, based on fabricated evidence.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

***

This background text was prepared in the context of the Kuala Lumpur MH17 Conference entitled MH17: The Quest for Justice, organized by JUST, the PGPF and the CRG in August 2019.

This comprehensive report provides detailed evidence that Russia was not involved in the downing of MH17.

It also confirms the insidious role of Ukraine’s intelligence agency.

****

The underlying objective is to examine the evidence, reveal the truth and uphold the rule of law.

Today, July 29th 2021, our thoughts are with the families of the victims of the Malaysian Airlines MH17 tragedy.

The 2019 Conference was dedicated to the memory of the victims.

It is also a national tragedy for the people of Malaysia. The downing of MH17 with 283 passengers and 15 crew on board, took place barely a few months following the mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 after departing on March 8, 2014 from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing, with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board.

It is worth recalling that immediately after the MH17 plane crash on July 17 2014, prior to the conduct of a preliminary investigation, Secretary of State John Kerry and US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power pointed their finger at Moscow without a shred of evidence. In turn, the allegations directed against Russia were used to justify the imposition of sweeping economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.

According to President Obama (hours after the tragedy):

“… the downing of MH17 should be “a wake-up call” to Europe to get serious about confronting Russia over Ukraine after EU leaders have proved reluctant to impose tought sanctions.” (Telegraph, July 18,2019)

The Wall Street Journal reports (July 18, 2014) that “Obama is getting his wish and Brussels is now weighing new sanctions”:

European governments, jolted by the downing of a passenger plane over eastern Ukraine that killed nearly 300 people, are contemplating a major expansion of sanctions on Russia as early as next week.

European Union leaders decided in recent days to expand the penalties to a broad new category of people and companies. But the apparent shooting down of a plane carrying more than 200 EU citizens has intensified a desire to act quickly and forcefully, including sanctions against oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin.

In Brussels, some diplomats described the incident as a game-changer. “It would have major consequences if it was certain it came from the rebels— major consequences,” said one official. (WSJ, July 18, 2014)

On July 22, 2014, The European Union decided to expand its sanctions blacklist against Moscow including Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.

EU foreign ministers decided to “draw up further broad measures including an arms embargo and financial restrictions on Russian businesses, … following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.” (Guardian, July 22, 2019)

 UK weather maps: Met Office issues yellow warnings over 70mph winds

The fierce winds are accompanied by a surprising change in temperature.

Met Office forecasts strong winds for the north

Crushing waves will slam the UK’s shores while power cuts and travel delays are likely as 70mph batter the country.

The Met Office has placed a yellow weather warning for wind as strong gales are predicted for much of the northeast of the UK. The weather warning covers Highlands & Eilean Siar and Orkney & Shetland in Scotland.

However, some experts predict heavy winds will also hit other coastlines along the UK. The “spell of very windy weather” is likely to lead to “travel disruption”, the weather agency said.

This includes impacting coastal routes and sea fronts with large waves, as well as possible loss of power and other services.

Delays to road, air and ferry transport are also “likely”.

While the worst of the winds will hit along the coast, speeds could still reach a substantial 60mph inland.

The weather warning is in place until 11am, although winds will remain throughout the day for much of the country.

The weather agency said: “Winds will increase quickly towards dawn Saturday across the Northern Isles with gusts generally reaching 50-60mph but with a smaller chance of 70mph gusts. Winds will quickly ease from late morning.”

The winds will accompany slightly warmer temperatures than in recent days. The mercury is likely to reach 13C in Belfast and 12C in Glasgow, both typically in the colder regions of the UK.

However the country is still reeling from the impact of Storm Isha and Storm Jocelyn.

With the ground saturated in various regions, the flood risk remains high.

Nine flood warnings were last night in place across England alone, including an alert for River Ouse in York city centre. The river burst its banks this week.

The closely consecutive storms has been attributed to the recent positions of jetstreams influencing low-pressure systems from the Atlantic. However, weather experts have also explained to Express.co.uk that climate change is likely having an impact on the number and severity of storms.

118,EN_CC_100005.txt,"Climate Crazies Fail in Attempt to Vandalize Another Classic Work of Art 

 Another of the world’s most recognized and most valuable pieces of art was the target of climate-change activists. Climate crazies tried — and failed — to glue themselves to Edvard Munch’s 1893 painting “The Scream” in Oslo on Friday.

It was yet another example of climate change activists using priceless works of art to protest the use of fossil fuels, which climate zealots believe is leading to global warming. In October, climate activists attacked “Girl with a Pearl Earring” by Johannes Vermeer in The Hague. Climate hysterics were also responsible for an attack on Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” and John Constable’s “The Hay Wain” in London over the summer.

The new climate-related vandalism fad seems to have begun with an attack on Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa” in which a climate fanatic feigned a disability in order to get close enough to smear a pastry on the painting.

In addition, “Peach Trees in Blossom” by Van Gogh; “My Heart’s in the Highlands” by Horatio McCulloch; “Tomson’s Aeolian Harp” by J.M.W. Turner; “The Last Supper” by Giampietrino; “Sistine Madonna” by Raphael; and “Haystacks” by Monet have been targeted by climate hysterics since May.

As of yet, none of the artwork has been damaged, due to being protected by glass.

Video of Friday’s attack shows two young climate vandals attempting to glue themselves to the artwork. Police apprehended the hooligans, and reported there was some glue residue on the glass that protects the paintings.

“I scream for people dying,” one of the activists shouted.

“I scream when lawmakers ignore science,” the other shouted.

The Norwegian climate activist group Stopp Oljeletinga, which translates to “Stop Oil Exploration,” claimed responsibility for the attack.

The group demands that the Norwegian government declare “an immediate halt to all further exploration for oil on the Norwegian continental shelf,” and present “a concrete plan for fair adjustment for today’s oil workers.”

A spokesperson for the group claimed that the vandalism was an attempt to “pressure lawmakers into stopping oil exploration.”

“We are campaigning against ‘Scream’ because it is perhaps Norway’s most famous painting,” said Astrid Rem, a spokesperson for Stopp Oljeletinga. “There have been lots of similar actions around Europe. They have managed something that no other action has managed: achieve an extremely large amount of coverage and press.”

But there’s good press and there’s bad press. These crazy antics are of the bad variety.

Norway is one of the world’s top oil exporters and provides oil and natural gas to much of Europe, a continent in the midst of a serious energy crunch brought about partly by the war in Ukraine. Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has severely restricted supplies and has shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which it claims was sabotaged.

Without much-needed Norwegian fossil fuels, Europe could be in for an extremely cold winter.

The art world has acknowledged their concern over the new phenomenon:

“In recent weeks, there have been several attacks on works of art in international museum collections. The activists responsible for them severely underestimate the fragility of these irreplaceable objects, which must be preserved as part of our world cultural heritage,” read a statement signed by approximately one hundred gallery directors and museums.

These climate crazies are apparently willing to allow a continent to freeze this winter over their fears of an over-hyped “problem” peddled by globalists who flew more than 400 carbon-spewing private jets to COP27 in Egypt last week. If they truly believe the hype surrounding climate change, they’re targeting the wrong thing.",1,"['CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement']","['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist']",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A Tesla Owner Just Exposed A Sick Secret About Electric Cars…

The left has been preaching global warming, cooling, climate change, and end-of-the-world nonsense since before many of us were born.

In his book An Inconvenient Truth: The Crisis of Global Warming, Al Gore attempted to persuade everyone that the globe was overheating.

Democrats are always negotiating deals that place the United States at a competitive disadvantage with other countries, some of whom are our foes, such as Communist China.

They manipulate children into doing their bidding by convincing them that they only have a few years to live.

For them, it’s a pretty decent racket. However, there is another viewpoint.

Economic observers have long known that there are no free lunches, and perhaps it’s time that electric-car fans did as well.

Leftists extol Teslas and other electric cars as cure-alls for fossil fuels’ woes – even when it comes to something as simple as their tires – but disregard the tremendous environmental damage these vehicles cause.

Brad Templeton, a Forbes contributor, related a story of his electric car tearing through pricey tires at breakneck speed.

Despite praising the many advantages of electric vehicles over traditional internal combustion engines, Templeton admitted that the requirement for tire replacement at short intervals is an inconvenient downside.

“The doozy was needing new tires at around 28,000 miles,” Temple writes in “Electric Vehicle Maintenance Is Super-Cheap, But The Dark Secret Is Tires” from last month.

“That was too early, far before their rated life.”

“One reason for this was a stupid mistake on my part. In the past, I’ve taken my gasoline cars in for regular service, and they were rotating my tires as needed during this service. Not taking my EV in for service, I never got the rotation done. That not only meant the drive tires of my car wore out faster, it also meant I could not make a warranty claim on them. Lesson learned.”

Electric vehicles do incur charges for what is classified as a repair rather than maintenance. Many Tesla 12v batteries have been reported to fail, albeit most are still under warranty. If you chip a windshield, bang a mirror, or get a car burglary, parts for premium cars are always pricey. He admits that neglecting to rotate the tires properly may have been his fault, but he contends that the added weight of his electric car, along with the necessity for high-efficiency, low-noise tires, meant an expensive purchase was always on the horizon. Apart from that, he characterizes the advantages of owning an electric vehicle as a world of guilt-free driving.

Like Pete Buttigieg, who urged average Americans to buy electric cars to avoid high gas costs while ignoring the $56,000 price tag, which has already proven to be a money trap.

Nonetheless, in light of this revelation, it appears that the tradeoff of electric vehicles – fewer environmental impacts for a higher price – is having the opposite effect.

Regular tread replacement will have an impact on the environment, both because of the fossil fuels required to manufacture them and because wear and tear contribute more harmful microplastics to the environment.

Given that modern tires contain petroleum-based plastics, a car tire requires between 7 and 22 gallons of oil to manufacture, according to a National Geographic article.

Somehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green”? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/iahDDqZRls

Microplastics become embedded in shrimp gills and guts, according to a study conducted by John Weinstein, a professor of physiology at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina.

“Somehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel, and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green?” Author Patrick De Haan wrote of the deadly bargain greenies have made with batteries made from land-scarred processes.

While proponents of electric vehicles argue that they are better for the environment, it is important to remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and environmental costs are rising faster than ever before.

120,EN_CC_100010.txt,"Leveraging Chinese expertise to help Pakistan expedite real estate growth 

 Pakistan’s collaboration with Chinese construction companies offers a unique opportunity to leverage their vast expertise to expedite its infrastructure and real estate development and adopt efficient construction techniques while ensuring high-quality standards and promoting sustainable practices.

Dr. Liaqat Ali Shah, Head of Policy CPEC in the Centre of Excellence for CPEC, said this while talking to WealthPK.

“The Chinese investment under the CPEC is mainly focused on infrastructure. The largest part went into setting up power generation plants, railway tracks, and building highway infrastructure. The CPEC's western alignment was also the focus of new infrastructure projects, which connected Pakistan's most underdeveloped regions with Gwadar and major urban centres.”

“Owing to China’s rapid urbanization in the last two decades, Chinese construction companies have had a lot of exposure to efficient construction techniques, which has given them a lot of expertise in these fields,” he said.

“Collaborating with Chinese construction firms allows Pakistan to benefit from these high-quality standards, contributing to the construction of a durable and resilient infrastructure. This is particularly crucial in regions prone to natural disasters, as the expertise garnered from the Chinese practices can help in designing and constructing buildings that can withstand various environmental challenges,” he opined.

“As the world collectively embraces the imperative of sustainable development, the Pak-China partnership aligns seamlessly with these global goals. Both nations recognize the importance of environment-friendly construction practices and adoption of green building materials.”

“Through joint research initiatives and knowledge-sharing, the collaboration will be instrumental in achieving the targets related to climate action and responsible consumption and production.”

“Implementing focused training programs and knowledge-sharing initiatives is crucial for cultivating a skilled and competitive construction workforce in Pakistan,” he suggested.

He further informed WealthPK that more than 5,000 trained and experienced Chinese engineers and workers and more than 2,000 Pakistani engineers and workers were involved in different projects under the CPEC.

According to the SBP Annual Report 2023, the construction industry recorded a contraction of 5.5 percent in FY23, after registering a moderate growth in the previous two years. Increase in input prices and wages, higher borrowing costs, and slower growth in development spending are the main factors which constrained the construction activity during FY23.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
121,EN_CC_100038.txt,"The Fed’s Climate Studies Are Full Of Hot Air 

 The Federal Reserve’s credibility is in tatters.

It predicted low inflation through 2021 even as the money supply exploded and higher inflation followed. To catch up, it quickly raised interest rates, stressing many banks, and Fed examiners failed to act before depositors noticed that Silicon Valley Bank was insolvent.

The result was bank runs and panic. But instead of lowering inflation and preventing recession, many of the Fed’s 400 economists are busy fighting climate change. [emphasis, links added]

Examples of climate activism abound.

This year the Fed is forcing big banks to produce complex reports on their climate vulnerability in a “pilot project” that is sure to expand and might lead to lending restrictions.

A query of the Fed’s listing of recent publications returns hundreds of research papers, press releases, and policy statements related to climate change. The San Francisco Fed hosted a conference on climate change in May, in which 27 Fed economists participated.

With all this effort, one might hope the Fed would produce high-quality research on climate change. But I took a close look at two Fed studies on the subject and found shockingly poor analysis.

These studies on the effect of temperature on U.S. and world economic growth are cited without a hint of skepticism and widely lavished with media attention. I’ve managed to debunk both.

In the September issue of Econ Journal Watch, I discredited a paper from the Richmond Fed claiming that warming reduces economic growth in the U.S.

I showed that the paper had serious problems with its statistical reasoning and robustness. My analysis concluded that the data used in the paper showed no meaningful relationship between temperatures and growth.

More recently I published a critique of a study from the Federal Reserve Board claiming that a year of above-normal temperatures in countries around the world makes economic contraction more likely.

The original study used sophisticated statistical techniques but failed to report that its primary finding was statistically insignificant. My request to the study’s author for computer code to reproduce the paper’s results went unanswered.

I managed to write the code from scratch and exactly replicate the results, allowing me to run additional tests that the author didn’t report.

The author’s primary result—that temperature has a bigger effect in bad than in good economic times—turned out to be statistically insignificant. Additional analysis showed that there is no reliable effect of temperature on growth at all.

There are two main reasons why the Fed study appeared at first to show a statistically significant effect of temperatures on economic growth. First, each country in the sample had equal weight in the analysis.

China had the same weight as St. Vincent though China’s population is 13,000 times as large. Equal weighting means that some small countries with unusual histories of economic growth greatly influenced the results.

The paper’s results disappeared when countries like Rwanda and Equatorial Guinea—which had economic catastrophes and bonanzas unrelated to climate change—were omitted.

Omitting similar countries representing less than 1% of the world’s gross domestic product was enough to eliminate the paper’s result. The complicated statistical techniques used in the Fed study magnified the influence of these unusual countries.

There’s a second reason why the Fed study appears to find that temperature affects growth: Many poor countries have warm climates.

A warm climate doesn’t preclude economic growth, as is demonstrated by Florida, Arizona, Taiwan, Singapore, and several Persian Gulf states. But the average poor country is warmer than the average rich country.

Debate continues as to whether this correlation is random or causal, but the hypothesis of the Fed paper is that year-to-year increases in temperature reduce annual economic growth.

The paper claims that its method controls for long-term differences in climate, but using simulated data I found that the Fed paper’s method can be fooled into finding an effect that doesn’t exist.

The only thing to learn from the Fed’s research is that climate propaganda is spreading fast, and when it comes to climate, academic economists are no more deserving of trust than are other supposed scientists and experts.

The Fed’s time would be better spent on more urgent matters, like improving its botched regulation of the banking system.

 The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Western sanctions on Moscow, have sent energy and food prices soaring in recent weeks, while rising natural gas prices also have impacted fertilizer production, which in turn hurts farmers.

ajor international organizations issued an appeal Wednesday for urgent measures to deal with rising food insecurity in poor countries, including financing to support farmers and increase food supplies.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Western sanctions on Moscow, have sent energy and food prices soaring in recent weeks, while rising natural gas prices also have impacted fertilizer production, which in turn hurts farmers.

""It is critical to quickly provide support for food insecure countries in a coordinated manner,"" the heads of the IMF, World Bank, World Trade Organization and UN World Food Program said in a joint statement.

Protests have erupted in some countries over high prices, and the statement said, ""The increase in food prices and supply shocks can fuel social tensions in many of the affected countries, especially those that are already fragile or affected by conflict.""

The organizations called on the international community to provide financing for emergency food supplies, a safety net for poor families and farmers, and to increase agricultural production.

They also called for ""open trade"" that avoids export restrictions or ""humanitarian food purchases.""

While the poor nations are most vulnerable to the crisis, middle income countries increasingly are at risk, the statement said.

""Surging fertilizer prices along with significant cuts in global supplies have important implications for food production in most countries, including major producers and exporters, who rely heavily on fertilizer imports,"" they said.

IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva, World Bank President David Malpass, WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and WFP director David Beasley issued the statement before next week's meeting of the IMF and World Bank.

Increased fragility

The war in Ukraine came as the global economy was trying to right itself following the COVID-19 pandemic, while navigating supply chain snarls that created shortages and a surge in inflation.

New lockdowns in China have added further uncertainty to the recovery.

Ukraine is a key source of grain while Russia is a major producer of energy and fertilizer needed for agriculture.

Protestors in Peru have taken to the streets to demand government action, as did people in Sri Lanka, where the government on Tuesday announced it was defaulting on its US$51 billion in foreign debt.

Poverty rose sharply during the pandemic, and the World Bank warns that for each one percentage point increase in food prices, 10 million people are thrown into extreme poverty worldwide.

""Sharply higher prices for staples and supply shortages are increasing pressure on households worldwide and pushing millions more into poverty,"" the officials said.

""Increased fragility and conflict pose persistent harm to people around the globe.""

124,EN_UA_000104.txt,"Senate blocks sanctions aimed at stopping Nord Stream 2 pipeline 

 The Senate blocked a measure to impose new sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany after the Biden administration warned it could disrupt allied unity in the confrontation over Ukraine.

The measure by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas failed on a vote of 55 to 44. It needed 60 votes to pass.

The vote was held open for several hours as Democrats grappled with a setback on unrelated voting rights legislation.

“Russia has nakedly and unequivocally used energy as energy blackmail,” Cruz said Thursday on the Senate floor. President Vladimir Putin has done that “openly, brazenly and laughingly and absolutely nothing happened,” Cruz said.

Opponents of the measure said it would damage U.S. cooperation with Germany and other NATO partners as they try to head off a potential invasion of Ukraine by Putin’s forces deployed on its borders.

The bill “would undermine the current diplomatic situation,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who had introduced earlier sanctions proposals with Cruz. “We are in a very different situation right now” than when two earlier bills were passed.

The Biden administration also has argued that imposing new sanctions on the undersea pipeline now could undercut the US’s ability to persuade other European nations to join in severe economic penalties later if Russia invades Ukraine.

The legislation “will not counter further Russian aggression or protect Ukraine,” Emily Horne, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement Wednesday. “Instead, it will undermine our efforts to deter Russia and remove leverage the United States and our allies and partners possess in this moment all to score political points at home.”

The White House backed an alternative plan from Senator Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, that would make the sanctions contingent on Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Nearly 40 senators have signed on to that bill.

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the pipeline is what’s divisive. Unlike an older Nord Stream pipeline, the new one bypasses Ukraine.

“The government of Germany should have shelved this project itself a long time ago,” McConnell said. “These sanctions, like the prior Nord Stream 2 sanctions that had overwhelming bipartisan support here in Congress, are not about driving a wedge in Europe. The pipeline itself is the wedge.”

McConnell called for a stronger stance against Russia, saying on the Senate floor that the US should extend additional humanitarian and military support to Ukraine.

“We must not pull our punches out of some fear of provoking Putin,” he said. “What will encourage Putin is if he senses American weakness.”

Construction of the new pipeline is essentially complete, but Germany has yet to issue the certification required for it to begin operating.

Where are Russian troops in Ukraine now?

An estimate of 190,000 Russian troops have been deployed in and around Ukraine for the invasion.

Russia has admitted around 10,000 of their troops have been killed.

Despite peace talks on the Belarusian border, the Ukraine war rages on with no hint of whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will withdraw his troops.

Russia has military control over much of Ukraine's southern regions but is fighting to take control of Mariupol.

RUSSIA LATEST

Which parts of Ukraine has Russia invaded?

Russia has made large sweeps in the south of Ukraine, using Crimea and the separatist supporters in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Troops moved into the Kherson region from Crimea - a territory that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Kherson and Melitopol areas of Ukraine are under control of Russian forces.

There is strong Russian presence in Chernobyl and the surrounding area.

Northern cities of Chernihiv and Konotop, which are closest to the Russian and Belarusian borders, have also been taken.

Why has Russia invaded Ukraine?

Unrest in the Donbas region began in 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea.

Pro-Russian demonstrations escalated into fighting with the Ukraine government forces.

The Minsk agreement of 2015 – between the separatist leaders, Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany – sought to end fighting in the region but without success.

The much feared Russian advance began in the early hours on February 21, 2022, soon after Putin announced he recognised Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states in a bombastic TV address.

Joe Biden and Boris Johnson condemned the move as an ""invasion"" and slapped sanctions on Russian banks and Putin's billionaire cronies.

 A FORMER spy alleges a body double stands in for Vladimir Putin at key events – and has revealed what he says are the tell-tale signs.

Sergei Zhirnov claims to have served alongside the Russian tyrant in the KGB intelligence service of the former Soviet Union, which is now known as the FSB.

Zhirnov said he had believed until now that claims of Putin using doppelgangers were “conspiracy theories”.

But he has now changed his mind, citing a speech made by a “skinny” and coughing Putin on February 21 and contrasting it with an appearance at a pro-war concert next day in Moscow as evidence.

Footage highlights him waving his hands around and repeatedly touching his nose, not traits especially common with Putin.

Zhirnov told Ukrainian TV that “a totally different Putin pops up” with “a wider face as if he bloated in 24 hours”.

""He has a totally different shape of eye orbits, a totally different head, absolutely different wrinkles - a different voice.”

Far from shunning people, perhaps to avoid Covid, he was “almost kissing and hugging everyone”.

His allegation comes as a video shows an unusually exuberant Russian president at a helicopter plant in Siberia.

Zhirnov is now exiled in France and was a former classmate of Putin at KGB Red Flag Institute, a spy training centre.

The claim Putin uses a body double has also been made by the head of Ukrainian military intelligence.

Major General Kyrylo Budanov claimed the body doubles are used to hide Putin’s loss of control in the Kremlin.

He claimed Ukrainian secret services detected Putin body doubles standing in for him on a number of ""special occasions"" in the past, but this had become ""usual practice"" now

""We know specifically about three people that keep appearing, but how many there are, we don't know,"" Budanov said.

""They all had plastic surgery to look alike.""

The spy chief alleged all the doubles had surgery but said the one thing that gives them away is their height.

“It's visible in videos and pictures. Also gesturing, body language and earlobes, since they are unique for every person.""

The claim that Putin uses body doubles is also regularly made by the General SVR Telegram and YouTube channel, which claims to be run by a Kremlin insider.

Most experts dismiss such claims as absurd and far-fetched, though several noticed Putin’s unusually buoyant mood in Siberia, compared to recent public appearances in Moscow.

One claim was that Putin had had an extra dose of medicine.

It has been alleged body doubles were used by former Soviet leaders Josef Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev.

Putin three years ago admitted that officials had considered using doubles, but he claimed the idea was rejected.

""I discarded the idea of any doubles,” he said.

He admitted the idea came up in the early 2000s when Russia was hit by terrorist attacks.

It was suggested a lookalike should take his place at events where the head of state might be at risk, he said.

 MOSCOW—Russia said on Sunday that the United States was responsible for a Ukrainian attack on Crimean peninsula with five U.S.–supplied missiles that killed four people, including two children, and injured 151 more.

The Russian Defence Ministry said four of the U.S.–delivered Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, equipped with cluster warheads, were shot down by air defense systems and the ammunition of a fifth had detonated in mid-air.

Footage on Russian state television showed people running from a beach and some people being carried off on sun loungers.

Russian authorities in Crimea said missile fragments had fallen just after noon near a beach on the north side of the city of Sevastopol where locals were on holiday.

The incident generated a furious reaction among Russian public figures.

The Defense Ministry said U.S. specialists had set the missiles’ flight coordinates on the basis of information from U.S. spy satellites, meaning Washington was directly responsible.

“Responsibility for the deliberate missile attack on the civilians of Sevastopol is borne above all by Washington, which supplied these weapons to Ukraine, and by the Kyiv regime, from whose territory this strike was carried out,” the ministry said.

Russia sent its troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

The United States began supplying Ukraine with longer range ATACMS missiles, which have a 300-kilometre (186-mile) range, earlier this year.

Treating the InjuredSevastopol Governor Mihail Razvozhaev put the death toll at four, with 144 injured, including 82 taken to hospitals. Twenty-seven children were among the injured.

Specialist doctors were being flown in from other parts of Russia.

Russia will respond to Sunday’s attack, the Defense Ministry said, without elaborating. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had been “in constant contact with the military” since the attack.

Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council, described the incident as “a vile, despicable act against our people.”

He likened it to attacks carried out by gunmen on Sunday against a synagogue, a church, and police post in Dagestan and said there was “no difference to us” between the U.S. administration, Ukrainian leaders, and “crazy fanatics.”

Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill said there “was no justification whatsoever for a missile strike on civilians” and expressed indignation that the incident occurred on the Orthodox holiday of Trinity.

Neither Ukraine nor the United States has commented on the attack, which came on a day when Ukraine said one person had been killed and 10 others wounded by Russian strikes on the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.",1,"['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: UA is anti-RU extremists', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
128,EN_CC_100172.txt,"How Do Animals React During a Total Solar Eclipse? 

 When a total solar eclipse transforms day into night, will tortoises start acting romantic? Will giraffes gallop? Will apes sing odd notes?

Researchers will be standing by to observe how animals’ routines at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas are disrupted when skies dim on April 8, The Associated Press reported. They previously detected other strange animal behaviors in 2017 at a South Carolina zoo that was in the path of total darkness.

“To our astonishment, most of the animals did surprising things,” said Adam Hartstone-Rose, a North Carolina State University researcher who led the observations published in the journal Animals.

While there are many individual sightings of critters behaving bizarrely during historic eclipses, only in recent years have scientists started to rigorously study the altered behaviors of wild, domestic and zoo animals.

Seven years ago, Galapagos tortoises at the Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, South Carolina, “that generally do absolutely nothing all day ... during the peak of the eclipse, they all started breeding,” said Hartstone-Rose. The cause of the behavior is still unclear.

A mated pair of Siamangs, gibbons that usually call to each other in the morning, sang unusual tunes during the afternoon eclipse. A few male giraffes began to gallop in “apparent anxiety.” The flamingos huddled around their juveniles.

Researchers say that many animals display behaviors connected with an early dusk.

In April, Hartstone-Rose’s team plans to study similar species in Texas to see if the behaviors they witnessed before in South Carolina point to larger patterns.

Several other zoos along the path are also inviting visitors to help track animals, including zoos in Little Rock, Arkansas; Toledo, Ohio; and Indianapolis.

This year’s full solar eclipse in North America crisscrosses a different route than in 2017 and occurs in a different season, giving researchers and citizen scientists opportunities to observe new habits.

“It’s really high stakes. We have a really short period to observe them and we can’t repeat the experiment,"" said Jennifer Tsuruda, a University of Tennessee entomologist who observed honeybee colonies during the 2017 eclipse.

The honeybees that Tsuruda studied decreased foraging during the eclipse, as they usually would at night, except for those from the hungriest hives.

“During a solar eclipse, there’s a conflict between their internal rhythms and external environment,” said University of Alberta's Olav Rueppell, adding that bees rely on polarized light from the sun to navigate.

Nate Bickford, an animal researcher at Oregon Institute of Technology, said that “solar eclipses actually mimic short, fast-moving storms,” when skies darken and many animals take shelter.

After the 2017 eclipse, he analyzed data from tracking devices previously placed on wild species to study habitat use. Flying bald eagles change the speed and direction they’re moving during an eclipse, he said. So do feral horses, “probably taking cover, responding to the possibility of a storm out on the open plains.”

The last full US solar eclipse to span coast to coast happened in late summer, in August. The upcoming eclipse in April gives researchers an opportunity to ask new questions including about potential impacts on spring migration.

Most songbird species migrate at night. “When there are night-like conditions during the eclipse, will birds think it’s time to migrate and take flight?” said Andrew Farnsworth of Cornell University.

His team plans to test this by analyzing weather radar data – which also detects the presence of flying birds, bats and insects – to see if more birds take wing during the eclipse.

As for indoor pets, they may react as much to what their owners are doing – whether they’re excited or nonchalant about the eclipse – as to any changes in the sky, said University of Arkansas animal researcher Raffaela Lesch.

“Dogs and cats pay a lot of attention to us, in addition to their internal clocks,” she said.

 Reporter who helped reveal assassination plot on Putin opposition figure Navalny ‘BANNED’ from BAFTAs

A REPORTER who helped to reveal the plot to murder Russian dissident Alexei Navalny has been ""banned"" from attending this weekend's BAFTAs.

Christo Grozev features in the 2022 film Navalny, which has been nominated for Best Documentary at the awards ceremony.

The film follows the story of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's poisoning in 2020 - and the subsequent efforts of Grozev and fellow investigative journalist Maria Pevchikh revealing the plot to kill the Russian opposition politician.

Navalny, one of Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics, survived the attempt on his life with a deadly nerve agent.

He is currently serving sentences totalling eleven-and-a-half years on charges including fraud and contempt of court.

Taken aback by the ruling, Grozev took to Twitter on Friday to inform his followers.

He said: ""I was surprised to discover that my whole family and I have all been banned by British police from attending this weekend's Bafta awards where the documentary #Navalny is nominated.

""The reason stated: 'We represent a public security risk'.

""I understand the need to keep the public safe (although I don't understand how my son or teenage daughter constitute risk to the public). But moments like this show the growing dangers to independent journalists around the world.

""These dangers don't stem just from murderous dictators, but also from having journalists' voices hushed - instead of amplified - by the civilised world they are trying to serve.""

In response to Grozev's online remarks, Met Police said that police forces generally ""do not and cannot"" ban individuals from attending events, and the decision will rest with the show's organisers.

Despite hand-wringing about ""hostile intentions of foreign states"" in the UK, Met Police said it could not comment on an individual's safety.

A statement read: ""We cannot comment on the safety of an individual or the advice they may have been given.

""However, the situation that journalists face around the world and the fact that some journalists face the hostile intentions of foreign states whilst in the UK is a reality that we are absolutely concerned with.

""We are committed to working with our intelligence partners to investigate these threats and to take other steps to ensure the safety of those concerned.""

The Met added: ""Despite our efforts, on protective security and on investigations, we recognise the impact of those threats on those affected.

""The responsibility for such threats and their potential impact on the wider public lies with the hostile state actors behind them and we have significantly increased the resources applied to bearing down on those.

""More generally, police do not and cannot ban anyone from attending a private event. Decisions about the attendance at an event is a matter for the event organisers.

""We recognise that our advice can mean organisers have difficult choices to make when deciding how best to mitigate any risks to the security of their event, and we are grateful for the ongoing engagement of Bafta.""

Christo Grozev is the lead Russia investigator for investigative group Bellingcat.

The Netherlands-based outfit's work focuses on “security threats, extraterritorial clandestine operations, and the weaponization of information,” according to their website.

Responding to Grozev's Twitter thread, Tory MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Alicia Kearns responded: ""I've raised with ministers - you are not the security risk.""

In a statement given to the PA news agency regarding security at Sunday's ceremony, Bafta said: ""The safety of all our guests and staff at the ceremony is always our highest priority, and we have robust and appropriate security arrangements in place every year.""

Bafta also confirmed that the film's producers Diane Becker, Shane Boris, Melanie Miller and Odessa Rae will be in attendance as nominees for Navalny.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday showed up in Kiev during an unannounced visit, and at an awkward moment for US-Ukraine relations given President Zelensky has been publicly complaining over a decrease in artillery shell supplies, given they are now going to Israel for its war in Gaza.

This is Austin's second trip to Kiev since the Russian invasion. ""I’m here today to deliver an important message – the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine in their fight for freedom against Russia’s aggression, both now and into the future,"" he said.

Just last week, CIA Director William Burns also made a secretive, unannounced visit to Ukraine to hold urgent meetings with Zelensky and top military and intelligence officials. Commentary in Asia Times has concluded that this flurry of activity is in response to how badly things are going on the battlefield. Washington has invested many tens of billions of dollars into what's clearly a 'proxy war' against Russia. Asia Times wrote:

Wednesday, November 15th is Z-Day for the War in Ukraine. CIA Chief William Burns will arrive in Kiev for urgent, secret meetings with Zelensky. It is worth asking: How come Burns is on an urgent mission to Ukraine?

The answer to the question is that Ukraine is imploding. The crumbling of the Zelensky regime is unsurprising: Ukraine has been sustaining far too many casualties to survive for much longer. Ukraine either must find a way to make a deal with Russia or face an internal rebellion.

Indeed, there have been recent media rumors and rumblings that Washington has begun to quietly push Kiev to the negotiating table. Was this in any way the focus of these new visits by Burns and Austin?

""The Russian strategy is to bleed-down Ukraine’s armed forces and create a political crisis in Kiev,"" the Asia Times report continued. ""The Russian effort is ahead of schedule, which has surprised Moscow as much as Washington.""

Zelensky has lately sacked and replaced many within his own war cabinet. All of this is a sign of deepening friction, also as Zelensky has admitted that the Gaza crisis has taken the international attention off of Ukraine's war efforts. This has led to waning monetary and weapons support as well.",1,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 New Delhi: Ahead of the presidential election in Nigeria, there has been an explosion of fake news across social media platforms. Divisive content on subjects like religion and ethnicity is also littered across social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and WhatsApp.

According to a report in Al Jazeera, “Social media allows Nigerians to share information in real-time, political strategists are weaponising this ahead of the forthcoming polls.”

A BBC report in January uncovered how Nigerian politicians secretly paid social media influencers as much as 20 million Nigerian naira ($43,000) or promised government contracts and political appointments to spread disinformation about opponents. Some of these influencers are also being recruited to “situation rooms” to monitor the spread of the fake news, the report added.

Meanwhile, Nigeria is grappling with widespread fuel shortages that are forcing motorists to spend hours in lines to buy gas and causing prices to surge for transportation and basic commodities.

Russia’s war in Ukraine has caused prices to import fuel go up by more than 100% but retailers complain they can only charge the price set by the government, causing them to operate at a loss.

The cost of transporting gasoline to the depots has gone up by 80% in the past few months.

Gasoline shortages are frequent in Nigeria even though the country is one of Africa’s biggest producers of crude oil.

However, the country must import most of its fuel because it has very few functioning refineries.

132,EN_UA_015443.txt,"Ukraine War: Kyiv’s allies fear military support will dry up in US election year 

 Ukraine’s Western allies are concerned that the military support for Kyiv may soon peak, as the US enters a divisive presidential, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing unnamed Western officials.

“Ukraine’s allies fear military support for its battle against Russia is nearing a peak, with senior European officials increasingly concerned about the flow of aid next year as the US enters a divisive presidential campaign,” the Financial Times reported.

According to the FT, Washington has been Kyiv’s major source of military aid. US officials interviewed by the newspaper say the remaining funds preapproved by Congress could sustain Ukraine for about another five months. Western officials in regular contact with the US over Ukraine told the FT that Washington sees that period of time as the last real chance for Kyiv to change the situation on the ground.

“We can’t keep the same level of assistance forever,” a European official told the British newspaper as he argued that the current level of support could be sustained for another year or possibly two years but no more.

Politico reported earlier this week that only $6 billion of the original $48 billion military aid package that the US had approved previously now remains. According to the US publication, Washington’s funds for Kyiv may be fully allocated by mid-summer.

European allies are increasingly uncertain about whether the US will come close to matching its existing $48bn package, adopted in 2022, particularly as it requires a vote in Congress this autumn against the backdrop of more partisan debate on the war, FT reported.

Recently, European leaders promised Zelenskyy an arsenal of missiles, tanks and drones during a whirlwind three-day visit to Italy, the Vatican, Germany, France and the U.K. that sought to replenish Ukraine’s depleted weapons supplies ahead of a long-anticipated spring offensive aimed at turning the tide of the war.

Zelenskyy’s energetic international diplomacy over 15 months of war has persuaded Ukraine’s Western allies to send ever more powerful weapons, from German Leopard tanks to U.S. Patriot missile systems and Storm Shadow cruise missiles from the U.K.

The war in Ukraine that began a year ago has killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes, reduced entire cities to rubble and has fuelled fears the confrontation could slide into an open conflict between Russia and NATO.

 The World Economic Forum in Davos has ordered global authorities to radically reduce the number of white people in the world by 2030.

If you thought the Great Replacement was nothing more than a conspiracy theory, you might want to think again.

According to a WEF report, white people are responsible for the vast majority of the world’s problems including climate change and colonialism, and in the interests of an equitable future for the globe, the number of white people must be reduced as a priority.

The WEF has enlisted the United Nations to help with the plan and the results are already playing out before our eyes.

Before we dive in, subscribe to the channel if you haven’t already, and join the People’s Voice Locals community to join our incredible community and support the channel.

The Netherlands has become one of the global elite’s testing grounds for the most extreme policies.

Just as the Netherlands was ground zero for the elite’s war on farmers, Dutch cities are also operating as laboratories for the elite’s plans to depopulate the world and radically alter demographics.

Eva Vlaardingerbroek reports from the Netherlands.

What is wrong with our leaders?

They are fully bought and paid for compromised reprobates who have hitched their wagon to the globalist agenda and take their orders directly from Davos.

Catching the elite in “mask off” moments is nothing short of terrifying.

Take for example footage of a top CDC official saying that the elites must “get rid of of all the whites in the United States” and replace them with immigrants to create a more compliant society.

Dr. Carol Baker was describing what she described as the “solution” at a panel discussion in New York City.

You won’t be surprised to hear that Baker was appointed Chair of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization by Barack Obama’s Health and Human Services Secretary in 2009.

She was also honored with the 2019 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal at a D.C. ceremony sponsored by Pfizer and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Is anyone surprised that a Bill Gates-connected CDC official is openly suggesting depopulating America of white people who don’t cooperate with the elite’s vaccine agenda?

This is the same Bill Gates who told world leaders that it’s time to talk about “death panels” that will sentence ordinary, law-abiding people to death for the crime of being of no use to the elite.

This is the psychopathic world Bill Gates and his associates at the WEF are determined to usher in as part of their Great Reset and Great Replacement.

It gets even worse when you understand how far and wide their evil ideology has spread.

The globalist elite are no longer hiding their plans to depopulate the world by reducing the number of white people. This is a multi-pronged attack and we are now seeing what it looks like in real time.

Of course, the mainstream media are still operating under instructions from the elite to attack anybody who dares to express what they can see with their own two eyes.

They will attack you, shout you down, and pressure your employer to fire you. You might lose your bank account.

You are simply not allowed to talk about the human tragedy of Biden and Harris’ open border, even though Biden is on record laying out his great replacement vision in 2015 in plain English for everybody to understand.

Biden is a compromised puppet politician who has been shamelessly selling out America to the globalists for decades.

Now that he has been sacrificed by the global elite in favor of Kamala Harris and appears to have been replaced by a body double who is approximately eight inches taller than the last version, it is worth pointing out that the elite think we are incredibly stupid.

They really think we are not paying attention to the mountains of evidence proving the multi-pronged attacks maiming and killing the population all have one thing in common.

Chemtrails and mRNA disproportionately target white people in a way that is statistically impossible unless it’s by design.

Of course the plot to depopulate the world has been planned out in detail. The Covid vaccines have long been exposed as a bioweapon designed to cull the herd and depopulate the world.

But it gets even worse, as Robert F. Kennedy explained in New York City. The bioweapon is targeted to take out white people and spare other races.

We can’t allow the evil logic of ethnic bioweapons to become the new normal.

 In response to EU's recent decision to ban Russian media outlets such as RIA Novosti news agency, Izvestia and Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspapers, the Russian authorities blocked 81 EU publications, including Politico, Spiegel, AFP and a number of others. Moscow promised to review the measure if the EU lifts the ban.

The Russian Foreign Ministry banned the broadcasting of 81 European media outlets in response to similar measures that the European Union earlier took against Russian media.

The most recent move will affect, in particular, Politico, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Der Spiegel (Germany), Yle (Finland), El País (Spain), EUobserver, LRT (Lithuania), the Estonian version of Delfi website and other media.

Moscow's measures come in response to the EU broadcast ban on RIA Novosti, Rossiyskaya Gazeta and Izvestia, as well as Voice of Europe for ""war propaganda.” Brussels found that the Russian government controls these media outlets and uses them to promote and support Russia's military operation in Ukraine, ""as well as to destabilise neighbouring countries.” The EU noted that the measure will not prevent media employees ""from carrying out activities in the EU, with the exception of broadcasting.”

EU's Russian media ban comes into force in the European Union on June 25.

""If restrictions on Russian media are lifted, the Russian side will also reconsider its decision in relation to the mentioned media operators,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Maria Zakharova, an official representative of the department, said on June 24 that Moscow developed responsive measures ""realizing that it was useless to hope for Brussels commitment to international legal obligations.”

Since the beginning of hostilities in Ukraine, the EU has banned broadcasting of a number of Russian media, including NTV/NTV Mir, Rossiya 1, REN TV, Channel One, RT and Sputnik. Certain EU countries, such as, for example, Latvia, banned the broadcasting of 80 Russian TV channels. YouTube channels of many Russian media outlets were also blocked. Pravda.Ru YouTube channel was blocked as well.

 Karachi - Unity Foods continues to showcase a strong commitment to ESG principles through a partnership with The Green Ark (TGA). A MoU was signed to this effect between both companies whereby TGA will collect and transform scrap materials from Unity Foods to create a diverse array of recycled products intended for reuse. The initiative aims to facilitate the circular economy by mitigating the impact of single-use plastics that contribute significantly towards the deterioration of global ecosystems.

Unity Foods regularly undertakes lasting projects that align with its objectives to reduce the impact of conventional industrialisation on the environment. Under the current partnership with The Green Ark, a leading recycling solutions provider, Unity Foods will not only ensure the traceability of its packaging waste but also highlight a robust commitment to a greener environment by contributing to the circular economy. With an average of more than 13,000 kilogrammes of waste every month including items like garbage debris, oily pouches, plastic jerry cans, tin scraps, plastic bags, and cardboard cartons, a substantial amount of materials will be recycled which will not end up in landfills or incinerators that ultimately damage nature.

“Global warming is a present and potent threat, especially for Pakistan which despite producing a negligible level of greenhouse gases, faces the brunt of the consequences of this global phenomenon. At Unity Foods, we always aim to set a precedent, particularly with our ESG practices that underscore our commitment to ensuring our children can inherit a safe and healthy planet. This partnership with The Green Ark is another step in this direction and we aim to continue commencing similar initiatives in the future,” commented Ms Nageen Rizvi, Head of Corporate Communications and Sustainability, Unity Foods at the signing ceremony. At the occasion, Mr Habib Elahi, CEO, The Green Ark said, “We are committed to reduce the carbon footprint through recycling waste into resin and building materials such as pavers and tiles made from end-of-cycle plastic waste.

 The United States knew in advance about the attacks on the Nord Stream pipeline, the largest act of industrial terrorism in history, but did not step in to prevent them, according to an interview with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski published today.

In September 2022, Sikorski, then a member of the European Parliament (MEP), insinuated that Washington was complicit in the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipeline.

Sikorski tweeted a photo from the scene of the crime and signed it “Thank you, USA.” The MEP also pointed out Joe Biden’s standing threat to demolish the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. However, his tweet was deleted just a few hours later.

Speaking with Polish news outlet Rzeczpospolita as the Polish foreign minister his week, Sikorski said “If we believe media, it [the attack] was carried out by someone who was interested in it. And the US had preliminary information about this and did not interfere with this move.”

However, Sikorski chose not name those responsible for the crime.

Almayadeen reports: US investigative journalist and Pulitzer award winner Seymour Hersh said on February 8 2023 that US Navy divers planted explosives to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022.

“Last June, the Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as BALTOPS 22, planted the remotely triggered explosives that, three months later, destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, according to a source with direct knowledge of the operational planning,” Hersh wrote in his Substack newsletter.

The White House responded and dismissed the claims as “false and complete fiction.”

Flightradar24 data showed in late September 2022 that US military helicopters habitually and on numerous occasions circled for hours over the site of the Nord Stream pipeline incident near Bornholm Island.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet China’s Xi Jinping for talks in Beijing in October, the Kremlin said on Tuesday, Putin’s first known trip abroad since an arrest warrant was issued against him over the deportation of children from Ukraine.

Nikolai Patrushev, a close Putin ally and the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, said Russia and China should deepen cooperation in the face of the West’s attempt to contain them both.

He was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that the talks in Beijing would be “thorough”, at a meeting in Moscow with China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi.

Putin will attend the third Belt and Road Forum after an invitation by Xi during a high-profile visit to Moscow in March.

Days before that visit, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for Putin’s arrest on suspicion of illegally deporting hundreds of children or more from Ukraine.

Moscow denies the allegations and the Kremlin said the warrant was evidence of the West’s hostility to Russia, which opened a criminal case against the ICC prosecutor and the judges who issued the warrant.

Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine early last year has triggered one of the deadliest European conflicts since World War Two and the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

Putin has pivoted towards China, and Xi has stood by him.

Chinese-Russian trade has soared since the invasion, and Russia has sold Asian powers including China greater volumes of the oil it can no longer sell to the West because of sanctions.

Putin last visited Beijing in February 2022, days before the invasion, where he and Xi announced a ‘no limits’ partnership. Moscow says this does not mean a military alliance, however.

The United States sees China as its gravest long-term “strategic competitor” and Russia as an “acute threat”.

China has refrained from condemning Russia’s operation against Ukraine or calling it an invasion, in line with the Kremlin, which casts the war as a “special military operation”.

 Actress Jane Fonda’s latest performance as a climate change activist drew a slew of criticism as she protested the Alberta oil sands in the Canadian province.

Fonda was castigated by locals, ambushed by a social media reporter and criticized by a left-leaning provincial premier. On Wednesday, at an Edmonton, Alberta news conference, she condemned a fellow-progressive, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying that “people shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking Liberals,” and accused him of “betraying” the Paris climate agreement.

Fonda claimed that, like President Barack Obama, her first impression of Trudeau was one of admiration: “When I heard that your prime minister, the shining hope at the … Paris climate talks, who talked so beautifully about needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty, and respect and hold to the treaties with the Indigenous people, and so forth — such a heroic stance he took there,” Fonda said. “And yet he has betrayed every one of the things that he committed to in Paris.

“I guess the lesson is we shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking liberals, no matter how well spoken they are. What a disappointment.”

But there was disappointment in the remarks of Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, who leads the left-leaning provincial New Democratic Party. She called Fonda “tone deaf” and “ill-informed.”

Fonda received an invitation from the Alberta government to discuss the oil sands but she refused.

“I would suggest if someone was going to come to Alberta … [and] fly over a city that is going through a significant economic downturn, that’s just been through the largest natural disaster in the history of Canada, and then lecture them about where they should get jobs elsewhere, first of all, that’s super tone deaf,” Notley said.

On the first day of her oil sands protest, as she strolled through nearby Fort McMurray, Fonda was ambushed by social media reporter Robbie Picard.

Picard, who hosts the Facebook group OilSands Strong, peppered Fonda with questions about the oil sands, asking her if she was aware of how many First Nations businesses have invested money in the project.

The episode was captured on video by a CBC journalist who was attempting to interview the actress. Fonda did not address any of the questions but insisted, “I’m on your side.”",1,"['CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures']",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 THIS is the horrifying moment Russia appeared to unleash flesh-melting ""thermite bombs"" on a Ukrainian town.

Terrifying footage shows the night sky in Marinka lit up by a chilling rain of sparkling, burning thermite - a killer chemical mixture.

The video, taken through a smashed window by someone sheltering inside a building, shows a huge area of the town in the Donetsk region being showered with the horror bombs.

Ukrainian journalists shared the video on Twitter - describing it as the ""scariest footage of thermite shelling"" they had ever seen.

Marinka is on the frontline of Putin's war in Ukraine as Moscow tries to gain control of the Donbas region - made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces.

Thermite, a mixture of metal powder and metal oxide, is used in the making of incendiary bombs.

It burns at temperatures of more than 2,400C - being so hot it can burn through steel and concrete.

And if it comes into contact with human flesh, it can melt through right down to the bone.

Human Rights Watch previously warned the deadly weapon can cause extremely painful burns on the human skin and can lead to respiratory problems.

The bombs use is significantly dangerous as their wide area of range means they cannot be contained on the battlefield - and its effects could hit civilians.

The killer weapons were used during the Second World War.

The use of thermite as an incendiary weapon is nowadays considered a war crime.

Its use was banned by the third protocol of the 1980 UN Convention on Conventional Weapons in Geneva.

Russia was previously accused of using phosphorus bombs in its effort to take over the Mariupol steel plant Azovstal in May this year.

Dramatic footage showed a Russian missile detonating mid-air above the plant with flaming explosives dropping down.

Ukrainian officials claimed the clip showed Russian forces dropping 9M22S incendiary and phosphorus bombs on the steelworks.

""Russia does not feel threatened"": Estonian Prime Minister calls for long-range missiles to be transferred to Ukraine

Western countries should provide the Armed Forces of Ukraine with all the weapons they need to liberate all the territories seized by Russia. First of all, Kyiv needs to be provided with long-range missiles.

This was the call to the West made by Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas in an interview with The Kyiv Independent published on Sunday, January 14. In her opinion, this is the only way to repel the aggressor country.

The head of the Estonian government reminded that Tallinn had officially decided to provide Kyiv with annual aid of 0.25% of its GDP over the next 4 years. She called on partners and allies to make the same decision.

Kallas said that the joint budgets of the countries that are members of the Ramstein format contact group on Ukraine's defense are ""much larger"" than Russia's budget.

""Every month, Moscow spends about 5.3 billion euros on the war. If we take the total budgets and this 0.25% of the GDP of all the states of the Ramstein coalition, it will be 120 billion. Such assistance would turn the tide in Ukraine's favor. The partners should provide Kyiv with all the military equipment they have,"" said the Estonian prime minister.

The absence of long-range weapons in the Ukrainian army gives the Russian occupation forces an advantage to seize more territories, Kallas noted.

""If they (Russians - Ed.) think they can win, then of course they don't feel threatened and just keep hitting Ukraine,"" the official said.

She also added that some Western countries are afraid that Moscow will lose and what consequences it will have. According to Kallas, the main task now is to end the war.

Speaking in the Estonian parliament on January 11, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine must win the battle against Russia because it is about the survival of the Ukrainian people.

As OBOZ.UA previously reported, the head of state called on the West to strengthen support for Ukraine. He emphasized that the Armed Forces of Ukraine need more shells, and they will move forward.

 If Finland decides to allow a “concentration” of troops on its border with Russia, it would be viewed by Moscow as a threat, the Kremlin said, after Poland offered to send military advisers to help Helsinki monitor the frontier.

The head of the Polish National Security Bureau, Jacek Siewiera, said in a post on social media X that Poland would send military advisers to its NATO ally Finland, in response to “an official request for allied support in the face of a hybrid attack on the Finnish border”.

“A team of military advisers will provide on-site knowledge on border security, also in operational terms,” he said.

Finland said on Thursday it was unaware of the Polish offer. It has closed its entire 1,340 km (833 mile) border with Russia for two weeks in a bid to halt an unusually large flow of asylum seekers that Helsinki says amounts to a “hybrid attack” orchestrated by Moscow, a charge the Kremlin denies.

Asked about the Polish offer to Finland during a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “This is an absolutely redundant measure to ensure border security because there is no threat there.”

“The Finns must be clearly aware that this will pose a threat to us - an increase in the concentration of military units on our borders.”

Any planned deployment would be unprovoked and unjustified, said Peskov.

Finland’s Border Guard and the interior ministry both said they were unaware of any plan to bring Polish military advisers to Finland’s eastern border.

Finnish President Sauli Niinisto held talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda in Warsaw last week but they did not discuss military cooperation on the Finnish border with Russia, Niinisto’s office said in a statement to Reuters.

 Russian Plot To Assassinate CEO Of German Arms Giant Dismissed As 'Fake' Intel Story By Kremlin

Top German government and political figures have reacted with outrage to a CNN report alleging that Russian intelligence had plotted to assassinate Armin Papperger, who is the head of Germany's biggest arms company Rheinmetall. The company is among the top European suppliers of 155mm artillery shells, tanks, armored vehicles, and other crucial military equipment to Kiev.

The Kremlin is calling it fantasy and pointing to zero evidence being presented alongside the major accusation. Here's how the bombshell CNN report published late this past week began: ""US intelligence discovered earlier this year that the Russian government planned to assassinate the chief executive of a powerful German arms manufacturer that has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine, according to five US and western officials familiar with the episode.""

There have been widespread allegations for several months in Western media pointing to an irregular and covert Russian warfare campaign to conduct sabotage missions against European defense and manufacturing companies supplying Ukraine.

The CNN report alluded to these prior stories: ""The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine’s war effort, these sources said."" It detailed further that ""The plan to kill Armin Papperger, a white-haired goliath who has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature.""

In recent months, there have been several instances of fires engulfing weapons and ammo manufacturing sites in the UK and on the European continent, some of which we detailed previously. Simultaneously, Russia has been subject of similarly mysterious blazes at defense contractor buildings and companies.

As for the alleged plot to take out the CEO of Rheinmetal, the CNN story is sourced entirely to anonymous intelligence officials, making it impossible to verify at this point, other than taking the word of US, German, and NATO officials.

According to more from the original CNN report, ""When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot. A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US.""

But Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations as 'fake news': ""It's all presented in the style of another fake story, so such reports cannot be taken seriously,"" he said at the end of the week.

Germany and the US reportedly foiled an alleged plot by Moscow to assassinate a leading German arms manufacturing firm's top executive. Why is Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger a target? pic.twitter.com/3tsi7jvxGU— DW News (@dwnews) July 13, 2024

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock belatedly appeared to confirm that the German government finds the warnings credible. ""In view of latest reports on Rheinmetall, this is what we have actually been communicating more and more clearly in recent months: Russia is waging a hybrid war of aggression,"" she had told a press briefing at the NATO summit in Washington.

Papperger himself has since described to the Financial Times that German authorities had imposed a ""great deal of security around my person"" - and he's now considered to be the most highly protected private citizen in all of Germany.

Another interesting aspect to the story is the timing: the CNN revelation corresponded precisely to the close of the annual NATO summit in D.C. at a moment Western officials urged the alliance to stay the course on Ukraine, and commit to supplying more weapons for years to come.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A top Russian military spy has been bombarded with sex toys after his personal email was hacked.

Ukrainian hackers claim they gained access to Sergey Morgachev's AliExpress account, ordering multiple sex toys and gay pride flags in his name.

The embarrassing hack was intended as ""a symbolic act of moral humiliation.""

Morgachev is Vladimir Putin's Lieutenant Colonel at Moscow's chief intelligence office, the GRU.

It is believed he was in charge of Russia's notorious ""Fancy Bear"" hackers, also known as APT28.

The hackers, who call themselves Cyber Resistance, claimed on Telegram that they had managed to break into Morgachev's email account.

Then, they were able to access personal information such as family photos and scanned documents of people associated with him, according to the open-source intelligence site Info Nampalm.

Referring to Morgachev in a message after the theft, the group said ""a very cool and clever hacker, but... We hacked him"".

The hack is considered to appear ""pretty credible"" by Ukrainian hacking expert Stefan Soesanto, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.

Info Nampalm reported that the hack confirmed Morgachev's identity by sifting through stolen personnel files.

Among these was a document that showed him to be a department head in Unit 26165.

The Russian hacker was accused by the FBI of holding the same position in 2018.

He is on the FBI's wanted list for his part in hacking senior US Democrats including Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump's presidential election in 2016.

It is said Morgachev and the GRU ""knowingly and intentionally conspired… to gain unauthorised access into the computers of US persons and entities involved in the 2016 US presidential election,"" according to a federal indictment filed by the Department of Justice.

In the document, he is described by the FBI as an officer in Russia's military spy agency, in a department ""dedicated to developing and managing malware.""

This was said to include the ""X-Agent"" spy software used to hack the DNC.

Microsoft later revealed in 2020 that the US election was targeted by the Russian group who launched attacks on people in both the Trump and the Biden campaign.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Although Ukrainians are doing everything they can to drive out the Russians, ""no one today can predict how long this war will last"", President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says.

""This will depend, unfortunately, not only on our people, who are already giving their maximum,"" he said on Friday in his nightly video address to the nation.

""This will depend on our partners, on European countries, on the entire free world.""

He said he was thankful to those who were working to strengthen the sanctions on Russia and increase military and financial support to Ukraine.

""This is the only recipe for protecting freedom in the face of the Russian invasion. And for Western countries, this is not simply an expense. This is not about accounting, it's about the future.""

Zelenskiy said Ukraine on Friday shot down the 200th Russian aircraft of the war and he noted Russia's heavy losses in tanks, armoured vehicles, helicopters and drones.

""And for what? So that the Lenin statue can stand for a bit longer in temporarily occupied Genichesk? There is and can be no other result for Russia.""

Russian forces in April restored the Lenin statue in Genichesk, a town in the southern Kherson region.

Zelenskiy said Ukraine was engaged in ""very difficult negotiations"" to try to evacuate the wounded fighters trapped in the Mariupol steelworks.

""We're talking about a large number of people. Of course, we are doing everything to evacuate all of the rest, each of our defenders. We have already brought in everyone in the world who can be the most influential mediators.""

Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces had retaken towns and villages from Russian troops. He said work was under way to restore electricity, running water, telephone communications and social services.

 Millions left with no aid as West Africa suffers worst hunger crisis in 10 years, U.N. says

The U.N. World Food Program said Wednesday that millions of hungry people in West Africa are without aid as the agency struggles with limited funding to respond to the region’s worst hunger crisis in a decade.

Nearly half of the 11.6 million people targeted for food aid during the June to August lean season are not receiving any assistance, the agency said in a statement. It warned that hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of joining armed groups, getting married early or engaging in “survival sex” in their desperation to survive.

“We’re in a tragic situation. During this year’s lean season, millions of families will lack sufficient food reserves to sustain them until the next harvests in September,” said Margot Vandervelden, WFP interim regional director for Western Africa. “We must take immediate action to prevent a massive slide into catastrophic hunger,” she said.

Long before last year’s flooding and Russia’s war in Ukraine, West Africa already was facing its worst food crisis in 10 years with more than 27 million hungry people mainly as a result of conflicts but also due to drought and the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

More than 50 million people in the wider East African region are expected to face acute food insecurity this year.

Food insecurity in West and Central Africa is now affecting 47.2 million people in this year’s lean season, when hunger peaks, the WFP said, with women and children the most vulnerable groups.

“Malnutrition rates have also surged, with 16.5 million children under 5 set to be acutely malnourished this year — an 83% rise from the 2015-2022 average,” the agency said.

In central Sahel countries of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger where jihadists have become increasingly deadly, U.N. agencies estimate that the number of people fleeing violence there has nearly quadrupled from 30,000 in January to 110,000 people in June.

“We need a twin-track approach to stop hunger in the Sahel — we must address acute hunger through humanitarian assistance while tackling the structural causes of food insecurity by increasing investments in resilient food systems and expanding government social protection programs,” Vandervelden added.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 The former head of German intelligence has revealed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President of Poland both collaborated to carry out the attack on the Nord Stream Pipelines.

The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were sabotaged on 26 September 2022 after a series of underwater explosions and gas leaks.

Modernity.news reports: Much of the legacy media initially blamed Russia for attack, claiming it was a false flag but offering no sensible reason as to why Moscow would target its own energy infrastructure.

However, during an appearance on German broadcaster WELT-TV, August Hanning, who served as the head of Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service (BND) from 1998 to 2005, the attack was carried out at the behest of Zelensky and Andrzej Duda.

According to Hanning, the act of sabotage occurred as a result of an “agreement between the highest officials in Ukraine and Poland.”

“There were agreements between Zelensky and Duda to carry out the attack,” said Hanning.

As we highlighted yesterday, Germany issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diver believed to be involved in the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines, but Polish authorities failed to stop him at the border and he is now believed to be back in Ukraine.

Berlin issued a European arrest warrant for Ukrainian citizen Volodymyr Z. after identifying him as the chief suspect for placing the explosives that destroyed the pipelines, but Polish authorities claimed they didn’t apprehend the suspect as a result of Berlin not including his name in a database of wanted persons.

The pipeline attack was preceded by warnings from the White House that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would spell the end for Nord Stream 2.

On January 27, 2022, Under-Secretary of State Victoria Nuland stated, “If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.”

On February 7, 2022, President Biden said, “If Russia invades… again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.”

In February 2023, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh published a report asserting that the pipelines were destroyed by the US as part of a covert operation.

According to Hersh’s sources, the explosives were planted in June 2022 by US Navy divers under the guise of the BALTOPS 22 NATO exercise and were detonated three months later with a remote signal sent by a sonar buoy.

It remains to be seen conclusively who ordered and carried out the attack, but the argument that Russia was behind it is looking increasingly tenuous.",1,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Distrust towards Media']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 The Washington Free Beacon reported that BioMADE, a public-private partnership that has received more than $500 million from the DoD, is responsible for the endeavor. BioMADE announced on its website on June 3 that it is looking for new ideas to reduce the CO2 emissions from food production and transport at military sites. These ideas include ""novel cell culture methods suitable for the production of cultivated meat or protein"" – essentially a euphemism for lab-grown fake meat.

Lab-grown meat is a new technology where animal muscle and fat tissues are grown from modified animal cells in special equipment. This process uses a mix of chemicals, pressure and temperature to create meat that resembles beef, chicken and pork. Though still in the experimental stage, lab-grown meat has sparked a debate about its efficiency and ethics of producing meat without killing animals. (Related: Lab-made chicken meat grown from CANCER CELLS receives FDA approval - Are you ready to eat TUMOR nuggets?)

But according to a 2023 study by researchers at the University of California-Davis, the carbon footprint of lab-grown beef might be worse than that of the product it seeks to replace. It zoomed in on the use of highly refined or purified growth media, which is used to help animal cells multiply. They wrote that lab-grown meat using purified media in its production has a global warming potential four to 25 times greater than the average compared to the real thing.

Critics argue that using U.S. troops to test lab-grown meat, which is still experimental and not widely available in stores, is inappropriate. Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved two California companies to sell cultured chicken to restaurants in 2023, some believe taxpayer money shouldn’t fund the lab-grown meat industry.

Jack Hubbard, executive director for the Center for the Environment and Welfare (CEW), was among the vocal critics of the plan. ""Taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund the lab-grown meat sector,"" he remarked.

""Our troops deserve better than to be served lab-grown meat, produced in bioreactors with immortalized cells and chemicals. Unfortunately, this effort is being driven by an agenda that is political and anti-farmer. Our soldiers should never be used as guinea pigs.""

Even Ethan Lane, vice president for government affairs at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, has criticized the DoD research grant that bankrolled BioMADE.

""It is outrageous that the DoD is spending millions of taxpayer dollars to feed our heroes like lab rats,"" he said in a statement. ""This misguided research project is a giant slap in the face to everyone that has served our country. Our veterans and active-duty troops deserve so much better than this.""

""U.S. cattle producers raise the highest-quality beef in the world, with the lowest carbon footprint – and American troops deserve to be served that same wholesome, natural meat and not ultra-processed, lab-grown protein that is cooked up in a chemical-filled bioreactor.""

 FACT CHECK: Viral X Image Purporting To Show Greta Thunberg Holding Anti-Semitic Book Is Digitally Altered

A viral image shared on X, formerly Twitter, purports to show 20-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg holding an anti-Semitic book.

— I,Hypocrite (@lporiginalg) November 28, 2023

Verdict: False

The image is digitally altered. In the original image, shared via Thunberg’s verified X account, she can be seen holding a copy of “The Climate Book.” A spokesperson for Thunberg confirmed the image was fake in an email to Check Your Fact.

Fact Check:

Thunberg has been criticized for chanting “crush Zionism” at a recent pro-Palestine rally in Sweden, according to the Times of Israel. Nigel Savage, founder of the Jewish non-profit Hazon, said Thunberg and other members of the political left “have been intellectually captured by a naive, distorted and frankly bigoted anti-Zionism,” the outlet reported.

The X image, viewed over 800,000 times, purports to show Thunberg holding an anti-Semitic book. “On The Jews And Their Lies,” the title of the book appears to read. The book is supposedly written by German priest and theologian Martin Luther.

The image is digitally altered, however. In the original image, shared via Thunberg’s verified X account, she can be seen holding a copy of “The Climate Book.”

“I’m so pleased to share that The Climate Book is now available in the USA and Canada! I have gathered the wisdom of over one hundred contributors to highlight the many different crises we face and equip us with the knowledge we need to avoid a climate disaster,” Thunberg wrote in the first of two posts promoting the book.

“This is the biggest story in the world, and it must be spoken as far and wide as our voices can carry and much further still. Thank you for your support!

I will not earn money from this book as my copyright belongs to the Greta Thunberg Foundation, so all royalties go to charity,” she added in the second post.

 Three days after Jamie Dimon sparked a marketwide selloff that sent stocks to fresh 2022 lows after he predicted a US recession in “6 to 9” months citing drivers including rising interest rates, persistent inflation, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and warned stocks could drop another 20%, the JPMorgan CEO who is expected to report earnings tomorrow (and hopefully clarify why his bank refuses to move its deposit rate above 0.01% in the process keeping $2.2 trillion in liquidity locked inside the overnight funding facility), doubled down today saying the Fed can’t cool the red-hot economy without bringing on a recession. [bold, links added]

…snip… In separate – and far more provocative -comments made earlier in the day during a JPMorgan investor seminar where he led a fireside chat moderated by JPMorgan’s Gergana Thiel, Dimon made some extremely outspoken comments that you won’t hear on the mainstream media, telling a small group of listeners that was closed to the press that the “President of the United States needs to stand up and say we may not meet our 2050 climate objectives because this is a fucking war.”

He also said, “time to stop going hat in hand to Venezuela and Saudi and start pumping more oil & gas in the USA.”

Echoing what he has said before, Jamie said this is the way the USA maintains its standing, as the future of the world is by pumping more oil and gas and using energy security to ensure Western unity.

And he did say when it comes to ESG that “investors don’t give a shit” warning not to “cede governance to do-gooder kids on a committee.”

Finally, he stressed the need for strong American leadership that is not being provided by either party. His conclusion: the world needs American diplomacy and neither Trump nor Biden can lead the USA.

Fundamentally, Mr. Dimon is right. Fossil fuels provide 80% of our domestic primary energy with an ongoing evolution that has taken about 120 years to build our modern, reliable & affordable domestic energy system. The “energy transition” will not be accelerated by government mandate or fiat. It will be dictated by the laws of physics and the energy imperatives of cost, energy/power density, scale & sustainability. So, Joe Biden can madate we will “openly defy gravity by 2050.” That does not mean we can IMPLEMENT it! We’d better get a fully informed, rational and civilzed debate on energy & attendant environmental policy started soon. Otherwise, the average Americans standard of living will continue to head south. Just ask anyone in the EU how the “Green Dream” is working out. With the current policy course, the U.S is only 2-3 years behind the same DISASTOROUS result…

Jamie Dimon speaks the truth and the Democrats don’t like that. Lower energy costs would lower inflation, but that would require new refineries and some backing from Washington that gives the explorers and drillers confidence. ESG is a money loser. Avoid any entity that promotes it.

(Xinhua/Guo Xulei)

BEIJING, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- China strives to make frontier breakthroughs in science and technology via the advancing computing power of artificial intelligence (AI) that has seen explosive growth in the country.

Scientists and AI developers applauded the revolution of AI-driven scientific research at the two-day AI for Science Summit in Beijing, which started on Thursday.

""AI development benefited from science,"" said Tang Chao, a professor from the Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies (AAIS) at Peking University, at the meeting. ""Now, we're looking forward to embracing a stage where AI facilitates scientific progress.""

AI for Science (AI4Science) can form an interdisciplinary platform and help scientists to solve complicated problems to improve research efficiency and quality, said E Weinan, president of the AI for Science Institute in Beijing.

AI4Science demands four pillars of infrastructure -- algorithm models and software, effective measures to represent experimental data, database and knowledge repository, and integrated computing platform, said E.

The Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Natural Science Foundation of China jointly kickstarted a project to promote the use of AI in frontier sci-tech research in March.

The project will deploy AI models and algorithms in gene research and biology breeding breakthroughs.

Also, interdisciplinary research and development teams will be brought together to promote the establishment of an innovation consortium and build international academic exchange platforms to offer solutions to human scientific challenges, including cancer treatment and the climate crisis.

E said AI4Science might bring revolutionary changes in new materials, energy, aviation, and pharmaceuticals.

Using AI and one of the world's fastest supercomputers, Chinese scientists have already started to engineer otherwise unknown chemicals to be clinically used in the future.

With the Tianhe-2 supercomputer in south China's Guangdong Province, scientists and computer experts with Beijing-based AI startup Galixir developed a practical deep-learning toolkit to predict the biosynthetic pathways for natural products, the primary source of clinical drug discovery.

Empowered by AI-based algorithms, the computer also offers clinicians tools to discern types of gastric cancer and discover signs of nasopharynx cancer among high-risk populations.

The new application scenarios are also a source of opportunities for the AI industry.

 MSM Admits ""Magical Thinking"" Guided Its Reporting On Ukraine... Many Thousands Of Deaths Later

A very short while ago, any US politician or media pundit publicly calling for peace negotiations in Ukraine with Russia's Putin was branded 'pro-Kremlin' and somehow compromised. For example, mainstream media has sought to isolate and cancel thinkers like John Mearsheimer for his realism toward Moscow and the conflict, and urging immediate ceasefire which would require territorial concessions from Kiev. It was only in September that one prominent publication branded him ""the world's most hated thinker.""

But now, at a moment Ukraine's leadership itself has become more desperate while admitting its forces are facing almost insurmountable odds, the D.C. beltway consensus has clearly and drastically changed, and now it's apparently okay to admit the following...

The War Street Journal acknowledges that the narratives it’s been pushing for months — of a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, a possible palace coup in Moscow, a Russian economy in tatters — are “Magical Thinking.” In other words, their coverage has been a fraud. pic.twitter.com/ZxB25W61Kn— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 16, 2023

The WSJ piece actually calls for a longer-term strategy of confronting Russia, while also admitting that Washington's approach thus far has been based on ""magical thinking"".

Or else we might just call the establishment narrative to this point fraudulent:

What Western leaders conspicuously haven’t done is level with their publics about the enduring nature of the threat from an emboldened, revisionist Russia. They have indulged all too often in magical thinking—betting on sanctions, a successful Ukrainian counter-offensive or the transfer of new types of weapons to force the Kremlin to come to the negotiating table. Or they have hoped to see Putin overthrown in a palace coup.

Elsewhere in the article, the authors point out that contrary to how the Wagner rebellion was widely presented in Western press, the reality is that whole episode actually strengthened Putin:

As Russian President Vladimir Putin looks toward the second anniversary of his all-out assault on Ukraine, his self-confidence is hard to miss. A much-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive has not achieved the breakthrough that would give Kyiv a strong hand to negotiate. Tumult in the Middle East dominates the headlines, and bipartisan support for Ukraine in the U.S. has been upended by polarization and dysfunction in Congress...

Putin has reason to believe that time is on his side. At the front line, there are no indications that Russia is losing what has become a war of attrition. The Russian economy has been buffeted, but it is not in tatters. Putin’s hold on power was, paradoxically, strengthened following Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed rebellion in June. Popular support for the war remains solid, and elite backing for Putin has not fractured.

The tragedy is that so many people from both sides died for a year for nothing— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 16, 2023

Of course, none of this has stopped Zelensky as well as his friends in US Congress from seeking to push through more billions in American taxpayer aid for Ukraine.

On a global level too, Moscow has made inroads and gotten closer with other well-armed powers who find themselves in Washington's crosshairs...

Zelensky has recently complained that ""Russia's goal"" to take the global focus away from the Ukraine war is working, particularly against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas conflict and rising tensions in the Middle East. But certainly for now, Ukraine has taken a far backseat among the list of current Biden administration priorities, it seems. Perhaps indeed there's less ""magical thinking"" these days.

157,EN_CC_100203.txt,"IMF’s Climate Call 

 The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recent call for enhanced transparency in Pakistan’s budgetary considerations for climate adaptation is timely and crucial, coinciding with the nation’s active pursuit of international support at COP28 in Dubai. As caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar leads Pakistan’s representation, transparency emerges as a cornerstone for effective policy-making and attracting climate-related financing.

The IMF’s recommendation to make the FY 2024-25 budget a turning point for climate adaptation planning underscores the imperative to integrate climate considerations into financial decisions. Seeking transparency on climate-related actions with budgetary implications aligns with the global recognition of the need to harmonise financial decisions with climate goals. This emphasis reflects an acknowledgment that fiscal sustainability analysis under diverse climate change scenarios is vital for informed decision-making.

Despite capacity constraints, the urgent call to train staff for climate initiatives underscores the necessity of investing in the nation’s ability to navigate climate challenges. Strengthening the capacity of relevant ministries, including the Ministry of Climate Change, Planning Commission, and Climate Change Authority, aligns with broader goals such as achieving National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) and National Determined Contributions (NDC) targets.

The IMF’s recommendation to publish climate-related spending for FY 2023-24, coupled with advancing green budgeting, signifies a commitment to transparency and accountability. Extending the green tracking system to all provinces, supported by the controller general of accounts, emphasises the need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach.

As part of the ongoing $3 billion standby arrangement, fulfilling the structural benchmark regarding climate public investment plans is crucial for meeting international commitments. Strengthening the appraisal process for investments and projects, including specific guidance on climate factors, ensures comparability and alignment with climate targets. The IMF’s holistic advice to adapt the entire budget formulation and approval process to climate change requirements signifies a forward-looking approach.

158,EN_UA_014014.txt,"End overseas trade settlement in dollar, use your own currency: Brazil President Lula to BRICS nations 

 Beijing: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has called for the BRICS nations to give up US dollar and come up with their own alternative currency to settle cross-border trade.

During his first state visit to China since taking office in January, Lula also lashed out the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and criticised the outsize role of the greenback in global trade.

His comments came mere days after the Brazilian government ditched dollar as an intermediary and announced a deal to trade in local currency with China.

Lula voices for de-dollarization

Lending his voice to China’s efforts to shed the dollar’s dominance and promote the use of the renminbi (RMB)/ yuan in overseas trade settlement, the Brazilian President said: “Who was it that decided that the dollar was the currency after the disappearance of the gold standard?”

“Why can’t we do trade based on our own currencies?” he said during his address at the New Development Bank in Shanghai, known as the “BRICS bank”.

“Every night I ask myself why all countries have to base their trade on the dollar,” Lula added.

It is being said that at the BRICS annual summit in South Africa, the member countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – will create a new currency to facilitate overseas trade. The final agreement could come up as early as in August this year.

As per reports, Russia is behind the idea of the alternative currency as it continues to face economic sanctions from the West over its invasion of Ukraine.

Don’t chase dollars

“Why can’t a bank like the BRICS bank have a currency to finance trade between Brazil and China, between Brazil and other BRICS countries?… Today, countries have to chase after dollars to export, when they could be exporting in their own currencies,"" Lula said.

Hitting out at the IMF, Lula alluded to accusations the global lenders’ overly harsh spending cuts on cash-strapped countries like Brazil’s neighbour Argentina in exchange for bailout loans.

“No bank should be asphyxiating countries’ economies the way the IMF is doing now with Argentina, or the way they did with Brazil for a long time and every third-world country,"" he said.

“No leader can work with a knife to their throat because (their country) owes money,"" he added.

Brazil-China trade

Trade between Brazil and China soared over the past decade to $150.4 billion in 2022.

China imports agricultural commodities and minerals from Brazil apart from investing in the Latin American country’s consumer market and infrastructure sector.

Earlier this week, the Brazilian branch of the state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China settled its first overseas transaction directly in RMB in the country. With the increase in bilateral trade and growing economic relationship, both countries have now been using their respective currencies to settle payments.

Can yuan be the new dollar?

The Chinese yuan’s role in trade finance has more than doubled since the Ukraine war, but at present, it is a poor contender to replace the US dollar as the global currency.

Not only is it virtually pegged to the dollar, China’s tight control of its currency keeps it from adhering to free market flows.

 Warning US could be ‘hit with most debilitating strike EVER’ in space war with Russia after chilling ISS threat

THE US could be hit with the most debilitating and destructive strike ever in a potential space war with Russia, an expert warns.

Relations between Moscow and Washington have plunged to new lows amid the Ukrainian crisis, and Russia’s space agency warned that US sanctions could “destroy” cooperation on the International Space Station.

Moscow claimed Washington needs its cooperation to prevent the ISS from falling on the US or Europe.

Geopolitical and space expert Brandon J Weichert told The Sun that Moscow has a decade to a 12-year advantage on the US in the galaxies.

He said US defenses are in “no way fit” to deal with the challenges posed by Russia.

Weichert warned: “We are going to get hit very hard soon in space. It is going to be the most debilitating strike on America, possibly ever.

“And we may not recover from it in a timely fashion. This could be how we lose our first war on Earth is losing the war in space.”

Weichert slammed the ""arrogant"" DC political class, claiming they didn’t foresee any rival challenging Washington’s dominance in the post-Cold-War world.

He said: “They thought there would never be a need for any kind of preventative or security measure because we thought we would always be dominant, and we thought no one would be crazy enough to challenge us.

“Well here we are 30 years later, and you have Russia, China, North Korea, and even Iran showing us that it was the wrong assumption.”

The expert feared that the US has a 60 percent chance of being pushed out of space by its rivals completely.

President Biden unleashed a package of sanctions against Moscow on Thursday after Putin’s forces rolled into Ukraine.

And, an additional 7,000 troops will be sent to Eastern Europe to bolster Nato’s defenses.

Russia’s invasion of the besieged nation saw Europe plunged into its biggest crisis since World War II.

Experts claim the world has not seen a crisis since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s.

The flashpoint was the closest point the world came to a full-blown nuclear war.

US intelligence feared that Kyiv could fall within 96 hours and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it’s a “possibility” that Putin could move beyond the borders of Ukraine.

The Russian strongman may feel emboldened and seek to move on to other nations if successful.

Troops have reportedly already been spotted in the Belarussian city of Brest – 10 miles east of the Polish border.

Biden told reporters Thursday: “He has much larger ambitions. He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is all about.”

Weichert said: “If Putin suspects the West will prop up a formidable anti-Russian resistance in a post-invasion Ukraine, he will risk not only nuclear war but also will threaten to attack US assets in space and the ISS.

“Putin fully understands the concept of asymmetrical warfare.”

He speculated that Moscow will ramp up its threats in cyberspace and nuclear warfare.

PUTIN'S THREATS

In December, Weichert warned that Moscow is plotting to launch a Pearl Harbor attack on the US in the cosmos.

The Pearl Harbor attack of December 1941 left America reeling as Japanese forces bombed the US naval port.

In his book, Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower, Weichert says that Russian co-orbital satellites, known as space stalkers, have been tailgating US satellites for years.

He predicts that the stalkers will eventually hit the satellites, sending them crashing into the ground.

Weichert believes Russia is preparing to launch a ""devastating"" attack on American satellites at the time of its own choice.

He warned that before launching an attack on Washington’s satellites, Moscow would ""engage in a series of escalations” with neighboring nations.

Russia conducted an anti-satellite weapon test (ASAT) in November where it destroyed one of its own satellites that had been in orbit since 1982.

Blinken branded the test ""dangerous and irresponsible"" as it created a field of 1,500 pieces of debris, forcing the ISS crew to take shelter.

State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the test marked an increase in the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS.

 by Prof Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research:

The World Economic Forum (WEF) which represents the Western financial elites, played a key role in the launching of the March 11, 2020 corona lockdown, which was conducive to a Worldwide process of economic and social chaos. It also played a key role in the launching of the Covid-19 vaccine. in November 2020.

And now they are “promising” us a crisis which is “Much Worse than Covid”.

Over the last three years the deliberate triggering of chaos has become part of a broad and complex agenda: the war in Ukraine, the hike in energy prices, the triggering of bankruptcies, the collapse of economic activity, widespread poverty, famine and despair.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

In recent developments, Washington has endorsed Israel’s genocide directed against the People of Palestine, coupled with an unfolding US-NATO-Israel military agenda against the broader Middle East.

Cyber-Attacks

The article below focusses on the imminent dangers of Cyber Warfare, which have already been announced by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

In 2021, the WEF conducted a simulation of Cyber Attacks involving a scenario of Paralysis of the Power Supply, Communications, Transportation, The Internet.

Klaus Schwab intimated in no uncertain terms based on “a simulated scenario” that a cyber-attack:

“Could bring a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole …

The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyberattack.” (emphasis added)

What does Schwab have up his sleeve?

A “Cyber Terrorist Attack” conducive to unprecedented disruptions? Is this something that we should take seriously?

A renewed fear campaign, a warning of an impending danger? In the words of Jeremy Jurgens, who is the WEF’s Managing Director:

“I believe that there will be another crisis. It will be more significant. It will be faster than what we’ve seen with COVID. The impact will be greater, and as a result the economic and social implications will be even more significant.” (emphasis added)

The 2021 WEF cyber polygon simulation scenario had an obvious “contradictory” geopolitical slant:

The event was chaired by Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, numerous Russian financial institutions, media and communications entities had been invited by the WEF.

Forty-eight countries participated in the Event, there were 41 partners of which 10 were from Russia and Kazakhstan: these included News Agency TASS, NTV, Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank and a leading global financial institution, the Mail.ru Group, Russia’s largest internet provider, MTS, Russia’s leading telecommunications group, the State Legal Department of the Omsk Region, Siberia. Powerful banking financial institutions from Kazakstan. Among others.

See also the assumptions of the Training Program, which are predicated on terrorist cyber hackers.

Amply documented, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has been instrumental in endorsing US-NATO’s military agenda in regards to Ukraine.

Was this July 2021 Cyber Polygon event (which occurred less than 8 months prior to the outset of the Ukraine War) intent upon creating political divisions within the Russian Federation by establishing partnerships with a number of powerful Russian media, communications, banking and financial institutions, etc.

Not a single representative from the People’s Republic of China. Was the Cyber Polygon Simulation (July 2021) intended to foster confrontation between China and Russia? Are Cyber attacks contemplated as part of a Global Military agenda?

The Process of “All-Digitization”

In November 2023, as documented in an article by Peter Koenig, the Financial Elites passed from the “study of scenarios” to “implementation”.

British colonel: Ukrainian operation in Kursk region humiliated Putin and showed cowardice of allies

The first major attack on Russian territory since World War II, the Ukrainian Armed Forces' offensive in the Kursk region, has publicly humiliated Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. However, he is not the only one who was humiliated and stunned by the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian territory. Ukraine's partners, among those who provide weapons but restrict their use, are in the same position.

This is the opinion of Colonel Richard Justin Kemp, a retired British Army officer and knight, who was awarded the highest honor in the UK. In his opinion, the Ukrainian offensive ""showed the cowardice of the allies,"" especially US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Sir Richard Kemp recalls how President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously asked Western partners to allow the use of long-range weapons to protect both Ukrainian soldiers and Ukraine in general.

""The British Storm Shadow missiles could make a difference in this battle, but the British government is unwilling to allow them to be used to their full potential. What, in Sir Keir Starmer's opinion, is the point of a strike on Russian territory, apart from protecting Ukraine? And how would the Second World War have ended if the Prime Minister had not allowed British and American bombs to fall on German soil?"" asks the colonel.

According to Sir Richard Kemp, throughout the entire period of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, ""the most pathetic were the Western allies"" who pursued a policy not based on Ukraine's defense needs, ""but on the groundless fear of Russian retaliation."" And although all of Putin's so-called red lines turned out to be nothing more than baseless intimidation, each subsequent Western decision to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, tanks, or combat aircraft ""was reluctant, half-hearted, inadequate, and gripped by fear.""

Incidentally, it was these fears and the ""miserable policy"" of the partners that ensured the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, the Briton believes.

""Ukraine was able to launch an unexpected attack on Russian territory because most of the border with the enemy was left almost unguarded. The fact is that Putin knew that his territory remained virtually invulnerable to attack because of Western restrictions on the use of weapons. This also applies to airfields, supply routes, and logistics bases. Significant forces needed to protect them have been thrown into the war in Ukraine,"" the colonel said.

""What Western leaders don't realize is that when you're facing a tyrant like Putin, escalation is the only language he fears and understands. We see the same thing in the Middle East, where Biden is pleading with Israel to de-escalate. But his unconvincing 'no' will not stop Ayatollah Khamenei from pushing the button and launching Iran's expected missile attack, just as it did not stop Putin from attacking Ukraine,"" Sir Richard Kemp said.

Ukraine's offensive near Kursk has taught the West a ""salutary lesson,"" the military said.

""Despite the capture of thousands of square kilometers of Russia's holy shrines, no nuclear missiles were raining down on Kyiv. The truth is that if Ukraine had been allowed to escalate from the very beginning, it could have brought this war to an end on favorable terms for Kyiv,"" the British colonel believes.

162,EN_UA_001052.txt,"NATO ‘Cautiously Optimistic’ Amid Reports of Russian Troop Withdrawal 

 After Russia announced Tuesday that it will pull out some troops from near the Ukrainian border, top NATO officials expressed that they are “cautiously optimistic” for a de-escalation of tensions.

“There are signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue. This gives grounds for cautious optimism. But so far we have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday morning following Russia’s announcement.

Russia did not say how many units were being withdrawn, and how far, after a build-up of some 130,000 Russian troops to the north, east, and south of Ukraine. Video footage posted online by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Tuesday allegedly showed Russian tanks moving back to their permanent bases and away from the border.

NATO said that it has yet to see evidence of a de-escalation in the crisis.

“Russia has amassed a fighting force in and around Ukraine unprecedented since the cold war. Everything is now in place for a new attack,” Stoltenberg said. “But Russia still has time to step back from the brink, stop preparing for war and start working for a peaceful solution.”

The Kremlin said Tuesday’s developments were proof that Western talk of war had been both false and hysterical.

“February 15, 2022 will go down in history as the day Western war propaganda failed. Humiliated and destroyed without a single shot fired,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement, according to Reuters.

On Monday, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko told Russian media the United States and the West are trying to “spark a conflict” with recent statements about a possible invasion.

“Look, if we planned any war against Ukraine, the media would have behaved completely differently. Because the media is the modern war’s bombardments,” he said.

France said it had yet to confirm the return of some Russian troops to bases, though this would be a positive sign. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, on the latest Western diplomatic mission to defuse the crisis, met Putin in the Kremlin.

Over the past weekend and on Monday, White House officials called on Americans to leave Ukraine and asserted that an invasion could occur in the near future. No evidence was provided for the second claim.

The U.S. Department of State also shut down its embassy in Kyiv and moved it to Lviv, located in the western part of Ukraine.

“We are in the process of temporarily relocating our Embassy operations in Ukraine from our Embassy in Kyiv to Lviv due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

“These prudent precautions in no way undermine our support for or our commitment to Ukraine. Our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering,” Blinken added, noting that “the path for diplomacy” is available.

Around the same time, confusion was sparked when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a statement on Facebook that said Russia would invade on Feb. 16. However, his office later said that he made the remarks sarcastically in an apparent attempt to make light of various Western intelligence reports suggesting an imminent invasion.",1,['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader'],['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

“The good news is that once we get to true net zero and stop adding, the temperatures will stop going up almost immediately, with a lag of as little as three years,” Al Gore said without providing any evidence whatsoever to back up his new timeline.

Gore continued, “And if we stay at true net zero half of the human cause to greenhouse gas pollution will fall out of the atmosphere in as little as 25 to 30 years, but getting there is very tough.”

On December 13, 2008, junk scientist Al Gore predicted the North Polar Ice Cap would be completely ice-free in five years.

And, with this lie, the global warming hysteria began.

Gore made the prediction to a German audience on December 13, 2008. Al warned them that “the entire North ‘polarized’ cap will disappear in 5 years.” The Gateway Pundit reported on this at the time.

This wasn’t the only time Al Gore made his ice-free prediction. Gore had been predicting the dire scenario since 2007. That means that the North Pole should have melted completely over a decade ago by now.

Al Gore also made the same prediction in 2009.

164,EN_CC_200021.txt,"NYC to begin tracking food purchases to make sure residents don’t consume “too much” meat 


Just as he promised to do, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a left-wing Democrat, is going after people’s meat with new plans to save the world from “climate change” by forcing everyone to become a “plant-based” vegetarian or vegan.

Along with representatives from the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy and the Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, Adams has announced the launch of a new “carbon footprint” and household food consumption tracking scheme that aims to reduce the Big Apple’s “carbon emissions” by 33 percent by the year 2030.


In order to cut all that carbon, Adams and his allies are imposing new “caps on meat” that, as the name suggests, will limit the amount of meat that New Yorkers are allowed to purchase and consume at public institutions – and eventually within their own homes as well.

(Related: Last month, we warned you that Adams was planning to unleash a horrific new food policing apparatus against New Yorkers, and now he has.)

Eric Adams wants all New Yorkers to become vegans

At a pre-Earth Day event held at a Brooklyn culinary center run by NYC Health + Hospitals, the city’s public health care system, Adams unveiled a chart depicting New York City’s greenhouse gas inventory. This inventory supposedly tracks the carbon footprint generated by household food consumption.

With the help of American Express, C40 Cities, and EcoData, Adams revealed carbon emissions data about household food consumption, which was added to existing carbon emissions data on energy use, transportation, and waste.

Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala from the NYC Department of Environmental Protection unveiled the new household food consumption data. Aggarwala, by the way, also founded the Google smart city subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, which collects data in order to forge “a new standard for what cities have to do” as a novel way to shape policy.

While the inventory that Aggarwala presented will also now include greenhouse gas “pollution” from the production and consumption of consumer goods like clothing, air travel, and health care, Adams focused his efforts at the event specifically on the foods that New Yorkers consume – mainly meat and dairy, which he personally opposes.

“Food is the third-biggest source of cities’ emissions right after buildings and transportation, but all food is not created equal,” Adams unsubstantially stated. “The vast majority of food that is contributing to our emission crisis lies in meat and dairy products.”

“It is easy to talk about the emissions that’s coming from buildings and how it impacts our environment, but we now have to talk about beef. And I don’t know if people are ready for this conversation.”

Other than fish, Adams reportedly abides by a “plant-based” vegan diet, which he says helped him overcome diabetes. He wrote a vegan cookbook to promote his personal dietary choices, which he now wants all New Yorkers to follow in order to stop “global warming.”

“We already know that a plant-powered diet is better for your physical and mental health, and I am living proof of that,” Adams declared. “But the reality is that thanks to this new inventory, we’re finding out it is better for the planet.”

The simplistic way in which Adams couched his argument against meat and dairy has already been debunked by people who are actually educated in such things, including Melissa McKendree, PhD, an agricultural economist at Michigan State University.

“Different meats have different kinds of greenhouse gas footprints,” McKendree clarified about how pasture-raised animals do not harm the environment like feedlot animals do. “All land is not created equal.”",1,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other']",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And it's worth digging a little deeper into the issues behind the net-zero issue, that being the advocacy for net zero carbon emissions, something that is all but impossible. Why? Because of the things required for the manufacture of electric vehicles (EVs); specifically, their batteries and, even more specifically, the raw materials required to make those batteries.

This brings us to Indonesia and the environmental havoc that mining for nickel, an essential component of EV batteries, is wreaking on that country.

Swathes of rainforest and coastal communities are being destroyed by a nickel mining boom in Indonesia sparked by the race to transition away from fossil fuels.

Across the country, a major drive to exploit the country’s abundant natural resources is underway. These photographs capture the sheer scale of the production process.

Rows of chimneys, belching smoke and fumes, tower over the schools and houses of what were once rural communities in scenes recalling the work of L.S. Lowry, whose paintings captured life in the industrial districts of North West England in the mid-20th century.

Indonesia is now the world’s largest nickel producer, with 15 per cent of the globe’s lateritic nickel resources – typically low-grade deposits found near the surface.

But demand is still soaring in tandem with the rise of the electric vehicles (EVs), which depend on it for their batteries.

Guess who is, in large part, funding all this?

Billion dollar Chinese firms anchor the nickel market in Indonesia, but they are often fed cheap ore by hundreds of smaller, mostly locally-owned mines that dot the rainforest. These mines have transformed once-peaceful agrarian villages and communities, providing economic opportunity but a health and environmental crisis looms from pollution.

In just three years, Indonesia has signed more than a dozen deals worth more than $15 billion for battery materials and electric vehicle production with global manufacturers including Hyundai, LG and Foxconn.

Granted, nickel extraction will probably go on regardless of the EV push, regardless of the net-zero goals of climate scolds, and we should remember that extraction and refining bring jobs to impoverished communities in Indonesia. That's not the point that we should be examining here.

It's the hypocrisy of the climate scolds ignoring these inescapable consequences of their agenda that's galling.

That's always been the whole problem with these people; they never count the cost, all the costs, of the agenda for which they advocate. They are of a kind with (and in many cases are the same people) who complain about, say, my going into the woods to shoot a grouse or a snowshoe hare for supper, demanding to know why I can't get my meat at a grocery store so no animal has to die. They are of a kind with the ""Stop Oil"" protesters who block traffic for hours, forcing people to sit with their car engines idling, pouring still more exhaust into the air. They are of a kind with the Greta Thunbergs of the world, ill-informed scolds who want to dictate the end of our modern, technological lifestyles.

They never figure situations like the mining of nickel for EV batteries in Indonesia into their calculus, any more than they account for the mining of cobalt with slave labor in Congo, or mining for lithium and its accompanying environmental disturbance.

To put it bluntly, they are hypocrites of the worst sort. Why do they ignore these problems with their policies? Is it just because these particular environments are far away and out of sight of these mostly affluent, mostly Western activists?

Or are they just ignorant?

 Putin’s unwillingness to use sufficient force to end a conflict that should not have lasted one week is leading to much wider war.

NATO at the summit in Vilnius is likely to approve plans to increase the number of troops in a state of high alert to 300,000, as well as other changes in the military structure, said Secretary General Stoltenberg.

Plans to increase the number of its rapid reaction forces to more than 300 thousand. people from 40,000. Stoltenberg said in June 2022. He noted that this will take place within the framework of the implementation of new regional plans.

In May, Stoltenberg said that these plans would be described as a bloc to deter and protect NATO allies from any aggression: they contain precise demands for the transformation of the armed forces, including their deployment. The Secretary General also announced more Allied exercises, bringing more forces into combat readiness, strengthening the command structure and control in the alliance.

As reported in March, the increase in the number of the military may imply the emergence of two echelons. The first will be 100,000. soldiers ready to be sent within ten days. The second echelon is reinforcements, that is, the military sent for support, they will have to be ready for the transfer within 10-30 days.

The Spanish El Pais reported in May that the bloc was finalizing a common strategy to counter the threat from Russia and terrorism. This strategy, according to sources of the publication, is changing NATO’s approaches to deploying forces in different regions and responding to threats from Moscow.

 Letters to the Editor: Oil companies are killing the planet. Now they want to sell us a fake solution?

To the editor: Let’s recognize “carbon management” for what it is — a fossil fuel industry euphemism for commodifying pollution and providing life support to this dirty industry. While urgent action is needed to address the climate emergency, carbon capture is not a real solution. (“Will storing CO2 in old oil fields slow global warming? First California plan nears approval,” Jan. 14)

The process in question requires vast amounts of energy and water. The presence of oil wells and pipelines can result in dangerous and potentially deadly leaks. That’s especially true of improperly plugged wells in the oilfields that companies like California Resources Corp. want to use as carbon dumping grounds.

Carbon capture and storage projects divert funds away from what is truly needed: a just transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as wind and rooftop solar.

Rather than marking “a drastic transformation for fossil fuel companies” and communities, as oil industry supporters claim, carbon management is nothing more than corporate greenwashing intended to keep these polluting companies in business.

To the editor: Let me see if I understand this correctly.

California Resources Corp. wants to utilize its depleted oil fields to store carbon emissions deep underground. This company polluted California for decades, for profit, and now it wants to utilize the same ground that is basically a wasteland of little to no value to store carbon emissions that resulted from the extraction of its product in the first place.

The company made unbelievable amounts of money extracting fossil fuels that have resulted in the loss of many lives through their detrimental effects on the environment. Now, it wants to be part of the solution by profiting from the removal of the very same environmental toxins.

I think California Resources Corp. could pay for this sequestration itself in an attempt to mitigate the horrid effects it’s had on the human population over the decades. But then again, there would be no profit in that.

 Russia – Exposure of ‘dirty bomb’ plans caused panic in Kiev

“Many signs” show Ukraine is winding down its program amid Moscow’s revelations, a senior diplomat claimed

Kiev might be shelving its alleged ‘dirty bomb’ program after Russia exposed it, Moscow’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, claimed on Tuesday. He added that Ukraine may well have time to do this before the upcoming nuclear inspection.

Over the last few days, Russian officials, including Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, have been accusing Kiev of preparing a false-flag attack with the use of a ‘dirty bomb’, a device combining conventional explosives with radioactive material. Ukraine has categorically denied Moscow’s claims.

“If you read the Ukrainian Telegram channels, you would see that there is a lot of fuss in the Ukrainian ruling circles now because of the campaign that we have started to launch, and there are many signs that they are trying to sort of wind down this program,” Polyansky said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.

In his opinion, Ukraine has enough time to scale back the ‘dirty bomb’ plans before the upcoming visit of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors.

“They can come, but I am telling you that a ‘dirty bomb’ is not a very complex device,”Polyansky explained, adding that there is no guarantee that Kiev will not resume its alleged activity after the inspectors depart.

At the same time, the official claimed that the danger of Kiev using a ‘dirty bomb’ remains “very high,” and that Ukraine “has the opportunity” and “has every reason to use it.”

Earlier on Tuesday, in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Russian mission’s head, Vassily Nebenzia, said that Moscow would consider the use of a ‘dirty bomb’ by Ukraine “an act of nuclear terrorism.”

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba earlier called the Russian allegations “as absurd as they are dangerous.” He also noted that “Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves.”

On Tuesday, the minister revealed that Ukraine had invited IAEA inspectors to come and to “prove that Ukraine has neither any dirty bombs nor plans to develop them.”

“Good cooperation with IAEA and partners allows us to foil Russia’s ‘dirty bomb’ disinfo campaign,” Kuleba said.

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, commenting on the matter, said that “all parties should avoid any actions that could lead to miscalculation and escalation of what’s already a devastating conflict.”

Meanwhile, the Pentagon claimed that Russia’s allegations against Ukraine were “transparently false.” NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said that the allies “reject the allegation” and believe that Russia “must not use it as a pretext” for further escalation.

 ISLAMABAD - Ambassador of Denmark, Jakob Linulf has said that carbon markets are a new opportunity for Pakistan to improve its economic situation and reduce carbon emissions for a green development through sustainable and environment friendly practices.

Climate change was casting adverse impacts on the globe and it was equally important for Pakistan and Denmark to develop strategies for averting its risks to humanity and biodiversity, said Ambassador Jakob Linulf while addressing to the one-day capacity building workshop for journalists on Climate-Smart Reporting: Carbon Market and Equitable Development jointly organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and the Embassy of Denmark here Thursday.

He said Denmark had completed its green transition and transformed its energy sector from a fossil fuel-dependent energy mix to a greener one based on solar, wind, and biomass. “Denmark has faced a lot of challenges in the way and that’s why it wants to share its lessons learnt with Pakistan so that it do not repeat the same mistakes,” he said. The Danish ambassador noted that the Danish companies had adequate technologies to address climate change impacts which can collaborate with their Pakistani counterparts.

“Pakistan is facing double crises; economic crisis coupled with climate change as the 2022 floods inundated one third of the country leaving millions of millions displaced and billions of dollars livestock, infrastructure and ready to harvest crops washed away,” he said. He highlighted that carbon market can be an important tool in developing right and efficient tools to benefit from latest mechanisms to cut carbon emission and address climate change but it should be considered as a financial facility alone. He said the business leaders can take the lead to influence green transition especially in the sectors of steel, fertiliser, and cement where carbon adjustment can be one tool alongwith fuel adjustment and waste management. Soren Lutken, Chief Carbon Market Special UNEP Copenhagen said carbon markets is not the only solution to climate crisis as it was not exactly the idea to reduce but shift the emissions from one place to the other.

He said Pakistan is the host of the cheaper emissions reduction mechanism whereas it was imperative to break the myth that it has missed the train to address Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). He said the country needed to come up with a clear policy framework to decide its moment to enter the compliance carbon markets. “There are cooperations available globally that are interested to buy carbon credits that needs to be explored efficiently with clear policy direction and leadership,” he said. Nadeem Nawaz, Special Advisor and Country Manager at Danish Energy Agency and Global Cooperation provided a brief presentation on the long-term energy planning strategies of Pakistan towards 2050.

He said Pakistan needs to be chalk out a credible roadmap that will lead to tempt more investors in the realm of carbon credits’ training. In his opening remarks, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director, SDPI said journalists can shape public opinion and guide policymakers on adopting efficient carbon markets, whereas the think-tank and media both can benefit from each other’s experiences to reduce carbon emissions. “It is important to highlight the urgency of climate change and the critical nature of the transformative power of carbon markets as South Asia is suffering from many environmental crises,” he said.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Waste recovery is necessary to reduce the increasing quantity of landfill and other forms of rubbish dumping.

Garbage can be transformed into fuel, wood, compost and other materials. Doing this can help to cut contamination, greenhouse gas emissions and landfill use.

The Ljubljana Regional Waste Management Centre (RCERO Ljubljana) is the biggest environmental project in Slovenia, and the most modern facility for waste treatment in Europe.

It is also Slovenia’s biggest cohesion fund environmental project, and a great example of regional cooperation.

Euronews’ Aurora Velez spoke with RCERO Ljubljana’s Founder and Head of Investments and Development, Mjtja Praznik, who created, designed and founded the centre from scratch.

Euronews: How did you come up with the idea for the project?

Mjtja Praznik: Some of the activities started in 2000 when Slovenia was joining the EU: we had to adopt a lot of legislative changes in the field of waste management. Up to that time, most of the municipal waste was thrown into landfill. And this, according to new legislation, needed to stop.

So we thought we needed to treat waste: first, separate it, and then use it for material recycling and energy recovery.

Euronews: What is - according to you- the impact of the project in Slovenia and in Europe?

Mjtja Praznik: Slovenia was treating its municipal waste mainly by landfill, losing all the materials and all the energy. By changing the principle, and by introducing this new treatment for waste, the rate of material being recycled has considerably improved.

We have also replaced some combustibles and energies from the fuel produced in the waste and, last but not least, we have also significantly reduced the amount of waste that is going into landfill. From the new plant, only 2% of the waste goes there: the other 98% is transformed into fuel!

Euronews: How do you feel about having created the project from scratch?

Mjtja Praznik: I am very proud of this project. I had the idea 20 years ago and had started researching the technology then.

I am happy that we were able to use our previous experience from landfill, gas extraction and utilisation. All this knowledge has been key to the project. We have aerobic treatment, anaerobic treatment, mechanical treatment: these are all my babies!

I started with it, and I went through all these phases: preparing, studying, comparing different technologies. And lastly, opting for the finance from the European Commission, because the project was not cheap!

Then it took around three and a half years to get the project ready for operation. I'm happy that it was a long project because it is a big one that can't be done overnight.

 RAMSTEIN AIR BASE - Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised Tuesday that the United States will not let Ukraine fail in fighting off Russia, even as further aid remains stalled in Congress and Kyiv’s forces face shortages of munitions.

The Republican-led House of Representatives has been blocking $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine and the United States has warned that a recent $300 million package would only last a few weeks.

The “United States will not let Ukraine fail”, Austin said at the opening of a meeting in Germany of Ukraine’s international supporters, at which he is seeking to secure further assistance for Kyiv.

“We remain determined to provide Ukraine with the resources that it needs to resist the Kremlin’s aggression,” he said. Washington announced $300 million in assistance for Ukraine last week, but Austin said it was only possible due to savings on recent purchases.

“We were only able to support this much-needed package by identifying some unanticipated contract savings”, Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement the day before that it is “critically important for us that the Congress soon completes all the necessary procedures and makes a final decision” on aid for Kyiv.

Top US military officer General Charles “CQ” Brown told journalists en route to the Ukraine meeting that Kyiv’s troops are “having to pay attention to their supply rates and how they execute.” There is an “incremental kind of back and forth between Ukraine and Russia”, with “incremental gains on both sides”, Brown said.

But he noted that “even as the Russians have gained territory, they do it at a pretty big cost in number of casualties, like in personnel, but also in number of pieces of equipment that are being taken out.”

Austin said in his remarks Tuesday that “Russia has paid a staggering cost for (President Vladimir) Putin’s imperial dreams”, using “up to $211 billion to equip, deploy, maintain, and sustain its imperial aggression against Ukraine.”

“At least 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded” since Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Austin said, adding that Ukraine has also “sunk, destroyed, or damaged some 20 medium-to-large Russian navy vessels.”

The sinkings have been an embarrassment for Moscow and Russian state media confirmed Tuesday that the country had replaced the head of its navy. Austin and other US officials have spearheaded the push for international support for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia invaded and coordinating aid from dozens of countries.

Speaking at the Ramstein US base, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Berlin has offered another half a million euros worth of military aid to Ukraine. “That includes 10,000 rounds of ammunition from the stock of our armed forces,” he told journalists. Germany is Ukraine’s second biggest donor of military support, after Washington, which has committed tens of billions of dollars to aid Kyiv since February 2022.",1,"['URW: Overpraising the West', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Australian Open bans flags from Russia and Belarus on site

Flags from Russia and Belarus were banned from the site of the Australian Open on Tuesday after more than one was brought into the stands by spectators on the first day of the Grand Slam tournament.

Normally, flags can be displayed during matches at Melbourne Park. But Tennis Australia suspended that policy for the two countries involved in the invasion of Ukraine that began nearly a year ago.

“Our initial policy was that fans could bring [flags] in but could not use them to cause disruption,” Tennis Australia said in a statement Tuesday. “Yesterday we had an incident where a flag was placed courtside. We will continue to work with the players and our fans to ensure that this is the best possible environment to enjoy the tennis.”

One Russian flag was displayed during Ukrainian player Kateryna Baindl’s 7-5, 6-7 (8), 6-1 victory over Russian player Kamilla Rakhimova on Court 14 in the first round Monday.

Another was offered to Russian player Daniil Medvedev to autograph after his 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 win over Marcos Giron in Rod Laver Arena on Monday night.

Asked about the new flag ban, Belarusian player Aryna Sabalenka said after her first-round victory Tuesday that she would prefer that politics and sports remain separate but that she understands the decision by Tennis Australia.

Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff each pick up wins in the first round of the Australian Open as they begin their quest for a first Grand Slam title.

“I mean, if everyone feels better this way, then it’s OK,” said Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam semifinalist who is seeded No. 5 at Melbourne Park. “I have zero control on it. What can I say? They did it. OK. No flags? No flags.”

Sabalenka was among the athletes from Russia and Belarus who were barred last year from competing at Wimbledon and team events such as the Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup because of the war in Ukraine. Russia invaded, with help from Belarus, in February.

Russian and Belarusian players have been allowed to enter the other three Grand Slam tournaments but as “neutral” athletes, so their nationalities are not acknowledged on any official schedules or results for the event and their countries’ flags are not displayed on TV graphics.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dawn Sturgess Inquiry chaired by Lord Anthony Hughes (lead image left). “The war in Ukraine has required”, McGahey (right), a barrister representing the government ministries, wrote to Hughes, “and continues to require work to be undertaken by many of the same individuals and resources who are working on disclosures. Many of those working disclosure are subject matter experts,. While disclosure to the Inquiry is a priority, there have been times when this has had to take second place behind live, ongoing issues of national security.”

McGahey testifed before Hughes at a two-hour hearing on the Novichok allegations in a London courtroom last Friday, November 11. Follow what was said, and what was meant, in this analysis. An official transcript of the hearing can be read here.

According to McGahey, “approximately 80,000 documents (including emails) have been identified and located as relevant” to the Hughes inquiry. But before any of them can be identified, quoted, or released publicly, McGahey suggested, the government’s Ukraine warfighters will be obliged to down their weapons and pick up censorship tools to prevent the Russians from gaining any advantage.

As Hughes has announced, referring to the allegations of Novichok poisoning, “the responsibility for the events in Salisbury [Skripal incident March 4, 2018] and Amesbury [Sturgess incident June 30, 2018] is what is to be decided by this Inquiry. There is, however, at least a prima facie case (denied by those accused) that those responsible were Russian nationals acting in the interests of the Russian state and allegedly under its direction.”

Exactly what roles in the Ukraine war the “subject matter experts” are playing has not been disclosed. The Russian Government has publicly accused the British Government of providing undersea drone and other technology for attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, Russia’s Black Sea fleet, a plan of attack against the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, and nuclear weapons design.

McGahey told Hughes the British Government hasn’t enough money to pay these warfighters to do both the Ukrainian and the Novichok jobs. “There are stretched resources and budgets across HMG [HHis Majesty’s Government], which are not trivial, and there is very real pressure on government departments and agencies.”

Hughes has decided there must be a near-total ban on identifying by name any British official engaged in warmaking against Russia, including intelligence gathering, weapons training, plans and operations.

“The risk of damage to national security here,” he said, ” lies in the risk that hostile actors, whether State or otherwise and, if State, whether Russian or otherwise, might target individuals identified as concerned in the UK reaction to those events, and/or might use access to their names as a means of disrupting UK public functions. I am satisfied, on all the material I have seen, both OPEN and CLOSED, that these are marked real risks to some of those who were involved in the 2018 events, and that Russia in particular has both an interest in such activity and a known capacity to carry it out. For most of these persons therefore, a restriction order is likely to be necessary… [Russia] would have a similar interest in anyone amongst government staff who carried out any sensitive role; an obvious example would be any person concerned in the work of intelligence agencies, or other covert activities, but the risk will not be limited to them. General disclosure of the names of persons subject to these risks would indeed present a hostile actor with a convenient directory of suitable targets and/or a list of sensitive functions which would be of considerable value to a hostile actor accumulating intelligence about UK security and government systems.”

 ""Aren't They Fools?"": Putin Says Ukrainian Statehood Risks 'Irreparable Blow' If War Continues

Russian President Vladimir Putin gave statements on Tuesday which assessed the overall status of the nearly two-year conflict with Ukraine at a moment Western and world leaders meet in Davos for the World Economic Forum (WEF). Zelensky while there in Switzerland pressed Ukraine's case for the need to achieve air superiority.

But Putin in his fresh remarks stressed that not only do Russian forces have the clear upper hand, but he emphasized for the first time that Ukrainian statehood itself risks an ""irreparable"" blow if the war continues. He stressed that Ukraine's military has already ""failed"".

""Not only has their counteroffensive failed, but the initiative is entirely in the hands of the Russian Armed Forces,"" Putin said in the televised remarks. ""If this continues, Ukraine's statehood could be dealt an irreparable, very serious blow,"" he added, but he didn't clarify further precisely what he meant by this.

""They are trying to show that they can also do something. But instead of solving military tasks, they act in such a barbaric way. Attacks are being carried out on peaceful settlements with indiscriminate weapons,"" Putin said in reference to the past several weeks of cross-border attacks on Belgorod city, which have killed and maimed Russian civilians.

Putin further addressed Zelensky's efforts to gather world leaders for a peace summit hosted by Switzerland, to consider Kiev's 10-point peace plan, which it should be noted rejects the possibility of territorial concessions.

""The so-called 'peace formula' that's being talked about in the West and in Ukraine is a continuation of the decree of the Ukrainian president banning negotiations with Russia,"" Putin said, according to a translation in Sputnik.

""As for the negotiating process, it's an attempt to encourage us to abandon the territorial gains we've achieved over the past 1 1/2 years. But this is impossible. Everyone understands that this is impossible,"" the Russian leader continued.

He explained that earlier in the conflict, the two sides were close to serious negotiations that could have led to peace, but that ultimately Zelensky allowed himself to be the puppet of Western powers...

""A day later, they threw all the agreements into the trash, and now they are saying publicly—including the head of the Ukrainian negotiating group—that 'Yes, we were ready, but we missed the chance, because then-Prime Minister of Britain Mr. [Boris] Johnson came and persuaded us not to implement these agreements,'"" Putin said.

He stressed: ""Fools, are they not? They're admitting directly that if they had gone for it, everything could have been ended a long time ago, 1 1/2 years ago.""

Lately, Ukraine has been seeking to get China involved in getting on board with its peace formula. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak on Sunday said, ""China needs to be involved in talks to end the war with Russia."" He issued the words just ahead of the WEF. China remains the most influential Global South country widely viewed as squarely in Russia's corner, having refused to rebuke Moscow or join Western-led sanctions after two years of the conflict. Kiev hopes to get Global South countries on its side, thus further isolating Moscow - but so far this has proved somewhat futile.",1,"['URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:

The world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.

These “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

There has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”

Last year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.

China is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.

Ukraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.

On October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.

As Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?

To further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.

To retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.

As the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.”

It is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, “What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.”

Biden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.

Not content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.

As the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.

176,EN_CC_100139.txt,"Anglican archbishop lauds Pakistani church's efforts for climate action, interfaith harmony 

 The Archbishop of Canterbury’s Special Representative to the Holy See and Director of the Anglican Centre in Rome, Archbishop Ian Ernest has lauded the Church of Pakistan’s efforts to promote interfaith relations in the country as well as initiating action on the environmental challenges in line with the Lambeth Calls for climate action.

Archbishop Ernest arrived in Pakistan on February 2 on a three-day on the invitation of Church of Pakistan’s President Bishop Dr Azad Marshall. During the visit, the senior church leader held various interactions with faith leaders and community members. He also visited Jaranwala to express solidarity with the victims of the August 16, 2023, violent attacks on multiple churches and homes of Christians.

Speaking to a gathering of interfaith leaders at the Saint Peter’s High School of the Diocese of Raiwand, Archbishop Ernest noted the cordial relations between the clergy of the majority Muslim community and leaders of other faiths. He stressed on the need for continued engagement between the various faith groups for promoting harmony and peaceful coexistence in society.

“It’s encouraging to see such good interfaith relations, which can also contribute greatly towards our common goal of protecting our environment,” said Archbishop Ernest.

The visiting dignitary was awarded a shield by Muslim faith leaders, including former special assistant to the prime minister on interfaith harmony Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi.

The archbishop also participated in a special meeting on climate action organised by the moderator bishop of the Church of Pakistan on Feb 4.

Addressing the participants, Archbishop Ernest lauded the Church of Pakistan’s initiative on climate action, saying he was impressed by the realisation in the church for collaborating with ecumenical partners and faith-based institutions to bring about the much-needed change by raising awareness and collective action.

“I think it’s a God given opportunity for us to be able to change the mentality of our people and to bring about the values of the Kingdom where respect for God’s creation and respect for the other are of crucial importance. Without respecting what God has given us so freely, it would be difficult for us to be instruments of grace in the world,” he said.

Earlier, Bishop Marshall briefed the meeting about the church’s initiatives for fostering partnerships to meet the environmental challenges.

He stressed on inculcating the spirit of stewardship, as embodied by the wisdom of the Christian tradition, to change the mindset towards the natural world.

“Though Pakistan is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, it is unfortunate that our country is also the least funded to effectively combat the crisis.

“We need to act together to protect, restore and safeguard the environment for ourselves and for our future generations,” he emphasised.

Archbishop Ernest and bishops of all dioceses of the Church of Pakistan also participated in the soft-launch of Bishop Marshall’s book titled “The Calling of Lent” at the Lahore College of Theology.

The messages of Archbishop of Canterbury Rt Revd Justin Welby and Anglican Communion’s Secretary General Rt Revd Bishop Anthony Poggo were also shared on the occasion.

In his message, Archbishop Welby said, “Archbishop Azad has taken considerable care to explore some of the spiritual disciplines which might help people journey more closely with Christ to the Cross and prepare for the celebrations of Easter.”

Bishop Poggo, who has written the foreword of the book, stated: “As you study this book during Lent, do please reflect upon the passion of Jesus. Lent is also a season whereby we acknowledge our need for repentance, mercy and forgiveness which is the essence of the message of Jesus Christ’s suffering on the cross.”",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 German bosses, unions jointly oppose boycott of Russian gas

Germany’s employers and unions have joined together in opposing an immediate European Union ban on natural gas imports from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, saying such a move would lead to factory shutdowns and the loss of jobs in the bloc’s largest economy.

“A rapid gas embargo would lead to loss of production, shutdowns, a further de-industrialization and the long-term loss of work positions in Germany,” said Rainer Dulger, chairman of the BDA employer’s group, and Reiner Hoffmann, chairman of the DGB trade union confederation, in a joint statement Monday on Germany’s dpa news agency.

The statement comes as European leaders are discussing possible new energy sanctions against Russian oil, following a decision April 7 to ban Russian coal imports beginning in August. Ukraine’s leaders say revenues from Russia’s energy exports are financing Moscow’s destructive war on Ukraine and must be ended.

That won’t be easy to do. The EU’s 27 nations get around 40% of their natural gas from Russia and around 25% of their oil. Natural gas would be the most difficult do without, energy analysts say, since most of it comes by pipeline from Russia and supplies of liquefied gas, which can be ordered by ship, are limited amid strong demand worldwide.

Germany, a major manufacturing hub and an importer of Russian gas, has so far resisted an immediate shut-off and said it plans to instead phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and most Russian gas imports by mid-2024. The EU’s executive commission has outlined steps to cut the consumption of Russian gas by two-thirds by year’s end through using more pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, importing more liqueifed gas, accelerating the deployment of wind and solar projects and intensifying conservation efforts.

German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said in an interview with the Funke media group that “an immediate gas embargo would endanger social peace in Germany.”

Despite widespread economic sanctions against Russian banks and individuals, the EU continues to send around $850 million a day to Russia for oil and gas, even as EU governments condemn the war in Ukraine. Gas-intensive companies include producers of glass, metals, ceramics and chemicals. Industry officials say in many cases natural gas would be impossible to replace in the short run.

Analysts say Russian crude oil would be easier to replace than gas but that a boycott would still lead to higher energy prices that would hit consumers who are already facing record EU inflation of 7.5%.",1,['URW: Negative Consequences for the West'],['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
178,EN_CC_200022.txt,"Denmark to Punish Farmers for Cow ‘Emissions’ to ‘Fight Global Warming’ 

 by Frank Bergman, Slay News:

The Danish government has introduced radical new laws that will tax livestock farmers for “emissions” from cows, pigs, and sheep to supposedly “fight global warming.”

Demark has become the first country in the world to introduce a carbon tax that seeks to force farmers to comply with the goals of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) “Net Zero” agenda.

The Scandinavian nation will tax farmers for the so-called “greenhouse gases” allegedly emitted by their livestock from 2030.


Denmark’s globalist leaders claim they are targeting a major source of methane emissions, which they allege is one of the most potent gases contributing to “global warming.”

In order to comply with the WEF’s “Net Zero” targets, Taxation Minister Jeppe Bruus said the aim is to reduce Danish “greenhouse gas emissions” by 70% from 1990 levels by 2030.

As of 2030, Danish livestock farmers will be taxed $43 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030.

The tax will increase to $108 by 2035.

However, because of an income tax deduction of 60%, the actual cost per ton will start at $17.3 and increase to $28 by 2035.

Although carbon dioxide is typically blamed for causing “climate change,” globalists claim that methane traps about 87 times more heat on a 20-year timescale.

However, as Slay News has previously reported, top scientists have debunked these claims as a hoax.

A recent peer-reviewed study provided conclusive scientific evidence proving that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Earth’s atmosphere cannot cause “global warming.”

Dr. Jan Kubicki led a group of world-renowned Polish scientists to study the impact of increases in CO2 emissions on the Earth’s global temperatures.

However, not only did they find that higher levels of CO2 made no difference, but they also proved that it simply isn’t possible for increases in carbon dioxide to cause temperatures to rise.

Kubicki and his team recently published three papers which all conclude that Earth’s atmosphere is already “saturated” with carbon dioxide.

This saturation means that, even at greatly increased levels of CO2, the “greenhouse gas” will not cause temperatures to rise.

Nevertheless, unelected globalists at the United Nations Environment Program claim that livestock accounts for about 32% of “human-caused methane emissions.”

“We will take a big step closer in becoming climate neutral in 2045,” Bruus said.",1,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Methodologies/metrics used are unreliable/faulty', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Greenhouse effect/carbon dioxide do not drive climate change', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities']",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Zelensky Exposed: Former Advisor Reveals How Ukrainian President Thinks He's Omnipotent

Authored by Grzegorz Adamczyk via Remix News,

The arrogance of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is causing problems with Kyiv’s allies and he believes that, as his country is at war, he can do anything, his former adviser has claimed.

In a bombshell interview with Polish news outlet dorzeczy.pl, Oleksyi Arestovych slammed his former boss for his increasingly overbearing behavior and believes he has fallen victim to delusions of grandeur and a belief that he is all-powerful.

Arestovych cited Zelensky’s response to the ongoing diplomatic conflict over the dumping of Ukrainian grain as an example, accusing the president’s office of “behaving as if it has a decisive voice in the European Union rather than being a country aspiring to join the bloc.”

The former adviser, who himself is a possible candidate in any future Ukrainian presidential election, expressed his fear that Zelensky “has become deluded into thinking he now rules the globe.”

His diplomacy concentrates on making demands and using moral blackmail to claim Ukraine is fighting for the West, said Arestovych, who claimed this tactic may have been successful at the beginning of the conflict but is no longer effective.

“The West is increasingly irritated by Ukraine’s arrogance,” he added.

Arestovych claimed that Zelensky’s behavior had led to tension among Kyiv’s closest allies including Poland and Romania, while its relations with the U.S. and the U.K. have also cooled.

The West will continue to support Ukraine because it is in the West’s own interests to do so, but it may well stop supporting the current Ukrainian government and back an alternative, he warned.

However, Arestovych was dismissive of the argument that Ukraine was colluding with Germany against Poland, claiming that this is only purely due to the fact that Ukraine has no clear foreign policy under Zelensky.

Ukraine wants Germany to be a counter-balance to Russia and that is why Ukraine backs its ambitions of securing a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, the former advisor told the Polish news outlet.

Arestovych admitted that Poland could have gotten more out of Ukraine on issues related to the Volhynia massacre by pursuing a more transactional policy towards the country, but that would not have been beneficial to it in the longer term. “Even if Zelensky is ungrateful for all the help selflessly offered by Poland, Ukrainian people are grateful and that will be more important in the longer term,” he assured.

 LAHORE - Bahria Town, under the visionary leadership of Malik Riaz Hussain, ismaking Pakistan proud by receiving global recognition for its impactful social welfare endeavors. Highlighted in a recent report by The World Financial Review. “Malik Riaz, Asia’s largest real estate developer, has set an example that might inspire other Pakistani entrepreneurs to step forward and address the needs of an increasingly low-income population” says the report.

Malik Riaz and Bahria Town’s commitment to addressing hunger and poverty in Pakistan through initiatives like Bahria Dastarkhwan has garnered significant praise. Some globally well-known newspapers i.e. News Week, CNN, Los Angeles Times, EuroAsia Industry and The National already have recognized Malik Riaz Hussain and Bahria Town’s social welfare initiatives. The article statEs that in a country where economic challenges persist and government resources are stretched thin, Bahria Town has stepped up to fill critical gaps in social welfare. From providing free meals to hundreds of thousands through Bahria Dastarkhwan to mobilizing rescue teams during natural disasters, Bahria Town’s efforts have touched the lives of millions.

Furthermore, the article reads as Malik Riaz’s belief in mutual prosperity drives such philanthropic initiatives, aimed at improving the lives of ordinary Pakistanis. While recognizing the limitations of private initiatives, Bahria Town remain hopeful for increased government support to amplify its impact further. Moreover, the report asserts that as climate change exacerbates challenges in Pakistan, Bahria Town remains steadfast in its commitment to serving communities in need. Bahria Town’s relief operations during the 2022 floods underscore its dedication to humanitarian causes. The global acknowledgment of Bahria Town and Malik Riaz’s efforts underscores the pivotal role of the private sector in addressing societal challenges.

This type of bilateral cooperation has set a good example for the EU by adhering to the principle of mutual benefit and addressing differences through dialogue and consultation, experts said.

On Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian announced that Séjourné will pay a visit to China on Monday at the invitation of Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi.

During Séjourné's visit, the two countries are expected to focus on bilateral economic and trade relations, solving problems encountered in cooperation, and creating a better business environment for enterprises of both sides, Cong Yi, a professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Sunday.

In addition, they may strengthen communication and cooperation in international affairs and jointly address global challenges such as climate change and public health, Cong noted.

This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. France will be the guest country of honor at the China International Fair for Trade in Services 2024 and the seventh China International Import Expo.

Over the past six decades, the two countries have adhered to mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, with economic and trade cooperation becoming increasingly closer, experts noted.

""China and France eye faster growth in traditional areas including agricultural products, aviation and civilian nuclear power,"" Cong said.

Under the mechanism ""from French farms to Chinese tables,"" the two countries have reaped fruitful achievements in agricultural products.

As an important source of China's agricultural and food imports, France is China's top agricultural import market and second-largest agricultural trading partner in the EU.

For many years, France has been the largest supplier of bottled still and sparkling wines to China. According to the China Association for Imports and Export of Wines and Spirits, China's wine imports in 2022 amounted to about $1.43 billion, with an import volume of 335,300 kiloliters, of which three countries - France, Chile and Italy - accounted for nearly 80 percent.

In 2022, France's wine exports to China totaled $661.9 million.

In addition, France was the first Western country to sign an air transportation agreement with China and the first Western country to cooperate with China in civilian nuclear energy, according to new.china.com.

""The digital economy will become an important area of economic and trade cooperation between China and France. The two sides can launch in-depth collaboration in artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and other fields,"" Cong said.

The two countries also have extensive room for cooperation in the field of clean energy, and they can jointly develop and promote new-energy technologies to help transform the global energy structure, he noted.

Moreover, cooperation between China and France in the fields of the economy, trade, science and technology has demonstrated the broad prospects and great potential of China-EU cooperation, which has helped to enhance the confidence of both sides in cooperation between China and Europe, Cong said.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 VLADIMIR Putin was spotted with a mystery ""prominent scar"" on his neck that has led to swirling rumours the despot is amid a ""thyroid cancer battle"".

Intrigue over the Russian leader's health resurfaced following photos that were snapped at an Orthodox Easter cathedral service in Moscow at the weekend.

Images showed stone-faced Putin clasping a candle as the church proceedings went on.

However, most strikingly was an evident ""scar"" on his neck.

It prompted a debate online about whether the new snaps stack up the claims made by Proekt media, who have said Putin is suffering from thyroid cancer.

The independent outlet spearheaded an investigation that revealed the dictator was constantly accompanied by a team of surgeons.

One in particular, Yevgeny Selivanov, who specialises in thyroid cancer.

The scar appears as a prominent diagonal line upwards from left to right on his neck.

It was clearly seen in the pictures posted by the Kremlin from the Easter service.

Telegram channel, Unian, claimed the scar was the shape of a letter 'Z', a pro-war symbol used by Putin’s invading forces.

Most read in The Sun

An Unian spokesman said: ""A strange scar in the shape of the letter 'Z' has been noticed on Putin's neck.

""The unusual shots were taken on Easter when the dictator visited a cathedral.""

Denis Kazaksky, a Ukrainian blogger, also pointed to the ""prominent scar"" in one of his social media videos.

He said: ""What is it with Volodya [Putin]?

""I think I have figured out where the 'Z' came from.""

It is not the first time Putin's apparent scar has come to light.

In December 2020, Russian media outlet Sobesednik identified a distinct marking on his neck.

At the time, plastic surgeon Amjad Al-Yousef said: ""In theory, after intubation such a scar can remain, but this is only in theory.

""It often happens that not even a scar remains as the skin heals.""

He was speaking before suspicious claims emerged that Putin suffered from thyroid cancer.

However, there is no evidence the despot leader has ever undergone surgery for removal of the thyroid gland.

Al-Yousef claimed it could possibly not be a scar but a mark in his loose skin - common in an ""elderly person"".

Conversely in 2020, the marking did not appear as prominent as seen in recent days at the Christ the Saviour Cathedral in Moscow.

Al-Yousef suggested Putin, 70, had undergone regular plastic surgery on his face - but this was not done on his neck.

He said: ""No plastic surgery is performed on this part of the body.

""Even if we assume that this is some kind of innovation in plastic surgery, then in this case it would have been performed more professionally without such a serious mistake.""

Pointing to a photo of Putin from 2020, Al-Yousef clarified the differences in appearance.

He said: ""Here is the classic neck of a 68 year old man with low skin strength.

“With age, skin turgor changes and becomes weaker.

""Vladimir Putin’s face is very well-groomed, professional cosmetic care is noticeable.

""And when we see the perfect face, we naturally begin to pay attention to the skin of the neck.

""Unfortunately, there are no such effective professional treatments for the neck.

""While putting a shirt and a tie on, the throat is squeezed, the skin gathers and turns into such a fold.""

The Proekt investigative report claimed one medic Alexey Shcheglov ""relentlessly"" followed the Russian leader and had made 59 trips encompassing 282 days by his side.

According to the report, Shcheglov was seen as a medic ""who, among other things, can be the first to detect problems with the thyroid gland, including oncological ones.""

Putin was also under the attention of Igor Esakov, an ENT specialist, who made 38 trips to Putin, covering 152 days.

He was also accompanied by Yevgeny Selivanov, a cancer surgeon - during 35 trips, it was reported.

His expertise covers ""peculiarities of diagnostics and surgical treatment of elderly and senile patients with thyroid cancer.""

Multiple other medics were revealed as caring for the Russian president.

Separate claims have suggested Putin was undergoing chemotherapy.

One political analyst claimed the warmonger was ""high on speed"" to get through key meetings as he struggles with health issues.

 by Tom Luongo, Tom Luongo:

“The Vorlons say, understanding is a three-edged sword: your side, their side, and the truth”

— John Sheridan, Babylon 5

The biggest media story of 2024 so far has come and gone. Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin last week.

Everyone, even the Davos/UK dominated media, has put forth their opinion on it. I gave out a quick take for my Patrons the morning after just like everyone else. And like everyone else I missed the biggest takeaway from this interview.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Now, if you go through the commentary what you will mostly see is people, as always, doing what traders call “talking their book.” In other words, as opposed to dealing with the information presented and the motivations of the people involved, most media outlets and commentators put forth their opinion on whether this interview satisfied their needs from it.

So, for the hardcore geopolitical types and armchair psychoanalysts, we heard a lot of opinions second-guessing Putin’s strategy to open the interview with a nearly thirty minute recitation of Russian/Ukrainian history. Why would he do this, was the common refrain.

I’ll use my former-bellwether-for-normies, Scott Adams, as an example of this.

How many of you thought Putin was “all there” in the Tucker interview?

If he seemed lucid to you, it’s because Biden is your comparison.

I thought Putin seemed unhinged. The history lesson was not a good sign. https://t.co/VZiEIHRZ2t

— Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) February 9, 2024

This was the kindest of the ‘bad takes’ I found on this. But I’m having one of Scott’s “One movie, two screens,” moments here. Because Putin looked anything other than “unhinged.” In fact, he looked as calm as I’ve ever seen him, taking a relaxed posture to put Carlson, who was clearly unsure of where he stood at the beginning of the interview, at ease.

But this is the message that Adams wanted to see, framing Putin in relation to Biden, because he needed something unique to say to justify his even being in the conversation.

By contrast, Martin Armstrong had a great post curating all of the crazy Neocon takes from the “media” on his blog over the weekend.

What’s obvious from those is that they understood that Putin’s 30 minute opening monologue would put off a lot of casual watchers who would tune him out at that point. So, their “analysis” focused on steering the conversation to Putin’s ‘false history’ of Russia and Ukraine.

This way that ‘false history’ would dominate everyone’s opinions the next day, managing the Overton Window of the entire interview, making it all about that. This would be the basis of how they discredit Putin.

Then to discredit Carlson, people like Hillary Clinton was trotted out to lie about Tucker Carlson, calling him a “useful idiot,” and “puppy dog” and a joke in Russian media, which is an outright lie. Hillary’s harpy laugh made an appearance alongside a sycophant interviewer as they joked about Carlson’s having been fired from every legitimate news agency.

We were treated to a common sight: Two Beltway insiders laughing inside their echo chamber and only our sick fascination with roadkill makes it even remotely interesting.

So, the whole exercise is reframed as Puppy Dog Tucker throwing softballs to Liar Putin to distract us away from the sum and substance of their talk.

 The Ukraine War, How the British Derailed Peace

BATTLEFORWORLD.COM | November 25, 2023: Ex-Pentagon analyst revealed that the West refused to support the Ukraine-Russia peace talks and is now seeking a way out.

The leader of the Servant of the People faction in the Ukrainian parliament, Davyd Arakhamia, disclosed that the March 2022 Russian-Ukrainian peace talks was a no go because then UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson brought the negotiations to zero, to have Ukraine continue the conflict. And to pressure the Kiev regime, that was when the “Bucha massacre” appeared at the appropriate time to derailed the peace talks that was ongoing in Turkey.

The Bucha massacre was later debunked by Russia as a hoax, but the damage was already done to smear Russia on the world stage, to which the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson continued along pushing the war stroking the conflict as various countries kept on supplying all sorts of weapons.

According to Arakhamia, the Russians were willing to end the conflict if Ukraine was to agree to neutrality and provide guarantees to not join NATO. Arakhamia referenced an interview he gave to Ukrainian TV channel 1+1, saying: “When we returned from Istanbul, Boris Johnson came to Kiev and said: ‘We won’t sign anything with them at all, and let’s just fight’.”

 Russia will win the special operation in Ukraine if the society shows consolidation and composure to the enemy, President Vladimir Putin said during a visit to the Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant on March 14, Rossiya 24 TV channel said.

Russia is not improving its geopolitical position in Ukraine. Instead, Russia is fighting ""for the survival of Russian statehood, for the future development of the country and our children.""

""In order to bring peace and stability closer, we, of course, need to show the consolidation and composure of our society. When the enemy sees that our society is strong, internally braced up, consolidated, then, without any doubt we will come to reach what we are striving for — both success and victory,"" Putin said.

According to him, many of the current problems began after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when they tried to put pressure on Russia to ""destabilise the internal political situation.” ""Hordes of international terrorists"" new sent to the purpose to accomplish this goal, Putin said.

Afterwards, the West decided to start rehabilitating Nazism in Russia's neighbouring states, including in Ukraine.

Nevertheless, Putin continued, Russia had long tried to build partnerships with both Western countries and Ukraine. However, after 2014, when the West contributed to the coup in Ukraine, the state of affairs changed dramatically. It was then when they started exterminating those who advocated the development of normal relations with Russia, he said.

According to Putin, Russia was forced to launch the special operation to protect the population. Western countries were hoping to break Russia quickly, but they were wrong, he said adding that Russia managed to raise its economic sovereignty since 2022.

 Letters to the Editor: How the U.S. can fight in Ukraine without leading to nuclear war

To the editor: I read the letters to the editor, and there is a clear divide between those who think the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should confront the aggressor, or whether that’s too likely to cause an escalation in the war.

While many people draw parallels between Hitler and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, there is one very clear difference: Putin has nukes.

Nevertheless, while nuclear annihilation is a risk of escalation, appeasement of war criminals has never tamed them. If Putin is allowed to “take” Ukraine, what is to convince him, then, that “taking” Poland is not equally attainable?

At this point, I don’t like any of the alternatives. I think limited, conventional warfare is in order, utilizing lots of conventional high-tech weaponry. The war should not be escalated beyond that, even if Russia uses chemical or biological weapons.

If the Kraken is already released, what choice do we have but to confront it?

Denys Arcuri, Indio

..

To the editor: Letter writers advocating escalating use of force by the U.S. and NATO in Ukraine illustrate how Euro-centric and frankly white-centric our global views are.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is horrific and needs to be addressed forcefully by the U.S. and its allies. But why should the U.S. and NATO engage in armed conflict in the latest global tragedy while ignoring or being responsible for much larger humanitarian disasters of the past few decades, which resulted in much higher fatalities?

Like the invasion of Ukraine, these humanitarian disasters unleashed unthinkable death and destruction on innocent people. Unlike the invasion of Ukraine, they took place in nonwhite and non-European locations.

Few Americans advocated for a global power to intercede and put an end to their suffering.

 Ukraine: You Break It, We Take It

Authored by Citizen Soldier via RealClearDefense,

All Aboard! Here comes the latest Postwar Gravy Train, laden with massive government spending, lax oversight and other goodies for cunning contractors and economic opportunists seeking to benefit from the near-destruction of Ukraine.

Last week, the State Department announced it intends to seize Russian assets in the United States to help fund rebuilding efforts, though the estimated $300 billion here and in Europe won’t cover the projected price tag of $500 billion. “What Putin destroyed, Russia should – must – pay to rebuild,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

Like an earlier generation of interventionists, Blinken cites the “Pottery Barn rule” – You Break It, You Own It – to explain an aggressor’s moral obligation to rebuild. Colin Powell used the same reasoning in the summer of 2002, as a ""caution"" to President George W. Bush about the consequences of military action in Iraq. A major difference is the dollars at stake. American and European firms undoubtedly are eager to reconstruct a modern, high-tech country from the ground up.

Our government seeks every opportunity to impose itself, at home and abroad, but has a poor track record for managing projects.

No-bid contract awards, bribes and billions of missing dollars are the legacy of the Coalition Provisional Authority’s rebuilding work in Iraq, where officials concluded that not enough was accomplished for the amount of funds expended. We learned that when taxpayer money is plentiful, oversight and results will be negligible. Just imagine how generous and hands-off our government might be spending Russia’s money.

Not everyone endorses the act of confiscating Russia’s money, pointing to the principle of reciprocity as a reason to show restraint. “Stealing” the assets of a foreign country sets a dangerous precedent that could be applied against us. For example, what if China confiscates American assets to fund rebuilding projects in Libya, Iraq or other nations the United States has damaged through war?

The DC hype-meisters talk about the Great Power Competition of wannabe superpowers; they tell us that China is on the brink of becoming the dominant international force, that Russia is preparing to seize all of Europe. Here, though, the façade falls away—the elites believe the United States has no economic or military peers. When you’re as rich and mighty as America, there’s no fear of reciprocity.

The elites will do what’s in the immediate best interest of their friends, which include certain corporations and investors who will benefit from the most extensive international project since World War II. For this group, the only morality is a morality of power: Treating other nations the way you want to be treated is a rule for losers and weaker players.

Blinken and the politicians talk about our categorical imperative in Ukraine, how the world relies on America to “defend democracy” and “protect the rules-based order.” But their words ring hollow. The cynical truth is that what Russia breaks, America will take—using confiscated money to fund a massive rebuilding project that will be poorly managed, but lucrative for the chosen few involved.

 Russia on Monday said that there is currently “no basis” to hold an arms control and strategic stability dialogue with the US amid the ongoing war between Moscow and Kyiv.

“There is no basis whatsoever for an arms control and strategic stability dialogue with the United States in the face of a total hybrid war being waged against our country … It will be possible to discuss these topics only after the US authorities renounce their openly hostile anti-Russian policy,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a video address to the Moscow Nonproliferation Conference.

Lavrov expressed that efforts to reduce the potential of a conflict between Russia and the US should be “comprehensive in nature” and based on removing NATO’s eastward expansion.

He further said the West is balancing on the “dangerous edge” of a direct military confrontation between nuclear powers, indicating that Moscow is especially concerned that the three nuclear powers in the West are among Ukraine’s main supporters.

“The US-led ‘collective West’ is cynically complementing the deliberate destruction of balanced and equal agreements that do not suit Washington with the promotion of apparently dishonest schemes that would create advantages for the United States,” Lavrov also said.

He argued that the West’s goal is to create a “unilateral military advantage for themselves by setting new limits for nuclear arsenals while formalizing the aggregate Western superiority in the sphere of non-nuclear capabilities,” adding that the US and its allies are enlarging their network of alliances “directed against third countries” to achieve military superiority.

Lavrov went on to say that Russia’s move to revoke the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year was a “logical response to the destructive moves by the US and other Western countries.”

“That said, we remain a full-fledged party to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Not so long ago, we completed the formation of our segment of the International Monitoring System. We are ready to return to the issue of its ratification as soon as the US does this,” he said.

The Russian foreign minister also accused the Western countries of “tailoring” the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to their interests.

“We are convinced that to prevent further degradation of the world situation, maintain durable stability and create realistic disarmament, all countries should pool their efforts to upgrade the international security system relying on the principles of multilateralism, equality and indivisibility. This is the only way of reducing interstate conflicts and ensuring real progress in arms control,” he said.",1,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
189,EN_UA_102953.txt,"Russian celebrities labelled as 'foreign agents' for supporting Ukraine challenge Putin in court 

 A Moscow court on Monday disclosed that several Russian artists, who were labeled as “foreign agents” for publically supporting the Ukrainian government, have submitted appeals against the tagging.

According to the Zamoskvorechye district court, appeals have been filed by TV host and comedian Maksim Galkin, actor and musician Semyon Slepakov, blogger Ilya Varlamov, and singer Zemfira.

All four individuals left Russia last year and were branded as foreign agents following their public statements in favour of Kiev.

Galkin, who was designated as a foreign agent in September 2022 for engaging in “political activities” on behalf of a foreign government, appeared in a video where he was heard chanting slogans of Ukrainian nationalists during a concert in Dubai, which surfaced in January.

Galkin, a comedian known for hosting Russia’s version of the quiz show ‘Who Wants to Be a Millionaire’ from 2001 to 2008, had performed alongside Ukraine’s future President Vladimir Zelensky in a New Year’s Eve special in 2013.

Galkin, aged 46, and his wife, 73-year-old Soviet pop icon Alla Pugacheva, fled to Israel during the escalation of the Ukraine conflict.

Pugacheva condemned Galkin’s designation and expressed her demand to be included on the list as well.

Last week, Zemfira, a rock musician who rose to fame in the early 2000s, submitted her appeal to the court, according to reports.

Born as Zemfira Ramazanova, she was added to the foreign agent list in February 2023 after criticizing the “war in Ukraine” and relocating to France.

Towards the end of March, Varlamov’s inclusion in the registry was announced.

As per the Russian Ministry of Justice, the architect and video-blogger specializing in urbanism was accused of spreading false information about government policies and receiving support from foreign entities.

Notably, Varlamov had already departed from Russia by that time and claimed to have obtained a passport from Turkmenistan.

On April 14, Slepakov was designated as a foreign agent.

The Justice Ministry justified this decision by citing his receipt of support from foreign sources, his opposition to the special military operation in Ukraine, and his involvement in promoting negative sentiments towards the Russian people, military, and government.

In a satirical song released in January, Slepakov portrayed a Russian mother expressing grief over her three-year-old child not being able to participate in warfare.

The TV comedian, screenwriter, and producer had relocated to Israel before his designation.

The foreign agents law, enacted in late 2012, allows for the identification of Russian individuals and nonprofit organizations engaged in political activities and receiving funding from abroad.

Although it does not impose civil or criminal penalties, unlike its U.S. counterpart that served as its model, those labeled as foreign agents are burdened with demanding reporting obligations.

190,EN_UA_102990.txt,"At Last, a Credible Explanation of How Kakhovka Dam Was Blown Up 

 by Eric Zuesse, The Duran:

Though Western ‘news’ media have gotten their ‘explanation’ of this event from Ukraine’s Government, it never made sense that Russia would have wanted to flood, harm, and weaken, the entire western half of the territory that Russia now controls in the former Ukraine, including in Crimea (which was getting its water-supply from that dam).

The anonymous author of the “Moon of Alabama” website has a long and almost flawless record of accurately exposing realities that mainstream U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media had been hiding, and the latest such is his June 13th “Did Russia Destroy The Nova Kakhovka Dam?” His report there turns upside-down and inside-out the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ that the dam had been bombed not by a missile, but by an explosive device which had been placed there by saboteurs whom Ukraine’s Government assumes were from Russia. U.S.-Government-approved ‘news’-media accept and amplify that assumption, but “MoA” does not.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

First, he quotes the New York Times and other U.S. Government mouthpieces presenting the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ of the blow-up; and then he rips it apart by noting the extremely relevant (but in U.S.-and-occupied lands ignored) fact, that on May 12th, Britain had supplied to Ukraine its “Storm Shadow” missiles that are designed to have a two-stage bombing-operation: first, a normal surface bomb, but then after it a fuse-ignited ground-penetrating bomb to explode deeper inside even a fortified and hardened underground target such as that dam was apparently blown up.

The British-supplied Storm Shadow weapon is perfect for this type of destruction — exploding from deep underground, instead of from the surface. And whereas Russia doesn’t have any Storm Shadows, Ukraine definitely does — ever since May 12th.

The present news-report about U.S.-and-allied lies is being simultaneously submitted for publication by all of the standard U.S.-Government mouthpiece propaganda-media, just in case any of them might finally want to go beyond their standard U.S.-Government-approved sources.

Ever since at least late 2022, Russia has been warning that Ukraine’s government wants to blow up that dam. For example, on 1 November 2022, Reuters headlined “Russia announces wider evacuation of occupied southern Ukraine”, and reported that,

“Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded,” Vladimir Saldo, Russian-installed head of occupied Kherson province, said in a video message.

“Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 km from the Dnipro,” he said. “The decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians.”

Moscow has accused Kyiv of planning to use a so-called “dirty bomb” to spread radiation, or to blow up a dam to flood towns and villages in Kherson province. Kyiv says accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. …

Saldo, the Russian-imposed occupation leader for the province, identified seven towns on the east bank that would now be evacuated, comprising the main populated settlements along that stretch of the river.

Even U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media occasionally report relevant facts when they find them useful to mention in a ‘news’-report that has an anti-Russian “spin.”

So: we know that Russia’s Government was trying to protect the residents in that region against this attack, but U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media have unquestioningly accepted the Ukrainian government’s accusation that Russia’s Government did it. And, now, an extremely likely explanation has finally been provided, which implicates both Ukraine’s government and UK’s Government as having done it.",1,"['URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

 NATO Troops Are Operating In Ukraine Disguised As Mercenaries, Russian General Claims

By Magyar Nemzet of Remix News

A Russian general is claiming that NATO troops are in Ukraine, but they are being disguised as mercenaries to justify their presence, with a number of American and Polish bodies found in Avdiivka, the city recently captured by Russian forces over the last few days.

In an interview with Russian newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, General Sergei Rudskoy, chief operations director of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said that NATO military personnel are taking part in the fighting in Ukraine disguised as mercenaries.

“NATO soldiers are taking part in the fighting disguised as mercenaries. They control air defense systems for operational and tactical missiles and multiple rocket launchers, and are part of assault teams,” Rudskoy said. According to him, NATO officers directly shape the military operations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

The Russian state news agency TASS reported that the bodies of soldiers with Polish and American insignia on their clothes had been found in the Russian-controlled Avdiivka.

“The clearing of Avdiivka has revealed quite a few interesting details. In this case, bodies abandoned by Ukrainian armed units with American and Polish insignia sewn on their uniforms,” Igor Kimakovsky, an adviser to the head of the “Donetsk People’s Republic,” told Russia’s TASS/TRANS news agency.

This information cannot be independently verified.

Gen. Rudskoy claims that Ukraine is being used as a proxy against Russia.

“Western countries make no secret of their desire to inflict a strategic defeat on our country. In order to achieve this goal, Washington and Brussels have chosen Ukraine, where anti-Russian, nationalist sentiment has been nurtured since the collapse of the Soviet Union. At present, the Ukrainian people are being used by the United States as cannon fodder for its geopolitical ambitions of world domination. Therefore, the threats to our country today are no less serious than in the years of 1941-1945 last century,” said Gen. Rudskoy.

With the fall of Avdiivka, Ukraine has lost one of the most important cities on the Donetsk frontline, Many believe that the town is now serving as a second Bakhmut, as it was clear months ago that it could only be held temporarily at the cost of tens of thousands of soldiers’ lives.

 4th International Conference on SIDS: Transforming SIDS Economies through Energy Transition and Climate Action towards Prosperity, Resilience and Sustainable Development

Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have emerged as frontrunners in the global fight against climate change. The island states have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the principles outlined in the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A pivotal aspect of their dedication lies in the ambitious targets set to transition towards resilient renewable energy systems, thereby reducing fossil fuel dependency, enhancing economic resilience, and addressing pressing socio-economic challenges. The realization of SIDS' renewable energy commitments hinges upon robust partnerships with financing institutions, development partners, and relevant stakeholders for providing financial assistance, technology transfer, and capacity-building support. Collaborative efforts are vital to bolstering SIDS' resilience and prosperity through energy sector transformation.

IRENA through the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative aims to convene SIDS representatives, development partners, regional and multilateral organizations, financing institutions, and other stakeholders. Through strategic deliberations, the event sought to identify innovative financing mechanisms, facilitate technology transfer, and outline capacity-building initiatives crucial for SIDS to achieve their renewable energy commitments.

Furthermore, the key discussion points during the side event took into consideration the following aspects:

- Exploring innovative financing mechanisms tailored to the unique challenges faced by SIDS.

- Facilitating technology transfer and knowledge sharing to accelerate renewable energy adoption.

- Identifying capacity-building needs and strategies to enhance SIDS' resilience and expertise in renewable energy development.

- Fostering partnerships and collaborations to mobilize resources and support SIDS' energy transition efforts.

The expected outcomes of the side event gauged how the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative and similar SIDS focussed initiatives can facilitate:

- Enhanced understanding of the financing landscape and available mechanisms for supporting SIDS' renewable energy projects.

- Concrete strategies and action plans for facilitating technology transfer and capacity-building initiatives in SIDS.

- Strengthened partnerships and commitments towards advancing renewable energy transformation in SIDS.

- A roadmap for continued collaboration and support to ensure the realization of SIDS' renewable energy commitments.",1,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Moscow: Russia will ask the UN Security Council for an investigation into Nord Stream gas pipelines explosions in September last year for which it blames the US.

The Russian parliament’s committee for international relations has introduced the motion regarding this and is expected to get approval by the State Duma later this week.

What does the proposal say?

According to a report by TASS, the proposal calls the Baltic Sea pipelines blasts as “an act of international terrorism” and a “monstrous sabotage.""

It seeks from the United Nations to hold accountable both - who gave the order for the explosions and those who carried it out.

“The criminal act has threatened the security of all Eurasia,” the proposal stated.

Giving the reference to the report of American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, the lawmakers blamed US President Joe Biden’s administration, saying it “gave the illegal order and bears full responsibility for the multi-billion-dollar damage to the infrastructure of Russia, Germany, France and the Netherlands.""

Don’t Miss: US planted explosives along Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022 under Biden supervision, claims Seymour Hersh

They further described the pipeline sabotage as inflicting long-term damage to the security, economy and environment of the entire region.

Hersh in his report alleged that the Nord Stream gas pipelines were damaged in a joint operation between the US and Norway.

US actions require “a thorough international investigation, punishment of those responsible and compensation for the damage caused,” the proposal said.

What Seymour Hersh’s report say?

Last week, Hersh in over 5,000 words report claimed that “top secret and highly-dangerous operation” was carried out by the divers during BALTOPS22, a series of military exercises in the Baltic Sea carried out by 16 NATO countries.

According to him, divers trained at the US Navy’s Diving and Salvage Centre in Florida, planted C4 explosives on three Nord Stream pipelines in June 2022. They were detonated after three months using a sonar buoy which broadcast a signal that triggered the bombs.

He further claimed that the Nord Stream attack was carried out in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

Explosions in Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were reported on 26 September, 2022, an attack that, ostensibly, continues to puzzle investigators.

 Facebook now warns users NOT to ‘call for Putin assassination’ after controversial rule change

FACEBOOK users are now banned from calling for violence against heads of state.

Meta – the parent company of Facebook and Instagram – on Sunday clarified its recent violent speech policy to specifically not include calls for the death of a head of state.

The new announcement by Meta is likely in response to the violent posts users have been sharing towards Russian President Vladimir Putin following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""We do not permit calls to assassinate a head of state… So, in order to remove any ambiguity about our stance, we are further narrowing our guidance to make explicit that we are not allowing calls for the death of a head of state on our platforms,"" Meta global affairs President Nick Clegg said, per Reuters.

Meta's clarification came shortly after the company revealed last week that it would take a more relaxed stance on users calling for violence against Russian forces in the context of the Ukraine invasion.

""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech,"" a Meta spokesperson said.

However, it appears that Meta's initial policy sparked confusion among both Facebook and Instagram users on what type of speech is exactly permitted.

Along with banning violent calls against state leaders, the American tech company also emphasized that their new policy does not allow for hate speech towards Russian civilians.

""We are now narrowing the focus to make it explicitly clear in the guidance that it is never to be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general,"" Clegg said.

""Meta stands against Russophobia. We have no tolerance for calls for genocide, ethnic cleansing, or any kind of discrimination, harassment, or violence towards Russians on our platform,"" Clegg added.

Last Friday, the Kremlin opened a court case against Meta in direct retaliation to the social media giant's violent speech policy.

""A criminal case has been initiated … in connection with illegal calls for murder and violence against citizens of the Russian Federation by employees of the American company Meta,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said, according to Reuters.

The Russian prosecutor general's office asked a court to designate Meta an ""extremist organization"" and ban it from operating in the country after the social media giant changed its hate speech rules on Friday, per the Wall Street Journal.

The prosecutor's office added that Meta's actions not only constitute terrorist activity but also incite ""hatred and enmity"" towards Russian citizens.

Several weeks ago, Russia also announced that it would block civilians' access to Facebook and since then the media platform has been heavily restricted.

 Another day, another fatuous ‘fact’ check from Reuters. This time the news agency accuses the Daily Sceptic of “cherry-picking” Arctic sea ice extent data to provide a “misleading” story. Being accused of “cherry picking” by an outfit that funds a course for journalists that encourages them to pick a fruit such as a mango and discuss why it isn’t as tasty as the year before due to climate change is beyond ridicule. Taking lectures on responsible journalism from a Net Zero-obsessed operation that has promoted a course speaker who has suggested “fines and imprisonments” for expressing scepticism about “well supported” science is laughable, if also a tad sinister.

One of the activists called to admonish the Daily Sceptic with a ‘straw man’ argument was Walt Meier, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, who said: “Comparing two specific years is not an indicator for or against long-term changes”. The Daily Sceptic did not do that. Interestingly, this would appear to be the same Walt Meier whose comments on ”mind blowing” low winter levels of Antarctica sea ice last year made headlines around the world. Meier claimed at the time that it was “outside anything we have seen”. Happily, the Daily Sceptic was able to remind Meier that he had been part of a team a decade ago that cracked open the secrets of early Nimbus weather satellites and found a similar sea ice low in 1966. At the time, Meier commented that the Nimbus data show there is variability in Antarctica sea ice “that’s larger than any we have seen” since 1979.

Which parts of Ukraine has Russia invaded?

Russia has made large sweeps in the south of Ukraine, using Crimea and the separatist supporters in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Troops moved into the Kherson region from Crimea - a territory that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Kherson and Melitopol areas of Ukraine are under control of Russian forces.

There is strong Russian presence in Chernobyl and the surrounding area.

Northern cities of Chernihiv and Konotop, which are closest to the Russian and Belarusian borders, have also been taken.

Why has Russia invaded Ukraine?

Unrest in the Donbas region began in 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea.

Pro-Russian demonstrations escalated into fighting with the Ukraine government forces.

The Minsk agreement of 2015 – between the separatist leaders, Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany – sought to end fighting in the region but without success.

The much feared Russian advance began in the early hours on February 21, 2022, soon after Putin announced he recognised Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states in a bombastic TV address.

Joe Biden and Boris Johnson condemned the move as an ""invasion"" and slapped sanctions on Russian banks and Putin's billionaire cronies.

 NEW YORK—An employee of Russian state television who interrupted a live news program to protest the war in Ukraine was released from custody Tuesday and fined about $270, but still could face a prison sentence.

Marina Ovsyannikova told reporters she was not allowed to sleep while held in police custody and that she was interrogated for 14 hours.

Ovsyannikova, an employee of Channel 1, walked behind the presenter during Monday’s evening news show with a poster saying “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.” In English, it said “no war” at the top of the poster and “Russians against the war” at the bottom.

In a video recorded earlier, she urged Russians to join anti-war protests and said that “Russia is the aggressor country and one person, Vladimir Putin, solely bears responsibility for that aggression.”

The state news agency Tass said Ovsyannikova was fined for the video and remains under investigation for the on-air protest under a law banning dissemination of “deliberately false information” about the use of Russian armed forces. The new law carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence.

198,EN_UA_008072.txt,"Putin Mobilizes More Troops, Hints at Nuclear Weapon Use in Conflict Over Ukraine 

 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 21 accused Western powers of engaging in nuclear blackmail and put his country onto an enhanced wartime footing, ordering a partial military mobilization and vowing to use “all means available” in the event of a threat against Russia and its people.

“Those that allow such statements shall be reminded that our country also has various weapons of mass destruction,” including some that are more advanced than those in NATO’s arsenal, he added, according to a translation of his remarks by Sky News.

Accusations Against the WestPutin accused the West of seeking to “weaken, divide and ultimately destroy” Russia, according to an official Kremlin translation of part of his speech, which was posted on the Kremlin website.

Claiming that Western powers had concocted these plans long ago, Putin said they fomented anti-Russia terrorist activity in the Caucasus, moved “NATO’s offensive infrastructure” near his country’s borders, nurtured “hatred for Russia for decades,” and intended to set up Ukraine as an “anti-Russia bridgehead.”

Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian state television that Putin’s mobilization order would encompass reservists but wouldn’t include students or anyone without prior military service.

The Russian leadership has been reluctant to order a broad military mobilization, portraying the invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation” that’s limited in scope.

Putin’s order marks the first time since World War Two that a military mobilization of Russian citizens has been invoked.

Critical ReactionsPutin’s move drew critical reactions from Western leaders and Ukrainian officials.

Bridget Brink, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, took to Twitter to describe Putin’s order as a sign of “weakness” and “failure.”

Britain’s Defense Secretary Ben Wallace was cited by The Scotsman as saying that Putin’s order amounts to an admission of failure.

“Putin’s breaking of his own promises not to mobilize parts of his population and the illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine, are an admission that his invasion is failing,” Wallace said.

“No amount of threats and propaganda can hide the fact that Ukraine is winning the war, the international community are united, and Russia is becoming a pariah,” he added.

 DRAMATIC video shows a tank storming across the border from Ukraine into Russia today as anti-Putin soldiers claimed to have seized villages.

Drones were also reportedly used in the ""invasion"" as explosions rang out along the frontier in the Belgorod region - where the local governor issued a desperate ""don't panic"" message to residents.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, told residents that to ensure safety of citizens in the region, a ""counter-terrorist regime"" has been introduced.

Russian authorities said a ""Ukrainian Army sabotage group"" crossed the border and forces were ""taking measures to eliminate the enemy"".

Ukrainian intelligence said those involved in the incursion were ""solely Russian nationals"".

The provocative move was claimed by the Freedom of Russia Legion, a unit made up of ethnic Russian volunteers and defectors from the Russian army to fight alongside Ukraine.

In an unverified video today, members of the anti-Putin group posed in front of a road sign and an armoured car.

They claimed: ""We have again crossed the border of the Russian Federation. Russia will soon be free.

""The time to fight for the freedom of Russia has come.

""We want our children to grow up in peace and be free people... but that has no place in today's Putin's Russia.""

Armoured vehicles with Ukrainian markings were also spotted near the border, further fuelling rumours of an invasion by pro-Ukraine Russian saboteurs.

Smoke was spotted in multiple locations near border checkpoints in the region, along with videos online appearing to show a Russian soldier dead inside a checkpoint building.

And a helicopter was reportedly seen flying low over houses and deploying anti-missile flares in Rakitnoye, some 30 miles from the Grayvoron border crossing where the tank was spotted.

One post showed a radio message urgently telling Belgorod citizens to evacuate the area.

Governor Gladkov told residents earlier today: ""No one is hurt, the evacuation from Shebensky district is a lie.

""I urge you not to listen to enemies and not to panic.""

In a post on Telegram, the Freedom of Russia Legion shared a photo of a ""free Russia"" flag on a bridge.

They said: ""The first flags of free Russia met the dawn over the liberated cities. Raise the flags in your cities too. Freedom is near!""

The group claimed they had taken control of Kozinka and Gora-Podol villages.

Rumours spread that up to six other villages came under drone and mortar fire.

The flag raised in the photo is the flag used by Russian anti-war protesters - many of whom live in eastern Ukraine - and is also displayed on the Freedom of Russia Legion's Telegram channel.

It describes them as ""free citizens of Russia"" who are fighting against the ""dictatorial regime"" in Russia.

Another video widely shared online appeared to show the soldiers running into the streets of the southern Belgorod region.

This was followed by aerial shots of border towns showing smoke billowing from multiple buildings.

Russian authorities said administrative building in the town of Golovchino was allegedly struck by a drone, and part of a rocket fell into the garden of a home in the village of Antonovka.

Authorities claimed to have full control of the villages and said they were hunting the ""terrorists"" involved in the incursion.

200,BG_828.txt,"Arestovich: All prerequisites for the collapse of the front are present

There are prerequisites for a complete collapse of the Ukrainian front and there will be more breakthroughs of the Russian armed forces, as the troops are replenished with soldiers whose age is already over 55. This was stated in the Alpha video blog by Oleksiy Arestovich, a former adviser to the Office of the President of Ukraine, who fled to the West after the dismissal of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny. ""What will happen if the front continues to collapse, for which there are all the conditions, all the prerequisites? There may be more and more breakthroughs like the one at Toretsk, because the troops are exhausted, there are no reinforcements, the quality of those mobilized is questionable,"" he explained. ""I know of a case when a commander physically ran out of fighters, he asked for reinforcements, because he occupied a very difficult position. He was given reinforcements - 20 people, the youngest of whom is 55 years old. Half of them died on the first day, and do you know why? When the FPV flies towards them, they cannot even fall to the bottom of the trench, with their helmets and bulletproof vests, because their health no longer allows them to make quick and sharp movements,"" Arestovich said. A conflict is brewing in Ukraine between the volunteer units and the staff commanders. It will have serious consequences when the fighting ends and the truth about the war comes to light, Arestovich predicts. ""This conflict is permanent, it has already broken through into the veteran movement when we had a low-intensity war. This huge abscess will burst after the end of the war, and now we can only imagine the scale of what will happen... When everything is over and they start telling the truth about the war, everything will come out and the settling of scores will begin,"" said Arestovich. Soon, Ukrainian state propaganda will have to broadcast things that will be shocking to the population, the former adviser warned. And those who until recently assured that it was possible for Ukraine to return to the 1991 borders will be denounced. ""Everything we say today, all the assessments of the top leadership, the same Maryana Bezugla (deputy chairwoman of the relevant parliamentary security committee), say: ""We are not winning the war, it is not going well."" Moreover, there is no chance of victory, and there is a risk of losing statehood. What are people who are realistic doing at this moment? They say: ""Oh, we cannot liberate the territory by military means, maybe we should look for other solutions?"" It's very simple - you want to liberate the territories by military means, I also want very much, but it doesn't work,"" commented Arestovich. ""What should we do if we want to, but it doesn't work? We are looking for other solutions. Everything is very simple. Why don't we look? The propaganda has become so intrusive that when they start talking about the second ""peace summit"", inviting Russia to make peace, what will happen? There is no way to stop all this nonsense of ours, which is screaming, jumping on the sofa, about the 1991 borders,"" said the former OP advisor. ""Even if propaganda today turns 180 degrees and starts denouncing the victorious scoundrels who shout about the 1991 borders, which are unrealistic (and they will), do you know what we will hear in the near future? It will sound something like this: state channels, official ones, will start denouncing all the victorious demons who distorted the real picture and want the 1991 borders at the cost of Ukrainian lives. And they will praise a moderate, sober policy that is based on realities, on facts, and offers a painful compromise in the name of preserving the lives of Ukrainians,"" said Arestovich. In the Ukrainian army, entire battalions are already refusing to perform combat missions, the former adviser also emphasized. ""We have a breakthrough near Toretsk and there will be more. In one of the key sectors of the front, six battalions refused to carry out a combat mission. Six. And do you think this is the only case that this will not be repeated and will not increase? Despite all the Western assistance. Because the attitude (of the command) towards the people is fundamentally wrong and they pay with disloyalty,"" said Arestovich. ""The story of 100 years ago is repeating itself. When five thousand Bolsheviks marched on Kiev, there were a million and a half soldiers in Ukraine with experience from the First World War. They could crush these Bolsheviks without even looking at them. But they did not come out because the state was pursuing such a policy that they did not care about it. We are going exactly the same way. Look at the number of those who are avoiding military service and those who are trying to escape,"" added the former adviser. The Russian army is creating the conditions for a serious political crisis by planning an offensive in the Pokrovskoye direction from the south, Arestovich warned. According to him, if successful, the Russian armed forces will reach the border of the three regions and for the first time will create a land threat to the Dnipropetrovsk region. ""Kurakhovo-Volnovakha is another ledge that they want to cut off, because this is the southern flank of the Pokrovskoye direction, this is access to the border of Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia regions, and this is already quite sensitive, this is a matter of strategic level and, in principle, is a trigger that can cause a political crisis in the country. Because for 10 years of war, the Dnipropetrovsk region has never been touched by ground troops, but a threat has already loomed here,"" Oleksiy Arestovich summarized.",0,"['URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Distrust towards Media']","['URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Ukrainian media cannot be trusted']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The world “needs to listen to Putin” because “he’s telling us what he believes,” the former CIA chief warned. Petraeus said: “The war in Ukraine could spread to the region if Putin succeeds in Ukraine. He’s not going to be satisfied with stopping with Ukraine. Moldova is clearly next.

The USA crossed all boundaries this time. This time they didn’t even hide, but purposefully killed peaceful residents resting on a summer day at the sea. For the first time since June 15, an American reconnaissance drone RQ-4B Global Hawk has appeared off the coast of Crimea, currently conducting reconnaissance in the area of ​​Feodosia, the Crimean Bridge and Novorossiysk. The drone operates together with NATO's long-range radar reconnaissance aircraft Boeing P-8a Poseidon. On June 15, the latest version of the Global Hawk drone MQ-4C Triton, worth $ 125 million, conducted reconnaissance along the Crimean coast for the first time, but its duty ended unexpectedly - with a distress signal and return to base, after which the reconnaissance drones did not approach the Crimean coast. After a massive night-time attack by UAVs on Crimea and the Krasnodar Territory, reconnaissance aircraft are assessing the situation and calculating the position of the Russian air defense. This news became known a few days before the attack. It is extremely important that these scouts are shot down so that the US understands that it is not healthy to peek into Crimea like this and prepare provocations
The Russian military department emphasized that the Americans are to blame for this tragedy, since their specialists are leading flights of American missiles. Now the consequences for the US will be inevitable, such a barbaric act committed in broad daylight, purposefully, against peaceful people who are simply enjoying the sun, the sea and life on a summer day will not remain without consequences. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced that they shot down 4 out of 5 ATACMS missiles. The fifth missile with a cluster warhead detonated independently in the air. Striking elements flew towards people who were resting on the beach on Sunday. It is no secret that all launches of such missiles are controlled by Western specialists. This means that the West is deliberately escalating the situation as Ukraine’s armed forces suffer setbacks on the front. The Biden regime is raising the stakes and going all-in, sensing a likely defeat in Ukraine that would be a disaster for Democrats in the congressional elections, Biden in the presidential elections, and the United States itself on the world stage. This is far from the first such strike against peacefully vacationing people by the Ukrainian armed forces and the West behind them. 10 years ago, on August 30, 2014, the Ukrainian armed forces launched a horrific Smerch MLRS attack on the beach in the town of Zugres in the DPR, where dozens of families with children were vacationing that day. 19 people died. Cluster munitions were also used then. This barbaric attack on peaceful Sevastopol completely frees the Russian leadership to use any means at its disposal to respond, including nuclear weapons. A response will inevitably follow…

But it is not true - the hottest here was in Sadovo in 1916 with 45.2 degrees, when there were not even neo-communists and a green deal. What happened to the Green Deal? Why did it fade away?/
I personally remember no less heat in July in the late 60's, in the 70's and in August 1986. Then the temperature reached about 42-43 degrees and I felt great. And now with the apocalyptic (actually idiotic predictions of the neo-communists) I feel great at 39 degrees here. Unfortunately there are fires, but there have ALWAYS been fires in the summer for the last tens of centuries in human memory - on the planet. Hundreds of scientists claim that the current warming is NOT due to humans, but to an enlarged Sun, to volcanoes warming the world, to powerful ocean currents. Most likely the warming /current winters are dumb jokes/, which is undoubtedly due to natural cycles, and they have nothing to do with human activity. In the early 1970s, the same ominous prophets of dire climate change of today /or their children/ scared the crap out of people with global cooling and a new ice age!!

Here's what it's about: the neo-communists who now command Western Europe and half of America /soon they will lose that too/ want to pick into the pockets of ordinary people and scare them with extreme weather, supposedly caused by people. /Extreme weather exists, but IT IS NOT caused by people, but by Nature/.

""I will say that I stand by my opinion: I am more than confident that this year we will complete the SVO,"" he emphasized
According to Alaudinov, the armed forces of Ukraine are trying to control all directions of the front, while the Russian armed forces capture new settlements every few days. At the same time, the commander of Akhmat indicated that even after the victory of Russia they will want to harm it, but nothing will come of it.

If current levels of greenhouse gas emissions continue and no action is taken in time, rising sea levels are expected to destroy about 50% of Cyprus' beaches in the next 50 years, BTA reports, citing George Zitis, an associate research fellow at the Center of Excellence for Climate and Atmospheric Research at the Cyprus Institute. Speaking to KNA, Dr. Zitis pointed out that climate change is making Cyprus warmer and drier with multiple impacts on nature, human health and the economy. He noted that even if we stop gas emissions today, temperatures are expected to continue rising over the next 20-30 years, and therefore measures are needed to adapt to the new conditions. ""Cyprus and the wider Eastern Mediterranean region are mainly affected by increasing temperatures, especially during the summer season,"" he told KNA, noting that in other parts of the world, such as Northern Europe, the increase in temperature is mainly observed in winter. This increases the consequences, as Cyprus is located in a particularly warm region. These consequences, Dr. Zitis added, affect energy consumption, agricultural production and human health. ""We recently had two deaths from heatstroke,"" he said. He also noted that forest fires are also linked to high summer temperatures. Another characteristic of the region that Dr. Zitis pointed out is that the increase in temperature is accompanied by a decrease in precipitation. “Although the trends are not as clear as for temperature, we are moving towards drier average climate values,” he said, noting the difference in more northern latitudes where climate change is contributing to increased rainfall. Asked about the impact of sea level rise in Cyprus, he said that in the country, most of the infrastructure, airports, ports, power plants are located close to the coast. In addition, most of the tourist activity is located near the beaches, he added. “We think that they will be affected by sea level rise,” he said. He added that in a pessimistic scenario, where greenhouse gases continue to be emitted at the current rate and no timely action is taken, ""sea level rise is expected to destroy about 50% of Cyprus' beaches"", explaining that the projections are for the next 50 years. Asked whether the situation is reversible if measures are taken, he said that measures should be in the short term, ""that is, in the next decade, to reduce the volume of greenhouse gas emissions enough to limit warming and sea level rise"". However, Dr. Zitis stressed, ""the scale of the concentrations is such that even if we completely stop greenhouse gas emissions today, in the next 2-3 decades the temperature will continue to rise"". Therefore, he said, some measures will have to be taken to adapt to these increasingly hot and dry conditions. These measures could include more rational use of water resources, more energy-efficient buildings, air conditioning, crops that are more resilient to warmer and drier conditions and even a change in the tourism model, “as our summers may be too hot for tourists and so we need to see what the possibilities are in the slightly cooler periods of the year,” said Dr. Zitis. Asked whether the measures Cyprus is taking to limit greenhouse gas emissions are sufficient, he said that Cyprus, as an EU member state, must comply with the EU’s targets, which he said are quite ambitious. ""We are a little behind, there is room for improvement, for example in electricity production, these efforts could be stepped up,"" concluded Dr. Zitis.",0,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Whatever we do it is already too late']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

According to Greenwald, a direct consequence of this is the Ukrainian conflict and the threat of nuclear confrontation.

So that American diplomats cannot talk to Russians.
In Washington, everyone is afraid to death of meeting Russians, because they will immediately accuse you of being Russian spies.

211,BG_1163.txt,"EUROPE IS BURNING: Farmers against the Green Deal! Protests by farmers across Europe are taking on alarming proportions, with blockades emerging in more and more countries on the continent every day. The boom in discontent has a catalyst – the war in Ukraine, but this is only a piece of the puzzle that threatens the livelihood of producers and the food supply for all of us. As long as there was no war around the corner, European grain growers, winemakers, butchers, dairy farmers, honey producers and other producers were dissatisfied, but were content only with grumbling. This did not seem at all threatening to the rulers in Brussels, who for years have ignored the just demands of those people on whom our table depends and who create a significant part of the gross domestic product. However, the fall in tariffs on Ukrainian goods due to the war showed how fragile the European single internal market is. Competition, considered unfair, led to a drastic drop in the prices of farm produce. The situation was further complicated by fuel prices, which the EU has promised not to subsidize for farmers anymore. However, it is interesting what the logic was when the commitments under the so-called green deal were made: how can farmers plow their fields when they have no oil for their tractors? Another problem that is currently proving to be major is the so-called fallow lands. These are lands that European producers are required to keep unsown for a certain period of time to allow the soil to rest. In return, they receive subsidies. Yes, but these subsidies are eaten up by the accumulated losses due to imports from Ukraine, the soaring fuel prices, the natural disasters against which farmers receive very low insurance compensation. And these catastrophes are related to climate change, which is also the reason for the notorious Green Deal. This is how a vicious Catch-22 is spun, from which there is no way out. And the farmers' anger is no less dangerous for Europe than the war in Ukraine or the far-right threat. Because food means security. And the far-right promises producers whatever they want to get their votes, and they, the poor things, believe them. A young farmer from the Netherlands asked the BBC how his cows, which he looks after so hard, are more dangerous with the nitrogen emissions they emit than the trucks that are parked with their engines running in a depot next to his farm. And he is absolutely right. Now the EU will either want to or will not make temporary concessions to the farmers' demands, because otherwise Europe will burn with unpredictable consequences. France has already given up on the drop in oil subsidies, and the rule on unsown land will probably be abolished in a year. But postponing the problems piecemeal will not solve them. Finding a compromise between green energy and agriculture should become the number one topic in the expensive offices of officials in Brussels. Hopefully they will understand this sooner, because everything said so far affects Bulgaria one hundred percent.",0,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of the EU', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit']",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Russian cyber blitzkrieg was abruptly interrupted – Elon Musk began urgently delivering tens of thousands of Starlink terminals to Ukraine, connecting the country back to the global network via its broadband satellites
Before the Kremlin’s troops crossed the borders of Ukraine, the Russian Federation launched a secret mission that they were sure would help them achieve a quick victory in the blitzkrieg. Russian military intelligence organized a cyber ambush, hitting ground stations of the American satellite network, on which the connection between the country’s top leadership and the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) depended, Forbes magazine reports, quoted by “Focus”. “The attack quickly destroyed tens of thousands of Viasat modems, threatening vital links connecting Kiev to its defenders across the country and to allies around the world,” the article says. According to one of the leading experts on space defense in the United States, Victoria Samson, director of the Space Security and Stability Division at the Secure World Foundation, a think tank, “isolating the Ukrainian high command behind a digital iron curtain as Russian tanks rushed to capture the capital was part of a larger mission to suffocate the vigilante defenders of democracy in the fog of war.” The primary goal of this mission, she says, was to destroy Kiev’s connections to American satellites that had allowed the Ukrainian resistance to be coordinated. In other words, Russia wanted to quickly crush Kiev’s ability to use advanced space technology. All of this was recently documented in a report compiled by experts at the Center for Naval Analysis (CNA). After reviewing treatises and orders issued by the Russian military, they reported that “controlling access to space information was seen as providing a huge advantage in terms of improving combat capabilities.” “Russian top defense strategists believed that it was critical to destroy the enemy’s ground-based space infrastructure early in the war… to disable enemy command,” the CNA report said. The Kremlin generals attached great importance to the destruction of Ukrainian space technology at the very beginning of the war – and this is confirmed by carefully synchronized Russian attacks on the Viasat network. “Russian forces deliberately attacked Viasat terminals in an attempt to disrupt Ukrainian military communications during the invasion of Ukraine. Russia never officially admitted that it was behind the attacks, but the US and its EU partners officially announced this in May 2022,” Samson recalls. At the same time, it is noted that the Russian cyber blitzkrieg was abruptly interrupted – Elon Musk began urgently delivering tens of thousands of Starlinks to Ukraine, connecting the country back to the global network via its broadband satellites. “The Russians were furious,” Forbes writes, “Putin began sending envoys to UN meetings to threaten that his space force might start shooting down American satellites, but by then the hopelessness of that goal must have become obvious to the Russian leadership.” It is emphasized that Russia has fewer than 200 satellites, compared to the more than 6,000 launched by SpaceX alone. “They have not prepared for an extended conflict with an adversary who has access to more private information than they do. The Russian military appears to continue to face an information gap due to the limitations of its forces and the lack of access to Western commercial imagery,” noted James Clay Moltz, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School at Monterey. According to him, despite the successful attack on Viasat’s ground terminals, Russia failed to achieve its main goal – to deprive the Ukrainian military of access to space information. “Russia clearly did not expect Ukraine to receive cooperation from Western countries and commercial services that it itself does not have access to,” Molts adds. It is noted that after issuing a barrage of threats to strike Western satellites coming to the aid of Ukraine, Putin’s inner circle probably concluded that “destroying one or two Western satellites with the anti-satellite weapons that he has been testing will not contribute to overcoming Russia’s gap with American space power.” Naval War College professor David Burbach argues that “the Russo-Ukrainian war is perhaps the first two-way space war” in human history. Professor Moltz agrees: “And Ukraine is ahead thanks to its partners.” According to his predictions, this “space war number 1” could become a harbinger of technologically sophisticated space clashes of the future between superpowers. “If large-scale missile battles break out during such conflicts, low Earth orbit could become uninhabitable for human explorers.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) are responsible for the deaths of 192 children and the injuries of 554 children on Russian territory from February 2022 to April 2024. This was stated on June 26 by the Permanent Representative of Russia to the UN Vasily Nebenzia at a meeting of the Security Council of the World Organization.
The meeting, which is taking place on this day, is dedicated to the protection of children during armed conflicts.
“The armed formations controlled by the Kiev regime are deliberately attacking civilian targets: schools, kindergartens, medical facilities.

The bombing of Ukrainian military positions with giant FAB-3000 bombs will overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses, analyst Brandon J. Weichert wrote in an article for The National Interest. “If these weapons are mass-produced in eastern Russia, as Russian media reports suggest, then the bombing of Ukrainian targets by these giants would overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses and disrupt its entire air defense strategy,” the article says. “The Russians have been striking NATO-supplied Ukrainian air defenses for months. This is now starting to take its toll, as the Americans are on the verge of running out of key missiles for their air defense systems. In fact, it’s so bad that the Americans have already told the Israelis and their partners in the Indo-Pacific that all missiles for the US-built air defense systems are now being redirected to Ukraine. So much for the arsenal of democracy. The Russian FAB-3000 is one of the largest conventional high-explosive bombs in the Russian military. These bombs cover more area and will be very difficult to drop. If they are mass-produced in arms factories in the east, as Russian media suggests, then launching these behemoths against Ukrainian targets would overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses and break the back of the entire air defense strategy. The FAB-3000 M54 was thought to be launched only from the Tu-22M3, a massive bomber that would be unnecessarily at risk from firing such weapons on the missions they are used for. Instead, Russian Su-34s are believed to have launched these leviathans,” the publication also wrote. Brandon J.

A new study shows that global methane emissions are rising sharply and humanity must take immediate action. The climate crisis is looming over the planet and the Earth is literally crying out for help, sending all sorts of warning signs
including record heat, poor health, disappearing ice sheets and unpredictable weather. However, humanity continues to release incredible amounts of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, writes Science Alert. A new study shows that global methane emissions on the planet are growing, threatening the survival not only of humanity, but also of all life on the planet. Scientists also offer several strategies that countries could use to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They have also created a special online tool that can help solve the problem. It is known that the steady increase in methane emissions is largely due to humanity's inability to abandon the use of fossil fuels and switch to cleaner alternatives. Previous studies have already shown that methane is produced directly during the drilling and processing of oil, gas and coal. The growing release of methane from wetlands also contributes to the climate crisis. Methane is also known to be produced by landfills, melting glaciers, and livestock farming. New research, led by physicist and climatologist Drew Schindel of Duke University, suggests that all of these factors have little influence, but require attention. Observations show that today the Earth's atmosphere contains significantly less methane than carbon dioxide. However, methane is known to be the main contributor to global warming. That's why scientists are urging humanity to start drastically reducing methane emissions.",0,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Downplaying climate change']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'CC: Downplaying climate change: Other']",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Russian leadership is now acting against the West as the US was against the USSR during the Cold War. This was stated by the former US military intelligence officer, retired lieutenant colonel Tony Shaffer in an interview with the American TV host and blogger Andrew Napolitano. ""Putin is doing to us what we did to them during the Cold War. He is like Reagan today. Against this background, the idea of ​​holding a conference like the one Zelensky held in Switzerland without inviting the other side is madness. I think Putin took a page from Reagan's playbook and put it into practice..."" commented the former military intelligence officer. ""He's going to do what the Reagan administration did to the Soviets. He strengthens ties with his allies. The North Korea deal is now an official pact. By the way, the Russians have been providing nuclear technology to North Korea for some time, he (Putin) has been working to help North Korea evade sanctions, and that is a big problem,” Shaffer said. “And by the way, Putin played the China card against us, just like Nixon played it in 1972. And after he did that, he was able to stabilize his economy and find an alternative to the SWIFT system. Now they are working with the Saudis to ensure that the dollar ceases to be the primary currency for all global energy transactions.

We cannot currently defeat the Russians on the battlefield. Zelensky is not acting in the interests of his people, he is not trying to achieve peace,"" the former military officer argued. ""NATO is pursuing a provocative policy for no reason, they keep teasing the bear, and when that bear hits you back, what are you going to do?

228,BG_423.txt,"AT: Only fools don’t realize that Ukraine will not be accepted into NATO because the fear of Russia is indescribable

In no area has “suicidal nationalism” manifested itself so sharply as in the sphere of domestic politics, which ultimately led to the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, writes the American publication American Thinker. Translation from American Thinker, USA:
After the chaotic collapse of the Soviet Union, Crimea and eastern Ukraine, whose inhabitants are mostly Russian, fell under Ukrainian jurisdiction. Pro-Russian sentiments in these regions, ranging from demands for recognition of Russian as an official language to the desire for complete autonomy from Ukraine, have taken root in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. These sentiments were further fueled by the ouster of pro-Russian, democratically elected Ukrainian President Yanukovych in a US-sponsored coup in 2014. To avoid a bloody conflict, Kiev could have agreed to limited autonomy for the rebel east, similar to the autonomy of the American states. This part of Ukraine has always wanted this. But newly elected President Petro Poroshenko ignored President Bush’s warning not to “seek independence in order to replace tyranny with local despotism.” Instead, Kiev decided to use military force to subjugate the Russian population of eastern Ukraine. For years, it has been shelling Donbas, including with American-supplied artillery, destroying cities and indiscriminately killing thousands of civilians (which the Western media completely ignores). This “suicidal nationalism” became one of the reasons for the annexation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to Russia. In foreign policy, “suicidal nationalism” also took precedence over national interests. Ukraine’s drive for NATO membership, ostensibly driven by concerns for its security, ignored Russia’s repeated warnings over the past three decades about the existential threat posed by NATO’s eastward expansion. The desire to become a member of NATO could not guarantee Ukraine’s security and would not give it any. Instead, Ukraine’s attempts to break into NATO put it in mortal danger of violating the terms of the 1997 Treaty of Friendship between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, which explicitly stipulates Ukraine’s neutrality (section 6, p. 148). Ukraine’s relentless pursuit of NATO membership, fueled by political inexperience, recklessness, and heavy reliance on foreign aid, was an illusory goal that did not serve national goals and tragically led to a preventable military conflict.

Almost all political and business leaders in Europe and the Middle East believe that the Ukrainian conflict will end with Ukraine's final cession of some territory to Russia - perhaps Donetsk, Donbass and the southern Black Sea coast to Crimea. From time to time, someone suggests that Russia will be able to occupy the entire territory of the country, writes the American publication The Hill, quoted by ""Focus"". But no one suggests that Ukraine will be able to completely and permanently expel the Russians from Ukrainian territory. If this is so, if the most likely outcome in Ukraine is some kind of division of the country, then why are we not now having real discussions about ending the war, the author asks. France is currently considering sending French troops to the front under the guise of “advisors.” And the United States has recently openly approved the use of Western weapons against certain limited targets in Russia. Such actions only increase the risk of the war going beyond its current borders. But these steps by France and the United States do not increase the likelihood of a complete victory for Ukraine. While Western military equipment and logistical support may improve Kiev’s capabilities, it clearly lacks manpower. Nothing short of a full-scale Western military intervention can drive the Russians out. According to The Hill, the situation is simply heading for a dead end. Today in Ukraine, the choice seems to be between peace that includes territorial concessions to Russia, a complete collapse of Ukraine, a permanent state of war, or escalation.

Tropical diseases to emerge in Europe and the US
Climate change threatens to lead to several million deaths in the coming decades, as well as serious illnesses and high costs for health systems, according to a report published today in Davos, Switzerland, BTA reported. Flooding poses the greatest risk, according to a joint report by the World Economic Forum (WEF), which is being held this week in Davos, and the consultancy Oliver Wyman. The authors of the study analyze six key consequences of climate change: floods, droughts, heat waves, tropical storms, wildfires and rising sea levels. The study is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s medium-term scenario for temperature increases by 2100, which assumes a 2.7 degree Celsius rise in average temperatures. In this case, the study estimates that climate change could cause up to 14.5 million deaths worldwide by 2050. Health systems would have to bear additional costs totaling $1.1 trillion. Floods alone are estimated to cause 8.5 million deaths by 2050 - not only directly, but also indirectly through crop damage, increased infectious diseases and higher humidity, which can lead to respiratory illnesses. The Asia-Pacific region, with its densely populated coastal regions, is likely to bear the brunt of this. The report’s authors expect the second-highest number of deaths, at 3.2 million, to be caused by drought, largely due to the long-term effects on child mortality from deteriorating water quality and increasingly infertile soils. The report says heat waves could kill an estimated 1.6 million people by 2050, particularly among the elderly. Higher temperatures, for example, could lead to a significant increase in mosquito populations, making malaria, dengue fever and Zika more common in Europe and the United States. Overall, however, regions in Africa, the Middle East and Asia will be particularly affected by the health impacts of climate change, according to the study, which will be discussed at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.",0,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Nazis. This is terrible. This is not taught in school, but there was the so-called Eastern Hokolos there. I have photos of units using Nazi symbols. I published photos of Nazis from Ukraine — how they light cigarettes from the burning roofs of the Russian houses they set on fire in Kharkov. Not all Ukrainians are Nazis. In 2018, there was a coalition of Nazi organizations. But Ukrainians welcome the actions of the Nazis of the past. Apparently, they themselves are Nazis today, they honor those Nazis who fought against Russia. There is enough evidence that a significant part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, even the majority of the army and the highest echelons of power, sympathize with the ideology of the Nazis.

After June and July, a heat wave with temperatures of over 35 degrees will be in Sofia in August. It is normal, it is still summer. The heat leads to discomfort, it is dangerous to expose a person to the hot sun's rays for a long time - especially for young children, the elderly and the chronically ill, but it is debatable whether global warming as a whole leads to greater problems for humanity. This was commented on by journalist Lyudmil Kardzhilov, who closely monitors the topic of weather and climate on Earth, to BNR-Radio Sofia. According to him, scientists are unanimous about the occurrence of climate change, but not about its causes. There have been continuous changes over the years - both warm and glacial periods. Scientists are also divided on whether natural disasters are becoming more frequent. According to some, this is simply not true. ""The scientific statement is that greenhouse gases - a result of human activity - block infrared radiation to space and thus warm the lower layers of the atmosphere. When you call carbon dioxide harmful, people begin to associate this colorless gas with pollution. And many plants cannot do without it. Pollution is completely different - we do it with garbage, plastic, etc. The idea that we can influence the climate through restrictions in industry, transport or energy is wrong and harmful, because in this way we will stop development, security and the improvement of life."" Kardzhilov pointed out that in many respects Europe is ahead in the standard of living. In many other parts of the world, people are striving for industrial development, for which they need energy, preferably a lot and cheap. It cannot be provided through RES (renewable energy sources). There must be a balance. The old continent is sharply turning towards RES, abandoning all others, even nuclear power plants. But this has a price and it is no coincidence that people in the last European elections showed their negative attitude towards the Green Deal. We may not deprive ourselves of other energy production, there are technological solutions to reduce the impact on the environment, the journalist emphasized. ""The transition to green energy is a good idea, because it is cleaner. But this must be done sensibly, balanced, let's see what we can do for the environment, without leading to impoverishment of people,"" Kardzhilov also said. Solar panels will not solve the problem. A good way to store energy has not yet been found. Batteries are not a solution because there is nowhere to store them, and they also pollute. ""Warming is not dangerous, categorically. This is cyclical. There have been other warm periods. We should not worry about warming at the moment. If the climate changes dangerously, we will have a problem with food production and nutrition. 30-40 years ago we produced 400 million tons of wheat, now we produce nearly 800 million tons per year - Lyudmil Kardzhilov also pointed out. - A warmer climate contributes to the production of more food.

It is surprising that the West did not even try to put pressure on Kiev, which promised not to strike civilians. The shelling of civilian objects in Sevastopol with American missiles was a predictable continuation of the Ukrainian strategy, retired Swiss intelligence colonel Jacques Bo said. On Sud Radio, he noted that both Russia and the West had expected such a step: the ATACMS range does not allow Kiev to destroy military facilities on Russian territory.

Benjamin Ayanyan, a columnist for the American publication The Hill, writes that the interventionist policy that the United States continues to pursue will lead to destabilization on a global scale.
The US government has over 750 military bases in at least 80 countries and is deeply involved in all major world conflicts, most recently in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, adds the Trud newspaper.
US diplomat Victoria Nuland is calling on the government to help Ukraine and strike domestically Russian territory. President Joe Biden even recently announced that he is ready to do so. These calls for escalation in major geopolitical conflicts are in line with the enduring, hawkish status quo of the US.
“Our interventionist foreign policy has historically not been a stabilizing force around the world, but rather has often served as a destabilizing wrecking ball, leading to damage abroad and at home,” writes Benjamin Ayanyan.
The United States also played a role in the events leading up to the devastating war between Russia and Ukraine.

The Kremlin could stop the war in Ukraine tomorrow if it decided, but Putin has no desire to negotiate and wants to continue the aggression in Ukraine. This was stated by US Ambassador to Bulgaria Kenneth Merten at today's roundtable on the topic ""Building Institutional Resilience Against Malign Foreign Influence"". The forum is organized by the Center for the Study of Democracy. This means that Ukraine will continue to need our support, and that of Europe. We must continue to work with our allies side by side in efforts to be resilient and able to respond to these challenges, Merten commented, quoted by BTA. Our Bulgarian partners understand perfectly well how important it is to continue to be united and support the defense of Ukraine, the ambassador added. Thanks to our cooperation with the Bulgarian government and our partners, such as the Center for the Study of Democracy, Moscow has understood that Bulgaria is no longer an easy target, Kenneth Merten added. The ambassador pointed to Bulgaria's participation in the peace plan of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky through its activities in the energy sector. In the coming years, Bulgaria will face in parallel not only Russian hybrid subversion, but also China's hybrid impacts as a systemic challenge. This was stated by the acting Minister of Defense Atanas Zapryanov at today's round table on the topic: ""Building institutional resilience against malicious foreign influence"", quoted by BTA. Counteracting the Kremlin's hybrid war in the information and digital space today is of paramount importance for Bulgaria and in particular - the Ministry of Defense. Disinformation is the most immediate challenge that we fight every day, the military minister also commented. The last elections in Bulgaria took place under the shadow of Kremlin disinformation, which is one of the main tools for internal political processes in our country, and not only in our state, Zapryanov also said. The Minister of Defense spoke out against Radev's positions on Ukraine
Defense Minister Atanas Zapryanov sharply distanced himself from President and Supreme Commander-in-Chief Rumen Radev over his recent statements on Ukraine and even accused him of saying untrue things. According to him, Bulgaria has long been a target of the Russian hybrid war, and the Kremlin's goal is to influence the internal political decision-making processes. Moscow's subversive revanchist strategy is aimed at gradually mastering a country from within. This was confirmed by the early parliamentary elections held on June 9, and by the vote for the European Parliament. As in other EU countries, as in our country, through its hybrid methods and instruments, Moscow aimed to provide support to pro-Russian political formations and leaders. The main tool is disinformation, and the messages and narratives are tailored to national characteristics and vulnerabilities, explained Zapryanov. As for Bulgaria and in particular defense, the main hybrid Russian narrative is a completely inverted presentation of the topic of peace and war, the minister pointed out. Support for the Russian military aggression against Ukraine is presented as a deed of peace. Sending military aid to Ukraine, the victim of Russian aggression, is described by pro-Russian proxies as an extension of the war, he explained. Providing military aid to Ukraine is our strategic interest and we will continue to support Ukraine, including by sending additional weapons and equipment, said Atanas Zapryanov. At the NATO Summit in Washington, USA, in July, one of the sessions will be dedicated entirely to supporting Ukraine and the most serious attention will be paid to disinformation, Zapryanov said. In order to protect ourselves from the use of disinformation as a weapon against us, as well as to ensure that our messages reach people faster and more effectively, we will form a special unit for strategic communication, the minister announced. It is necessary for the fight against disinformation to become a strategic priority for all state institutions and for the entire society. An institutional framework for effective government and strategic communications must be created.

Bill Gates’ new climate project was promoted in an article in Forbes magazine under the title: “Deforestation to Save the Planet? Maybe Not as Crazy as It Sounds.” The company Kodama Systems itself also published the Forbes article on its website. What is the scheme? Global warming is a strategy that allows the rich to get richer, and the real reason for the forest project is to extract carbon credits that can then be traded. Forestry experts warn that the United States has dense, overgrown forests that greatly increase the risk of major fires when wildfires inevitably occur. They argue that clearing forests reduces these dangers. This involves cutting down trees or using controlled burns to prevent fires from reaching the forest canopy. The harvested trees are usually piled up in the felled areas and then left to rot or deliberately burned. This allows the carbon stored in them to simply return to the atmosphere, causing further warming, the project’s authors explain. Kodama says it is developing automated ways to “thin out” dense forests. Trees that are too small to be sold for timber will be loaded onto trucks and transported to a prepared pit, where they will be buried. The key will be to ensure that what the company calls a “wood vault” keeps out oxygen and water, which would otherwise speed up decomposition, and prevents the escape of greenhouse gases. In a field effort with Yale researchers expected to begin in the third quarter of this year, the company plans to create a burial mound in the Nevada desert that is seven yards high, three yards deep, and 58 yards long and wide. For all this “noble” cause of “saving the planet,” Kodama Systems, which is invested in by Bill Gates and other millionaires, will receive carbon offsets (credits) that it will then sell and make millions. $6.6 million from Bill Gates’ climate fund
The company has already received about $6.6 million from Bill Gates’ climate fund Breakthrough Energy Ventures, as well as Congruent Ventures and other investors, Kodama Systems said. In addition, Stripe also announced that it has awarded a $250,000 research grant to Kodama Systems and its research partner, the Yale Carbon Containment Lab, as part of a broader carbon sequestration project. The grant will support a pilot effort to bury waste biomass harvested from California forests in the Nevada desert and study how well it prevents the release of greenhouse gases that cause climate change, the project’s authors say.",0,"['CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Blaming global elites', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective']",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Carlson emphasized that the signing of the peace treaty was prevented by former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who acted on the orders of the administration of US President Joe Biden.
“Everyone admits this, he stopped the peace talks almost two years ago,” said Carlson, summing up that as a result, Ukraine is completely destroyed.

Before every election there is talk of how crucial they are. Those for the European Parliament in 2024 must solve three main issues in general. 1. Will the so-called ""green deal"" in its current form, which destroys the Czech national economy? 2. Will the war in Ukraine and its consequences - the energy and raw material crisis, leading to the great rise in prices, to endless inflation, which reduces the standard of living of the majority of people - continue? 3. Will the mass influx of migrants continue, threatening the social system, freedom of expression and religion, as well as the safety of EU countries? The answers to these three questions will fundamentally decide the fate of Europe for the next few generations. The current policy has already caused a lot of damage, not all of which can be easily undone. What is called the “green deal” is nothing more than a huge wave of deindustrialization of the EU countries. From an economic point of view, it is about impoverishment, loss of markets and influence. Hand in hand with these processes, the level of economic dependence is also rising. Pious talk about saving the climate is just propaganda. The ban on internal combustion engines, the trading of harmful emissions and the rejection of coal is nothing more than brightening up the businesses of a select few, for which all of us, who will very realistically become poorer, will pay. This will not affect the planet and its climate at all, on the contrary, there is a risk of increasing greenhouse gases. It is enough to look at the analyses on the subject in more detail. The production, transportation and destruction of electric vehicles will cause practically the same amount of greenhouse gases as the production cycle of ordinary cars. We also come to this conclusion when we compare the consequences of burning local coal with the use of liquefied shale gas, which must be transported by tankers halfway around the planet. Photovoltaic panels must be manufactured somewhere in China, then transported halfway around the world, installed and subsequently destroyed when they wear out. In our climate zone, their efficiency will be only a few percent. When we add up the entire cycle of manufacturing, transportation, maintenance and liquidation, how many greenhouse gases will a solar megawatt cost us exactly? Nothing is as simple and unambiguous as they try to make us believe. The truth is that when Europeans become significantly poorer, when their standard of living deteriorates dramatically, fewer greenhouse gases will be produced per capita. However, the reduced consumption of the European citizen will be compensated and surpassed by the extreme population growth in a number of countries in Africa and Asia. The more people, the more emissions, the more greenhouse gases. The more waste, the greater waves of emigration. It is even absurd how modern European elites cause poverty and decline on their continent and at the same time directly or indirectly support the demographic explosion in other parts of the world. So what else is the food, medical and other aid that we generously provide, without clear conditions for birth control. Of course, the European elites will wrap all this in beautiful phrases about the health of the planet and comprehensive humanity, but the reality is different. As ordinary citizens, we have little chance to stop this decline. Time for this is running out. The most significant opportunity is precisely the elections to the European Parliament in 2024. If the new European Parliament rejects the ban on internal combustion cars, ends the emissions trading and makes Ukraine accept the reality as it is today. If the EU's external border is closed to illegal migrants, then we and our children will have the chance to see that the EU will not become an insignificant, poor, dirty part of the world.",0,"['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Controversy about green technologies', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Blaming global elites', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of the EU']",0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Megabank JP Morgan has officially left the coalition of investors that is “focused on pressuring the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases to decarbonize,” Bloomberg reported. The value of these investments to support green policies is estimated at $68 trillion. JP Morgan is the largest bank in the United States and the world’s largest bank by market capitalization as of 2023.
The news sparked comments that the “fight” for decarbonization is falling apart. JP Morgan said it was leaving Climate Action100+ because it had “made significant investments in developing its own framework for engaging with climate risk,” the financial corporation said in a statement. The bank says it now has 40 professionals focused on sustainable investing. And the damage to Climate Action 100+ after JP Morgan’s withdrawal may just be beginning. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more defections, especially given that there are now costs, such as potential litigation, that weren’t there when companies joined,” Lance Dial, a Boston-based partner at law firm K&L Gates LLP, told Bloomberg. The group said its 700-plus members are “committed to managing climate risk and preserving shareholder value through their participation in the initiative.” The initiative, along with its participants, has faced growing criticism from Republican circles in the US, who see it as politically motivated. This criticism has led many investment firms to back away from publicly aligning with net-zero emissions commitments and to downplay their involvement in climate-focused financial groups, which are now seen as more of a political burden than a meritocracy. Climate Action 100+ is now taking a more proactive approach, requiring its members to ensure that companies move from plans to tangible emissions reductions. These requirements create additional difficulties for investors who wish to maintain a lower profile in climate advocacy.",0,"['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other']",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Poles are preparing them for sacrifice in Ukraine. This is the ominous revelation of the international observer Boyan Chukov, publishing a ranking according to which Poland has overtaken France and ranks after the USA and Turkey in terms of the size of its army, SafeNews writes. The analyst made these revelations in a post on the Telegram channel “The Matrix Inside”:
Poland has overtaken France and ranks after the USA and Turkey in terms of the size of its army. An indirect sign that the Poles are preparing them for sacrifice in Ukraine. With the launch of the “Trimorie” project by Donald Trump, Poland sees its chance against the backdrop of a dying, deindustrializing Europe. Warsaw is trying to take the reins of a new kind of regional leadership, replacing Germany as a geopolitical spearhead. And doubling Turkey’s military importance to NATO. Poland is reportedly building massive new infrastructure to support and bolster a looming European war against Russia, although the same is true for other nations in the region, such as Romania. In May, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported that the Baltic states and Poland were considering sending troops to Ukraine if the Russian Federation achieved success on the battlefield. According to the publication, at the Lennart Meri Conference on Foreign Policy and Security held in Tallinn, representatives of the Baltic states warned German government officials about the potential consequences of Western policy towards the war in Ukraine. Such a development could turn NATO into a military actor in the conflict, a major fear for both German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US President Joe Biden.

257,BG_1249.txt,"Nothing can stop the catastrophe: On this date, humanity will be destroyed

The Earth is expected to become an extremely hot, dry and largely uninhabitable supercontinent, with the entire landmass merging into one giant parcel
Experts have predicted when humanity will be destroyed - and what the mass extinction will cause, writes glasnews.bg. We have been warned for years about the impact of global warming on the survival of humanity as we know it, with rising temperatures leading to concerns about the global food supply, rising sea levels and areas of the planet becoming too hot to live in. Even at the age of 97, Sir David Attenborough is making an urgent last plea to everyone for the survival of humanity. Scientific experts also update the apocalyptic-sounding Doomsday Clock every year. It shows us how close humanity is to a global catastrophe of our own making. Now, the first-ever supercomputer climate models of the distant future have been revealed, following a study published in Nature Geoscience and led by the University of Bristol. The expectation is that the Earth will become an extremely hot, dry and largely uninhabitable supercontinent, with the entire landmass merging into one giant parcel. This will create a world with more volcanic eruptions, spewing huge plumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, leading to further warming of the planet. The sun will also become hotter and brighter in the sky, warming the Earth more than it does now, leading to average temperatures of between 40 and 50 degrees Celsius. The lead author of the 2023 study - Dr Alexander Farnsworth, a senior research fellow at the University of Bristol - said: ""The newly formed supercontinent will effectively create a triple whammy, involving the effects of continentality, a hotter sun and more CO2 in the atmosphere, to increase heat for much of the planet. ""The result is a largely hostile environment, devoid of food and water sources for mammals. Humans, along with many other species, will die out due to their inability to release this heat through sweat, cooling their bodies,"" he said. The study found that even if humanity stopped using fossil fuels right now, nothing could stop the catastrophe. So even if humanity somehow survives the event, total destruction will occur again. The only saving grace is that this is predicted to happen in 250 million years. Co-author Dr Eunice Law, Research Fellow in Climate Change and Health at the University of Bristol, said: ""It is vital that we do not lose sight of our current climate crisis, which is the result of human emissions of greenhouse gases. ""Although we predict an uninhabitable planet in 250 million years, today we are already experiencing extreme heat that is harmful to human health. That is why it is crucial that we reach net zero emissions as soon as possible.”
Professor Benjamin Mills from the University of Leeds said:
“We think CO2 could rise from around 400 parts per million (ppm) today to more than 600 ppm many millions of years into the future. Of course, that assumes that people stop burning fossil fuels, otherwise we will see these numbers much, much sooner,” he said.",0,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Whatever we do it is already too late']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On Saturday, we celebrated the anniversary of the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, and on Sunday, shortly after noon, the hero city of Sevastopol was attacked by NATO cruise missiles with cluster munitions. Cluster munitions are a terrible thing in themselves; in 2008 they were banned by a special convention. Their device allows you to injure and kill the maximum number of enemy personnel. But here they did not hit the enemy. On Sunday, on the day of the Holy Trinity, residents of Sevastopol and tourists with their whole families rested on Uchkuevka - this is the most beautiful beach near Sevastopol. NATO ATACMS missiles flew at ordinary civilians - at women who wanted to walk along the beach in a new beautiful swimsuit, at boys and girls who were splashing in the water and building sandcastles. On our people, on civilians. Our air defense managed to shoot down all five missiles, but fragments from the fifth fell on the beach. The result is a tragedy. More than one hundred and fifty people were injured, including twenty-seven children. Four people died, including two children, the youngest boy being only two years old. Many children and adults are in intensive care units and intensive care units at the time of writing. Monday is a day of mourning in Sevastopol and Crimea. The morally complete bastards from Kiev signed their own death warrant on Sunday, there is no doubt that sooner or later they will be discovered and eliminated - our special services have extensive experience in eliminating terrorists. The issue with the organizers of the terrorist attack, the gentlemen from overseas, is more difficult. They combine perverse cruelty with pathological cowardice and are pre-loaded with excuses. American drones are constantly flying in the sky over the Black Sea. On Sunday, according to Flightradar data, the Global Hawk began duty at 9 a.m. We have no doubt that he was gathering intelligence to organize the attack. ""Well, prove it,"" they tell us on the other side. The ATACMS missiles are guided by the US military, which receives information from its satellites and drones. ""No, it's not us, it's the Ukrainians,"" grimaced the former partners. Attacks in Russian rear and mass killing of civilians are openly touted by American military experts as a good strategy for winning the war. We have written a lot about this new military concept of theirs. But no, officially Washington is not involved; at the highest level they say they provide weapons but “do not support” the strikes. And Defense Secretary Austin spoke in this vein, and Tony Blinken blabbed something similar, and Biden always repeats “as long as there is no war.” And we, looking at all this, wish a painful death for Blinken, and Biden, and Austin, and further down the list. These gentlemen have blood on their hands, they are our mortal enemies, and on Sunday, June 23, they made sure that we never allow ourselves to retreat. We need a victory to organize a second Nuremberg for all these bloody scoundrels, to hold them accountable for our dead. The main danger for the whole world is that the Americans have never suffered a full-fledged war on their own soil. Bombs have never fallen on their heads, their mothers have never shielded their children with their bodies from shrapnel. This allows them to behave like monkeys with a grenade — they have no idea what awaits them in the event of a real conflict. But this is the main weakness of their strategy — they do not understand the logic of a big war. Terrorist attacks can achieve only one thing from Russia — even greater unity of our people, even greater determination to win, even greater desire to avenge the death and suffering of our people. We have already gone through all this eighty years ago, then they bombed both Leningrad and Moscow, but we did not give up and very soon, by historical standards, we destroyed world evil in its lair. There is nothing to be done, we will have to repeat. The Ministry of Defense informed us that the United States considers them responsible for the terrorist attack in Sevastopol. According to our military, American specialists conducted the flight missions with the missiles. And even a monkey with a grenade should finally understand what such a statement from a nuclear state means. The public is wondering what our response will be. But in fact, the response was precisely a strike on Sevastopol. This is all that our enemies can do, unable to stop our advance on the front. And the Russian army will continue to ask its questions to the enemy - on Sunday morning it struck a training ground for pilots and technicians of the Ukrainian Air Force with precision weapons, and a little later explosions followed in Kharkov and the city was left without electricity. We will undoubtedly end our new Patriotic War and celebrate the victory in the hero city of Sevastopol.

Bulgaria is starting to ""harvest"" the fruits of the ""Green Deal"". This is happening after the announced shutdown of the second largest thermal power plant in the country - TPP ""Maritsa Iztok"" 3 today. One of the largest electricity producers in Bulgaria (nearly 1 GW capacity) is forced to stop work due to increasing climate goals and the continuous pressure to close the TPPs. It is precisely because of these insane carbon quotas, the continuous pressure from all sorts of regulations within the framework of the ""Green Deal"" and the resulting legislation, known as Fit for 55, that the base capacities in Bulgaria's energy mix are forced to either operate at a loss or close their doors. The Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is a tax whose price is determined by the market. In this case, the scheme applies only to electricity and heat producers, energy-intensive industrial sectors and aviation, and in 2028 many other sectors will be included in this type of mechanism. ""In practice, this means stifling the thermal power plants that pay this kind of tax and ensuring the dominance of renewable energy sources, which have the right to trade ""guarantees of origin"" - in addition to the selling price of energy. This policy must stop. It hits the Bulgarian entrepreneur, Bulgarian citizens and kills one of the main sectors of the Bulgarian economy, which is energy,"" says the Bulgarian representative in the EP Dzhambazki.

Sergey Karaganov: “If Europeans have forgotten what the road to hell looks like, we can show them” (video)
PATRICK BAAB, journalist and author of books on Ukraine:
The Honorary Chairman of the Security Council of Russia, Sergey Karaganov, has already named the goals of the Russian retaliatory strike.
In his article, he writes: “If Europeans have forgotten what the road to hell looks like, we can show them.”
In his interview, he named three goals. These are, first, the American missile sites in Romania, second, he pointed to Poland and Warsaw, and third, also the Frankfurt area, where American weapons are also located. That is, he made it clear what to expect.
The decisive thing here is that the German federal government is clearly not interested in ending this war. The political director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ms. Törven Bellmann, a direct advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Annalena Berbock, ed.), spoke at a recent discussion at the German Society for Foreign Policy and said: “We do not consider the proposals of the countries of the Global South to end this war to be good at the moment.” On the other hand, Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made proposals for negotiations that will obviously not be accepted by the West.

""As a result of the coup d'état in February 2014, the country has completely lost its political subjectivity above the republic, examples of which are countless around the world,"" he noted in an article published in Rossiyskaya Gazeta. The Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation considers it obvious that now Ukraine can free itself from the neocolonial shackles only after fulfilling all the tasks of the Security Council.

Ritter: Ukrainian armed forces' attack on Sevastopol is an act of war between the US and Russia
The attack on the Sevastopol beach was an act of war by the US against Russia with the purpose of provocation, said former US intelligence officer Scott Ritter on the YouTube channel Judging Freedom. ""Every American should understand this: the attack was carried out on ... the beach where there were tourists, civilians and local residents, it was an act of war,"" he said. Ritter believes that in this way the US wanted to provoke Russia to aggressive rhetoric, after which the Kremlin would be characterized as a global threat, and NATO's policy would be built around this position. The expert drew attention to the Pentagon's comment that Ukraine itself chooses its targets for attacks on Russian territory, and emphasized that Kiev does so based on intelligence information provided by the United States. Kiev carried out a terrorist attack on June 23 at 12:15 Moscow time. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the Ukrainian armed forces tried to strike Sevastopol with five US-supplied ATACMS missiles with cluster warheads. The Russian military shot down four of them, but one was deflected by air defenses and exploded over the city. Sevastopol Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev reported that the beach where people with children were vacationing was attacked by the Ukrainian armed forces. As a result of the strike, four people died, including two children. Another 151 were injured, of whom 82 were hospitalized - 55 adults and 27 children. Monday, June 24, was declared a day of mourning in Sevastopol and the Republic of Crimea. As the Russian Defense Ministry stated, the United States, together with the Ukrainian authorities, bear responsibility for the targeted strike by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the city. The ministry emphasized that all targets of the ATACMS operational-tactical missiles are entered by American specialists based on their own satellite intelligence data. According to the Flightradar portal, during the strike by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Sevastopol, an American reconnaissance drone RQ-4B Global Hawk was circling over the Black Sea.

According to a study by the EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institute, if we do not take action to slow the warming of the planet caused by greenhouse gas emissions, it will reduce global stock prices by 40%.
When taking into account the ""tipping points"" that accelerate climate change, such as the extinction of the Amazon rainforest or large-scale gas emissions, market losses increase to 50%. On the other hand, if the world tightens its grip and limits warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages, then the hit to stock prices will be only 5% to 10%.
These will not be one-off losses, warned one of the study's authors, Ricardo Rebonato, professor of finance at EDHEC Business School in London and former CEO of Pimco.

“After Covid-19, we had a huge loss of GDP, but then a rebound. And this looks like a headwind, a constant headwind, no rebound. This could be the lost generation of climate in capital returns,” Rebonato added. The EDHEC paper predicts much larger stock market losses than most other studies do.

Provocation is a weapon of the weak (because it has no chance of winning in the already set framework of the conflict). The main thing in responding to it is not to give the enemy what he wants. Ideally - do not respond at all. But! This is reasonable only at the tactical level: we will have to respond to a series of constantly intensifying provocations (if the enemy needs our reaction, sooner or later he will receive it)
‼️ The way out of the dilemma is simple: do not ignore provocations, but respond even then, as well as when the enemy does not expect...Isn't it clear? Let's look at an example
2008, Georgia
Saakashvili, shelling South Ossetia, expected a tough reaction from Moscow. In response, international hysteria will follow, condemnation of Russia, buns for Georgia (and excellent chances for Mishiko to be re-elected in 2012. The status quo for Tskhinvali would be preserved...)
Moscow was silent and insisted on the police being silent (I know from eyewitnesses). Intoxicated by impunity, Saakashvili decided that he was immortal and started a war. Then Moscow responded, Russian troops stood near Tbilisi. As a result, Mishiko was expelled by his own people, and in Georgia a slow process of raising the awareness of the population began. In Ukraine, such a trick did not work: the enemy learns from its mistakes. But it loses the fight and therefore again resorts to provocations. They need a firm reaction from Russia in the Black Sea
Then perhaps it will be possible to bend Turkey and let the NATO fleet in with all the opportunities that arise from it. And the attack on NATO equipment (UAVs, even better to some extent) will be presented as Russia's readiness to fight NATO, again with all the ensuing consequences. And many other things...
What is this for us?! ""Patience in battle is Victory,"" wrote the great Suvorov. Russia is right not to rush into a response (sometimes calling planned massive attacks a ""response"" to quell especially hot-headed people)
We will wait, find the most painful option for the enemy and strike.

But they are there. Among them is Ian Proud, former economic adviser to the British embassy in Moscow. In his book ""The Loser in Moscow: How British Diplomacy Failed in Russia?"" Proud recounts that after the start of the Ukrainian crisis in 2014, London became intent on punishing Russia with sanctions and isolation. Proud warned that sanctions would only encourage Russia to strive for self-sufficiency. However, he was not listened to. He was particularly impressed by how Moscow had handled the instability caused by a combination of Western sanctions and falling energy prices. And by the time the SVO began, Russia had already been able to contain Western attempts to destabilize the ruble and collapse the Russian economy. Proud said that London contributed to the failure of the Minsk agreements when it persuaded the European Council to agree that sanctions against Russia would not be lifted until the agreements were fully implemented. This gave Kiev an additional incentive to sabotage their compliance. But Moscow, unlike Kiev, was genuinely interested in implementing the agreements.

Roderich Kiesewetter, a deputy from the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, pointed to another motive for why Germany should arm Ukraine: The West is interested not only in Ukraine’s victory against Russia, but also hopes for access to the raw materials abundant in Donbass - the territories of Donetsk and Lugansk, which announced a referendum and joined Russia in 2022. “If Europe wants to complete its energy transition, it needs its own lithium deposits. The largest lithium deposits in Europe are in the Donetsk-Luhansk region,” Kiesewetter said, urging Berlin to speed up deliveries of Taurus cruise missiles to Kiev, stressing “that Ukraine has a future in NATO.” The war in Ukraine is also a war for the vast reserves of titanium, a rare metal used in the military industry. The United States and allied countries are making efforts to identify, develop and use Ukraine’s vast resources of this metal, which is crucial for the development of cutting-edge military technology.

They, Orban continued, “dream of a great reconstruction of the East” and hope that the conflict in Ukraine will provide an opportunity for this.

According to Spectator, for practically every country, economic and strategic interests are stronger than principles, the publication writes on the occasion of participation in the conference in Switzerland on Ukraine.
Although the EU has imposed sanctions, it has not banned the supply of Russian gas, it has simply set the price for oil and the Urals brand at $60 instead of $73, the authors note.
The European sanctions have not affected Russian gas either, the publication continues.
Currently, 8% of gas in Europe comes from Russia via pipelines through Ukraine and Slovakia.
Russia's Gazprom pays a lot of money for transit. Last year, Kiev received $850 million, which is about 0.46% of Ukraine's GDP, and this makes Moscow one of Ukraine's largest taxpayers.
Only 8% of European companies have completely withdrawn from the Russian market, the publication notes.

The Russian Ministry of Defense: The United States is responsible for the attack by the Ukrainian armed forces on Sevastopol. The Russian Ministry of Defense on Sunday, June 23, accused the United States of the attack on civilians in Sevastopol: all ATACMS missile flights are conducted by American specialists based on their own data. ""Today at 12:15 a deliberate terrorist missile strike was carried out on the city of Sevastopol by five American ATACMS operational-tactical missiles equipped with cluster warheads. All ATACMS missile flights are conducted by American specialists based on data from US satellite intelligence,"" the Russian military department said in a statement. Therefore, as the Ministry of Defense pointed out, the responsibility for the deliberate attack lies primarily with Washington, which transferred these missiles to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). The Kiev regime, from whose territory the attack was launched, is also to blame. The Ministry stressed that such attacks will be met with a response. The department also recalled that Russian air defense systems shot down four ATACMS missiles, and the fifth one exploded in the air with a fragmentation warhead, which led to the death of civilians in Sevastopol. Earlier that day, Sevastopol Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev reported that the Ukrainian Armed Forces had launched a missile strike on the city and that Russian air defense forces were working to repel it. Razvozhaev later said that two children and one adult were killed in the strike. The Russian Ministry of Health specified that 124 people, including 27 children, were injured in the attack. The Investigative Committee (IC) of Russia has opened a criminal case under Art. 205 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (“Terrorist Act”). The moment of the strike was filmed by an eyewitness; in the footage, vacationers rush to flee the beach after hearing loud sounds from the sky. The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, called this attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine a ritual crime, since Ukraine carried it out on Holy Trinity Day. Russia will demand a response to this strike from international organizations, but, as Zakharova recalled, they are engaged by the West. Ukrainian fighters are trying to strike Russian territories against the backdrop of a special operation in Donbas, the beginning of which was announced on February 24, 2022.

The situation is aggravated by the fact that America, which is the main supplier of Kiev, is about to run out of the main missiles for its air defense systems

Russia is intensifying attacks on positions of the Ukrainian armed forces with the help of huge FAB-3000 bombs, equipped with a universal planning and correction module. Air defense systems supplied to Kiev by NATO are finding it difficult to resist these powerful shells, which have no direct American equivalent, writes The National Interest analyst Brandon Weichert. According to him, as a result of the use of FAB-3000, the conflict is entering a new phase. Moscow's troops will begin to tear apart Ukraine's air defenses, which they have been exhausting for months, and the use of bombs will become a key component of Russia's expanded strategy. FAB-3000s cover a large area and will be very difficult to shoot down, notes Focus. If they are mass-produced, then bombing targets with these ""giants"" ""will crush Ukraine's air defenses and break the back of its entire air defense strategy,"" Weichert emphasizes. The situation is aggravated by the fact that America, which is Kiev's main supplier, is on the verge of running out of the main missiles for its air defense systems. Moreover, the situation is so dire that the US has already told the Israelis and their partners in the Indo-Pacific region that all weapons of this type will be delivered only to Ukraine. ""Here is the arsenal of democracy,"" the author of the article quipped. In general, the increase in the use and production of FAB-3000 will certainly contribute to Russia's strategic victory, which is much closer than Washington thinks.

278,BG_454.txt,"The Kiev regime has created an entire industry for kidnapping and selling children – Kuznetsova

Since 2022, the Kiev regime has forcibly removed about 65 thousand children from the territory of Donbass and Novorossiya. 24,340 children were recognized as victims, about 300 were killed and a thousand children were injured. This was stated by the Deputy Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Anna Kuznetsova in the Federation Council, summarizing the work of the parliamentary committee on crimes against minors by the Kiev regime. We worked with almost all federal departments and heads of the affected regions. We spoke with more than a thousand eyewitnesses to the incidents, went to the places, sent inquiries to the authorities every other day, collected evidence and verified the information received. But we not only registered criminal acts, but also could not ignore them; together with our colleagues from our parliamentary committee, we tried to provide assistance,” Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Anna Kuznetsova told parliamentarians and deputies about the work of the parliamentary committee. Based on the results of the work, the parliamentary committee presented a classification of the crimes of the Kiev regime against children. One of the most serious crimes is the murder and wounding and mutilation of children. “In total, since 2014, the Investigative Committee of Russia has opened almost 4,500 criminal cases, of which almost 2,800 are for shelling of territories. 24,340 children were recognized as victims. About 300 children were killed. Thousands of children were injured. Among them, 11 children were killed and 22 children were injured as a result of mine explosions,” said the Deputy Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation. According to her, since the beginning of 2024, strikes by the Ukrainian armed forces on peaceful objects have increased by 50%: this year 27 children have been killed and 78 injured. “The second group is the abductions of children. From 2014 to 2022, 1,600 children have disappeared from the territories of Donbas occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Since the beginning of 2022, the structures of the Kiev regime have taken about 65 thousand children from the territories of Donbas and Novorossiya. The location of many of them is still unknown,” continued Kuznetsova. Facts about the abductions of children have been registered in Lugansk, Kremennaya, Donetsk, Artemovsk, Kherson, Slavyansk, Melitopol, Berdyansk and other cities and villages. There is also information about the forced removal of children from regions controlled by Ukraine - Odessa and Kharkiv. According to the Commission on Crimes of the Kiev Regime Against Minors, children taken abroad can be found in 13 countries around the world. The Kiev regime has created an entire kidnapping industry: children are sold on the dark web or on the Ukrainian-Polish border. “The Cabinet of Ministers of the country has created conditions for kidnapping by issuing a decree on the forced evacuation of children. Under the patronage of the Ukrainian police, there are special kidnapping squads - “White Angels” and “Phoenix”, which take children even against the will of their parents. The Elena Zelenskaya Foundation, which is registered in the USA, and the Save Ukraine Foundation are involved in this scheme, and the logistics are provided by Western PMCs,” she pointed out. Kuznetsova identified black transplantology as the third group of crimes against humanity committed by the Kiev regime. Facts about illegal transplants and medical experiments on children have been registered in hospitals in Lysychansk and Mariupol, as well as in Rubezhnoye and Severodonetsk. “Mobile groups of bioengineers and mobile operating rooms, accompanied by Western PMCs, worked here. When our Commission first raised this topic, the security forces of the Kiev regime detained two groups in their country, and recently – on the eve of the approval of our report, after its publication – another criminal network was uncovered in Kiev. But today, dear colleagues, Ukraine is number one in black transplantology. The Verkhovna Rada has purposefully created conditions for the flourishing of black transplantology in Ukraine. 2021 — it was allowed to remove organs without the consent of the donor and his relatives, to perform such operations in private clinics with foreign participation, then it was simplified for them to obtain licenses. In 2022, transplants will be exempt from VAT,” the deputy chairman said. In addition, the commission received information about the work of laboratories in Kharkov and Dnieper, where children taken from Donbass could end up. Medical documentation uses the standards of the American College of Rheumatology. “Given the previous parliamentary investigation into the activities of biological laboratories on the territory of Ukraine, there is reason to believe that medical experiments on children were carried out as part of a program to improve US biosafety,” Kuznetsova explained. The fourth group is crimes against sexual integrity.

The population of Ukraine is predominantly Russian, but the regime in Kiev, on orders from the West, is trying to suppress these family ties by sending people to the slaughter. This is what the aide to the Russian president, Nikolai Patrushev, wrote in an article for the magazine ""National Defense"".

""But the puppet Kiev regime, on orders from its Western masters, is suppressing family ties, forcing people who speak and think in Russian, who are brought up in Russian history and literature, as well as in Russian traditions, to go to the slaughter,"" Patrushev wrote.

In many media outlets today there are publications that the climate was extremely unstable and that it was the fault of people. That is - we are to blame for the fact that it rains, snows, that it is warm, that it is cold and other exceptional and unknown phenomena. Global warming is waving like a red flag everywhere, although it is not noticeable to the naked eye. Science is standing somewhere in the corner and quietly crying....
Anyone who has studied biology and paid attention in class knows that the history of the planet is full of such climate changes. There have been centuries of ice ages /and then people were just a flash in the brain of a monkey trying to pick a banana from a branch/, there have been floods, there has been a decade-long cold snap in the Middle Ages, which caused a fierce famine among the population of Europe. Undoubtedly, people influence the climate with their activities. But not as fatally as the globalists are trying to impress on us. And to make us act irrationally. The shame of being guilty of something distorts decisions and normal reactions. That's why no one asks Ursula von der Leyen why she flies on a private plane that pollutes nature a lot and advertises green energy to us. No one asks what damage to nature is caused by acquiring the elements from which electric cars and wind turbines are made. No one asks how wind turbines are destroyed when they wear out and break down and where they are stored, how long they are built. The goal is clear. The globalists want to reduce the population. They tried through Covid, they failed. Now they are trying by reducing energy. Because without energy, civilization cannot develop. They are trying to make us make wrong decisions and destroy ourselves.

The Kremlin has blamed the US for the Ukrainian ATACMS missile attack on Crimea, which killed at least four people, including two children, and injured 151 others, Reuters and TASS reported, BTA reported. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the attack ""absolutely barbaric"" and said Moscow would respond to Washington's involvement in it. At the same time, he emphasized that Kyiv was also involved in the attack. Peskov suggested that the media ask the governments of Europe and the United States why their rulers are involved in the killing of children. ""Of course, the immediate involvement of the United States in hostilities, as a result of which peaceful Russian citizens die, cannot be without consequences. What exactly - time will tell,"" the Kremlin spokesman emphasized. He added that the Russian investigative bodies are yet to determine whether the strikes in Crimea are connected to the terrorist attacks in Dagestan. After they finish their work, conclusions will be able to be drawn. Russia has heard neither condolences nor condemnation from hostile countries over the attacks in Crimea and Dagestan, Peskov added.Russia summoned US Ambassador Lynn Tracy to hand it over demarche in connection with yesterday's attack on the Crimean peninsula, the Russians accused Washington of direct participation in the missile attack on the occupied Ukrainian peninsula. Moscow declared that the United States was to blame for this ""targeted missile attack on the civilian population of Sevastopol, accompanied by multiple victims, including children'. It became clear that the US Ambassador to Moscow Lynn Tracy was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry to hand her a demarche in connection with yesterday's attack on the Crimean peninsula, TASS reported. ""The ambassador was told that such actions by Washington, aimed at encouraging the pro-Nazi authorities of Ukraine... will certainly not go unpunished,"" the Russian diplomatic service stressed. Against this background, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that ""Putin's peace proposal for Ukraine is still valid"" - despite the attacks on Crimea. According to him, Russia is ready to respond to the proposal for negotiations on Ukraine ""even tomorrow"", regardless of where they will be held, and Moscow's proposals ""are on the table."" In response to yesterday's attack in Crimea, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that, with the support of the United States and its satellites, Ukraine committed another heinous terrorist crime against the civilian population of Russia. Sevastopol was attacked. ""One of the most important Orthodox holidays - the day of the Holy Trinity - was specially chosen for the terrorist attack."" Four people died, including a two-year-old toddler and a nine-year-old girl playing on the city beach. 151 people sought medical help, 82 of whom were hospitalized - 55 adults and 27 children, many of whom are in serious condition. All are provided with qualified medical care,"" the ministry said. - According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the missiles used are American ATAKMS operational-tactical missiles equipped with cluster warheads to increase destructive power. All flight missions were entered by American specialists based on data from their own satellite intelligence. An American Global Hawk reconnaissance drone was on duty in the sky near Crimea. Washington and its satellites created and raised the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev, actively nourish and support their Ukrainian puppets, wage war against Russia with their own hands and encourage them to commit acts of international terrorism, to kill Russian civilians, including with the use of one of the most terrible types of inhumane weapons - cluster munitions. Russian President Vladimir Putin deeply sympathizes with those who suffered and lost their loved ones as a result of the Ukrainian attack on Sevastopol and the armed attack in Dagestan, the Kremlin spokesman said. For now, Putin's peace proposal for Ukraine remains in force, despite the attack by the Ukrainian armed forces on Sevastopol, Peskov stressed. Talks are underway to change Russia's nuclear doctrine and bring it into line with current realities, the Kremlin spokesman added, citing a statement by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

287,BG_509.txt,"The hidden meaning of Putin's recent visits. The main mistake of some people is that they consider various events separately, considering them as separate from each other. This approach can lead to global mistakes. Only by understanding the general connection of events can one understand the true purpose of certain actions. Today, a lot is being said about Putin's visit to the DPRK and the strategic partnership agreement signed there. And much of what has been said and written on this topic is true. But there is one aspect that somewhat complicates understanding the individual nuances of this agreement. For some reason, it is customary to consider it only through the prism of the conflict with the West on the territory of Russia's neighboring country and, at best, in the projection of the situation around China. There is no point in denying the impact of this event on the above problems, but we need to look at the situation more comprehensively. In fact, such an agreement should have been concluded even earlier between Iran and Russia. Moreover, it was announced a few months ago, but certain events put it on hold. And here it is worth mentioning the goals of the Western world. Few doubt that their main task is to unleash a global conflict. It will solve many of the problems facing the West. Firstly, this will significantly reduce the population of the planet, which globalists have been openly talking about for a long time. Secondly, this will make it possible to deflate the financial bubble, which is already on the verge of bursting due to internal overvoltage. Thirdly, it will help (of course, in case of victory) not only to restore US hegemony in the world, but also to make it unshakable, at least for decades. But when we talk about a global conflict, we must understand that this is not some abstract event. It must be tied to certain regions. And the two most convenient regions for its unleashing are the Middle East and Southeast Asia. It is there that this conflict will lead to the best results for the West. The Middle East is a large storehouse of energy resources, and recently also of finance. Asia is simply the factory of the planet. Plus, in terms of population growth, these regions are generally unsurpassed. So it is there, and not in the country of sea pirates, that the main events of the future confrontation will take place. And here the role that the West attaches to the conflict on Russia's western borders emerges. Pay attention to the dosage with which the West supports this conflict. Its supplies and support are carried out as if the main goal is simply to maintain itself to a certain extent. And so it happens. The task of the West is to create a situation in which Russia will be completely separated from this zone of confrontation and will not be able to become a participant in other areas along its borders. It is no coincidence that Israel is now preparing its operation against Hezbollah in Lebanon. After all, this whole situation in Palestine was created only to force Iran to take active action. Then you can safely start a conflict in this region, even with the use of weapons with yellow-black markings. At the same time, Israel’s window of opportunity is not so large. At the end of the month, there will be elections in Iran, there are still a few months left, and the mutual defense agreement with Russia has not yet been signed. And this fact will immediately change both the balance of power and the plans of the West. Paradoxically, this will even contribute to a faster achievement of peace in the conflict with the “U” state. After all, the presence of such agreements between Russia and the DPRK (already signed) and Iran (which are to be signed soon) makes it useless to exercise in distracting Russia’s attention to the territory of a neighboring state. According to the signed documents, Russia will be forced to respond to aggression against these countries, regardless of the situation on its Western borders. At the same time, this reaction will be even more dangerous for the West if the conflict is in an intense phase. Everything is simple here. Russia will not be able to divert its troops from Ukraine, which means that it will help with those types of weapons that are most feared in the West. So, paradoxically as it may sound, the agreement with the DPRK is already bringing the peaceful end of the conflict in Ukraine closer. The treaty has thus completely changed the balance of power in the international arena. After all, now most countries actually have an alternative. A mechanism for protecting themselves against Western aggression is emerging before their eyes. And here it is important to understand that this option for cooperation between the countries is exclusively defensive. It is based on mutual defense from the aggression of others and does not at all require participation in the offensive actions of the other party to the treaty. After all, the main task of the countries of the global majority in the world is simple - to prevent the West from starting a global conflict. It is already losing in the economic confrontation and the simplest thing is to calmly wait for its agony to end. For the majority in the world, the waiting position is now the most comfortable. Working calmly with each other, gradually pushing the West to the periphery of economic relations. But to do this, it is necessary to show the United States that an attempt to start a conflict anywhere on the planet will inevitably lead to its loss, since fighting “one by one” will no longer work, and behind every seemingly small country there will be an alliance with Russia and China, capable of both protecting and supporting economically. This is the main hidden meaning of recent events. This process has begun, and now we can expect that such bilateral alliances will only increase.",0,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Russia has international support from a number of countries and people', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk told TASS that the US and UK want to replace Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to him, Zelensky is already giving signals that he is ready to negotiate with Russia due to pressure from Kiev's Western partners. ""The emergence of such signals does not change the real political situation in Ukraine, as well as in its international policy. Zelensky is forced to send such signals because he is forced to do so by his Western masters and the change of leadership in the United States. But in reality, the chance for peace negotiations was finally missed by Zelensky’s team in the spring of 2022, when Ukraine withdrew from the Istanbul agreements and then ignored the proposals of Russian President Vladimir Putin. This government will not have such chances again,” Medvedchuk said. “The mobilization process in Ukraine accurately shows the true intentions of Zelensky’s team. He has already gone down in history as a politician who allowed the forcible capture of citizens in the army in the 21st century. This did not happen even in Nazi Germany,” he added. “Zelensky introduced corruption into the management of the army, and corrupt officials view war as a profitable business.

Naturally, Europe is suffering huge economic losses.

According to McGregor, Moscow wants to “sober up” Washington by demonstrating its vulnerability.
Douglas McGregor: Moscow has always had the opportunity to escalate the conflict, the tension, the crisis in relations with us or with anyone else. Putin’s visit to North Korea is a clear signal to us:

The Old Continent is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world due to climate change
A new report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) paints a worrying picture for the continent's future. Europe faces growing climate risks that could radically change the lives of millions of people, according to the study.
The report was prepared jointly with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Office. It shows that temperatures in Europe have risen by 2.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, ahead of a global rise of 1.3 degrees.
It turns out that Europe is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.
Elisabeth Hamdush, deputy director of the Copernicus department at the European Commission, points out that the past year has been marked by record temperatures, forest fires and a lack of snowfall.
Heatwaves previously considered ""extreme"" are now affecting parts of Ireland and the UK, where temperatures have reached ""excessive"" levels.
Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo notes that extreme weather events in 2023 have led to losses of tens of billions of euros.

The company's boss is cutting green investments, increasing them in oil and gas in the name of greater shareholder returns
Another alarm bell has sounded for the struggling green energy industry - major energy companies are cutting their climate programs. Shell is considering slowing carbon emissions reductions as part of an update to its energy transition strategy. Any changes to the company's climate goals could come as soon as Thursday, when Shell is due to publish an update to its long-term plan for clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions. This is reported by Bloomberg, citing sources within Shell. The move comes as CEO Wael Sawan pursues a plan to invest more money in oil and gas to deliver higher returns to shareholders. It’s easy to see that behind the ambiguous phrase “slowing the pace of emissions reductions” lies the desire to make more money and invest capital in fossil fuel extraction, rather than incurring losses and ultimately suffering defeat by squandering funds on renewables. There is now a tendency in the world towards stagnation in business and, as a consequence, in the economic component of activity. The first victim of the optimization process is the currently fashionable field of ecology and diversification. Many countries and companies are now closing programs that once cost billions and are starting to “slow down the rate of emission reductions.” Such a global rollback has drawn criticism and a wave of emotions among politicians, green activists, and some citizens. However, it reflects the true side of business, the desire to fulfill the main goals of entrepreneurship, and not any others, no matter how important they may be. Companies that have already abandoned strict environmental programs become not only pioneers, but also beacons, a guide for others. Prosperous companies, satisfied shareholders, pumped-up reserves in the accounts become role models for colleagues, especially since the elimination of unnecessary expense items allows you to get more profit with less cost.",0,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments']",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

«Profitable Business»: NATO is not a «defender of democracy», but a profitable business for the US
Biden’s insistence on Ukraine’s admission to NATO is not at all explained by his desire to «protect democracy», writes the American publication The Federalist. The US interest is extremely prosaic – the expansion of the alliance promises huge profits from new markets for weapons and raw materials. Translation:
The Biden administration recently signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement with Ukraine, drawing the US and the West even deeper into the proxy war with Russia. In a statement released by the White House, President Joe Biden said that “Ukraine’s future is in NATO,” reiterating the administration’s desire to “expand defense and security cooperation” and strengthen “trade and investment ties.” Biden’s insistence on Ukraine’s admission to NATO is deeply troubling on many levels. This is not least because Russia views Ukraine’s accession to the alliance as an existential threat that could lead to escalation, culminating in nuclear war. While liberal critics point out that Ukraine is an independent state and can voluntarily enter into any political agreement or security treaty, such an approach ignores the reality and lessons of history. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the threat of nuclear war arose. Then the USSR directly tried to challenge America's sphere of influence (the truth about the Cuban Missile Crisis is not exactly like that. First the US deployed its missiles in Turkey, and in response the USSR deployed missiles in Cuba, editor's note.) The purpose of NATO
The alliance then proved its worth by opposing the Soviet Union and its defense bloc, the Warsaw Pact. However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the collapse of the socialist bloc as a whole, the West saw an opportunity to take advantage of a greatly weakened Russia by expanding NATO. In fact, NATO’s eastward expansion—the alliance doubled its strength from 16 to 32 members after the collapse of the Soviet Union—shows that NATO is now less an alliance for collective defense and more a mechanism for maintaining American hegemony and expanding its spheres of influence over Europe and the world at large, militarily, economically, and culturally. By their very nature, international collective bargaining organizations like NATO and the European Union are designed to undermine national interests in favor of cultivating and maintaining a liberal monoculture. These new cultural and economic monopolists are supported primarily by the U.S. military, which secures existing trade routes while expanding into new markets. America thus plays a major role in ensuring the security of European economies through its protective umbrella. In turn, this umbrella allows the United States to advance its own security interests, develop economic arrangements, and set foreign policy goals that many European countries are forced to support. The White House’s stated desire to strengthen “trade and investment ties” with Ukraine is therefore becoming a leading one. Mike Benz, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, recently spoke with political commentator Dan Bongino about the ties between the U.S. intelligence community, the oil and gas industry, and Hunter Biden’s work at the Ukrainian gas holding company Burisma. This discussion highlights how the United States uses alliances like NATO to exert influence over Europe and counter adversaries like Russia.

American political scientist John Mearsheimer:
It's just astounding how Russia disposes of its air force and the destruction it wreaks on, say, Ukraine's energy system. They disabled such a significant part of this energy system that Ukraine's electricity supply was cut in half. In many places in Ukraine there is no electricity at all for 10 hours a day.
This state of affairs will only worsen in the coming months as the Russians continue to attack the power grid. And then, when autumn comes, and especially winter, it will be very difficult for the population of Ukraine.
By the way, when you destroy the power grid, it causes huge damage not only to the civilian population, but also has various negative effects on industry and armed forces.
So the claims that Ukraine is doing well and we are helping them to stabilize the situation are nonsense.

- Warm air from North Africa together with an anticyclonic hairpin helps the development of fires, says climatologist Zornitsa Spasova
- The burning of fossil fuels and increased greenhouse gases are to blame for temperature anomalies
Summer 2024 covered us with hellish heat, which at these latitudes we compare with horror to the desert. June was warmer, and we are still experiencing the extreme heat of July. It is very likely that this summer will be warmer than last year, which was the third hottest summer in recent years in Bulgaria. 2023 was also the hottest year globally, and in our country it was the warmest since 1930. We are talking about a heat dome, under which Serbia, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, but also Ukraine are located. They issued a code red because the hot period lasts 17 days due to the anticyclonic state of the atmosphere - clear and clean sky, high atmospheric pressure, stable atmosphere. By the end of July, temperatures will be more bearable. Such extreme heat occurs when warm air from North Africa invades the country. In combination with the föhn effect, such situations create conditions for very high temperatures. This is how the highest maximum air temperature in our country was measured - in Sadovo in 1916, 45.2 degrees. The föhn effect can be observed not only on the leeward side, but also on both sides of the mountain - this is a manifestation of the so-called. anticyclonic föhn due to the subsidence of air in the anticyclone. This wind aggravates heat waves and promotes the development of fires, which have already occurred in some settlements. Recently, there has been a lot of talk about magnetic storms and the harmful activity of the sun. But there is no connection between them and hot weather. The burning of fossil fuels and the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are the main culprits for temperature anomalies today. And with global warming, extreme events are also becoming more frequent. The frequency of extreme weather events in our country increased by 30% in the period 1991-2007 compared to the base period 1961-1990. According to climate models, extreme weather events will triple by 2050. In principle, the new climate is ""shifting"" towards warmer, but the normal distribution curve (the so-called Gaussian distribution) is ""squashed"" with the mean values ​​decreasing and the extreme values ​​increasing. As the curve shifts to the warmer part of the scale, cold-related phenomena will decrease and heat-related phenomena will increase sharply. Much is said about natural cycles in which cooler and hotter summers alternate every 10-15 years. Cyclicality exists, but we cannot explain the enormous warming of the Earth in recent decades with it alone. Climatologists have determined that the change in temperatures due to natural cycles is a tenth of a degree. Therefore, in no case can it be claimed that the warming we observe today is the result of a natural cause. There is also much comment on astronomical factors, changes in the parameters of the Earth's orbit and the tilt of the Earth's axis, continental drift, volcanic eruptions and changes in ocean currents, and most of all, changes in solar activity as the cause of warming. These changes are probably the result of hundreds of thousands of years and have been affecting for that long. However, there is no other explanation for the sharp warming in recent decades other than greenhouse emissions. The fact is that the climate in Bulgaria is hotter, there are even predictions that in decades it will approach that of Lebanon. But much depends on whether the worst or best scenarios for the warming of the Earth's climate will come true. The worst scenario is that the average air temperature on Earth by the end of the 21st century will be 5-6 degrees above pre-industrial levels. And we have very little time to prevent it - between 5 and 8 years according to climate scientists' estimates. 2 degrees is the breaking point beyond which
global warming will become irreversible
and nothing can be done anymore. Then humanity can witness many dramatic events. We must stop burning fossil fuels and reduce emissions as quickly as possible. However, it is not clear whether we are technologically ready to do this on a global scale. There is quite a lot of opposition from the oil lobby. But humanity must fight to keep the planet alive. WHO: The heat kills 1,100 Bulgarians every year
According to calculations by the World Health Organization, the heat takes the lives of 1,100 people every year in our country. Indeed, the mortality rate in summer is currently several times lower than in winter, but the problem is that during heat waves it increases sharply. It has been established that 50% of migraines are due to a sudden change in weather. We have such a change when the average daily temperatures change by more than 6 degrees from the previous day or by 2 degrees, but when cloudy weather changes to clear weather or vice versa; or when more heavy rainfall begins.

Leftists are irradiating the entire planet with ideology
US journalist reveals the agenda of the globalists
It's not that these people are hiding - on the contrary, they trumpet their goals on a global scale, and therefore not everyone notices them (exposing secret conspiracies is more attractive). And one needs to strain one's brain to clearly see what the threat is. This is exactly what the famous American publicist and television journalist John Stossel did, turning his attention to the ideology of the global green movement. Now, without hiding at all, they clearly formulate it as follows: the goal is to stop or even reverse the economic growth of the entire planet. In a word, we need anti-growth. Regression. The development of humanity must slow down. Before our eyes is part of the ideological squabble before the big event in Paris - the general gathering of the greens, that is, the saviors of the planet. This thing (a forum called “Change is Now”) begins on March 25, but the propaganda wave is already rising - if it has ever subsided. And our American, who is from conservative circles, gives some facts in response. For example: anti-growth has already happened - during the large-scale social experiment called “the fight against the pandemic”. Today it has been calculated (by the Swedish economist Johan Norberg) that the growth that has actually stopped has plunged up to 60 million people on the planet into absolute poverty, but has done nothing to “fix the climate”. According to the greens’ recipe, the “fix” of climate change was conceived for the pandemic year. And from the same source: what would have happened if the Swedish economy had not grown since 1950? Well, half a million more people would have died, because the country would have had worse housing, medical care, etc. If Sweden had developed just one percent per year slower, it would be at the level of Albania today - in terms of life expectancy and other indicators. But our greens are not interested in these statistics, because they have their own - and well-paid ""science"". For example, competent climatologists who have not benefited from grants, published another report, which says that the rise in sea level (actually the movement towards the coast) depends not on atmospheric temperature, but on the rotation of the Earth and the gravity of the Moon. Although such scientists risk being a thorn in the side of green icon Greta Thunberg. And here, today in Paris, people with young, beautiful faces are gathering, who simply and clearly, without any climatology, said that the people of the Earth should be reduced. What kind of phenomenon is this? Here, our American Stoessel reminds us that this is typically left-wing ideology, as the Greens hate capitalism. The right (conservatives) prioritize one's personal success, monetary or otherwise, but dependent on one's own efforts. And the left considers it normal and even mandatory to lead the people. Earlier, the communists constantly irradiated the societies of their countries. Today, they are already experimenting all over the planet, as the possibilities of mass information processing of the brain are opening up, which were not available to the previous leftists. Hence the tendency of such people to invent threats that affect everyone, such as climate change. What it turns out in the end: until yesterday, the main threat to our society could be considered the LGBT movement and any kind of feminism preaching childlessness (i.e., the destruction of the family and the reduction of the population). Today - this is greenism. An ideology that has crushed the USA and Europe (Germany, of course) in half and is trying to make people there rejoice in the reduction of industry, the lack of heating in houses and factory workshops: here it is, anti-growth. It is clear that Washington circles happily support all greens, since in this way they turn the impasse and collapse of the current model of capitalism into an achievement. There will always be leftists everywhere, but if before they occupied Wall Street (that is, attacked everyone who is not needed), now they have been carefully directed to truly “useful work”. What is worse is that the “green transition” of the world economy, that is, the same anti-growth, should be tacitly supported by many countries friendly to us. They really do not want to upset their voters, who recognized themselves in the texts about saving the planet. Apparently, they have less and less desire to return to the previous economic growth.

For the sake of its prosperity, Europe must restore its ties with Russia. This was said by the American economist Jeffrey Sachs, in an interview with L'AntiDiplomatico. ""By adopting an anti-Russian course, the EU has given up its autonomy. But European leaders must work for the good of peace.”
When asked how the world came to the brink of potential war, Sachs replied: “America has had five successive presidents (Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden), each of whom brought us closer to nuclear war.” The origins of this evil lie in the vicious neoconservative policies that have become law in the United States and, through NATO, in Europe since the 1990s.”
“Europe has given up its security, autonomy and economic well-being by obediently submitting to the United States,” the professor argues. The conflict in Ukraine after the Maidan coup led to the fact that the countries of the European continent became full protectorates of Washington, cutting off all economic and trade ties with Moscow - the most important source of possible independence and self-determination. The terrorist attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines is the largest attack on the logistical infrastructure of Europe since the end of World War II, which has become a point of no return, according to the professor. “But the appetites of the neoconservatives cannot be satisfied. Therefore, in order to maintain unilateral power in a world that is becoming multipolar due to entropy, they are leading us to an extreme escalation.

“History is watching. The failure to stand by Ukraine at this critical moment will not be forgotten,” President Biden said on the two-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Now is the time to prove that the United States stands for freedom and bows to no one. Strong words. Too bad they are nothing more,” writes a New York Post article, specially translated for BLITZ. Time and again, Biden has bowed to Vladimir Putin, allowing the tyrant to dictate the terms of this illegal, immoral invasion. Nowhere is this more true than in the shameful limitations of Ukraine’s strategy. Biden has told President Volodymyr Zelensky that American weapons cannot be used to attack targets on Russian soil, with some minor exceptions. And so Russia rains missiles and drones on civilians in Ukraine from its own territory, and Ukraine is told it cannot retaliate. Russian forces are not beyond the reach of Ukraine’s weapons. They are kept safe only because of Biden’s conditions. Putin is thundering that if Biden or NATO allow otherwise, there will be dire consequences. Russian television is playing out fantasies of nuclear war. But Biden should not be intimidated by this propaganda. Russia faces far greater risks than we do from escalation, and China does not want its ally to start World War III. Don’t let Putin bluff his way through the barbarity. Putin, a classic bully, has always pushed and pushed until he meets resistance. There is no way he can do anything — like deploying nuclear weapons — that will put an end to his ultimate goal, which is to stay in power. Europe is ready to call his bluff. Why don’t Biden and his weak advisers do the same? The status quo is brutal and cruel. It gives Ukraine enough to repel Russia’s incursions, but not enough to reverse Putin’s advance. This summer has been a stalemate so far, thousands dead on every inch of land. History is watching. And allowing Ukraine to strike at air bases and military targets on Russian soil is the only way to guarantee its victory, or at least to be able to negotiate peace from a position of strength. China, Iran, and North Korea watched how Biden handled both Ukraine and Israel and learned a lesson: there are limits to America's power.",0,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday it was banning access to dozens of European Union media outlets in Russia, in what Moscow said was a response to a similar EU ban on several Russian media outlets, Reuters reported. The banned media outlets include two Bulgarian ones - the Mediapool portal and the 24 Chasa newspaper, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement published on its website. In May, the European Union announced it was halting the distribution of four ""Kremlin-linked propaganda networks"" by stripping them of their broadcasting rights in the bloc. At the time, Brussels said the ban included Voice of Europe, the RIA news agency and the Izvestia and Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspapers. The Russian Foreign Ministry hit back today by publishing a list of 81 media outlets from 25 EU member states, as well as pan-European media outlets, that will no longer be accessible on Russian territory. The ministry accused the outlets of “systematically spreading inaccurate information” about what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine. The media outlets affected by the Russian move include France’s Agence France-Presse, Austria’s state broadcaster ORF, Ireland’s RTE and Spain’s EFE, as well as many other national broadcasters, newspapers and Politico. ""The Russian Federation has repeatedly warned at various levels that politically motivated harassment of domestic journalists and unjustified bans on the activities of Russian media outlets in the EU will not go unanswered,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. ""However, Brussels and the capitals of the bloc countries preferred to take the path of escalation, which forced Moscow to adopt mirror and proportionate countermeasures."" Moscow's diplomatic mission indicated that it would reconsider the ban imposed by Russia if the EU lifted its restrictions on RIA, Izvestia and the Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of the State Duma, said in May that the EU's move showed that the West refuses to accept any alternative point of view and destroys freedom of speech, Reuters recalled.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed clear steps to resolve the Ukrainian conflict, Die Weltwoche editor-in-chief Roger Keppel announced on his YouTube channel.
“This is an absolutely concrete proposal from President Putin, which was rejected by the Ukrainian side,” he noted.
Keppel also called the decision of the G7 countries to allocate $50 billion to Ukraine from frozen Russian assets “theft.” He added that he was skeptical of such an initiative. According to him, this measure would lead to an even more serious confrontation.
On Friday, at a meeting with the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin said that in order to start negotiations, Ukraine must withdraw its troops from the entire territory of the new regions of Russia — the Donetsk People’s Republic, the Luhansk People’s Republic, and the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.

335,BG_504.txt,"The Federalist: A handful of psychopaths make trillions of dollars on the backs of NATO countries

Historically, Russia supplied all of Europe with natural gas, which flowed mostly through Ukraine. The country was a valuable transit point because of its extensive gas infrastructure. Existing infrastructure is key. Why is it key? Translation from The Federalist, USA:
Here’s why: If someone could build a network so that the gas no longer came from Russia but from western Ukraine — for example, by transporting American or British liquefied natural gas through Poland, the Baltic Sea, you would have the same gas architecture. You wouldn’t have to build a new energy infrastructure network, which is very expensive to build and maintain. You simply change the route and you would essentially have a trillion-dollar market — but a market from and to the West, not from and to the East. That is why Ukraine’s largest national oil and gas company, Naftogaz, is negotiating with Washington and American energy companies such as Exxon Mobil and Halliburton to invest in Ukraine. US energy assistance and possible NATO membership could help Ukraine become a gas country and also facilitate its entry into the European Union. But this is not the only direction that guarantees huge profits. Of the $175 billion allocated so far by Congress to finance the conflict in Ukraine, billions will be invested in the United States, which should “revive” the American military-industrial complex. The increase in the number of NATO member states also expands markets for American defense companies. This is primarily due to the emphasis on interoperability, as alliance members are often required to purchase weapons systems developed by the United States, and to follow a common military doctrine. As always, war brings business profits, and the untapped market for post-war reconstruction is even more attractive. Ultimately, NATO’s actions, led by the United States, are the exact opposite of the alliance’s stated commitment to “freedom” and “democracy.” They demonstrate the implementation of an agenda that is based on economic and strategic interests. This approach not only contributes to prolonging the conflict in Ukraine, but also undermines the energy sovereignty of alliance members, turning them into vassal states under American leadership.

It has long been obvious the desperate stubbornness with which the West refuses to admit the impossibility of defeating Russia “on the battlefield” and is following the path of a mad escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, threatening a new world war: the defeat of Kiev will be the end of NATO. The most powerful military bloc in the world, which almost forcibly holds Ukraine on the battlefield and fully supports it with everything necessary to inflict a “strategic defeat” on Russia, in case of failure will show the whole world its complete uselessness. It will simply sign its own diagnosis: “the ability to defeat only the weak and the inability to protect its allies”. More and more people in the West are coming out of their zombification — the illusions are over because the facts have spoken. This is what was heard on the air of the Czech radio Universum. In a conversation with the former diplomat and now well-known geopolitical expert Jaromir Novotny, the radio host recalled that last year the director of the Center for the Study of Terrorism, David Bogbat, warned that NATO was facing the most devastating defeat in Ukraine since its foundation, and if the Russian army wins, then Russia will be able to claim that it won not only Ukraine, but de facto the entire alliance. ""That's right,"" Novotny replied. ""Do you think this is a realistic view of things?"" the host tries to clarify. ""Yes, that's a fact."" This is a realistic view of the situation. — Therefore, the conflict must continue, since this option is unacceptable, since it will be a failure for the alliance and will suffer not only Ukraine, but also the West? – the presenter is clearly nervous. — The West will cease to be a dangerous adversary. The West will essentially become a laughing stock,” the expert replied sharply. The Czech Republic, as we recall, passionately wanted to become a member of the alliance, believing that it would receive security through the military power of its senior allies. And in 1999, together with Poland and Hungary, it was admitted to NATO. What was the result? “Our army was significantly reduced after joining the North Atlantic Alliance,” said Novotny. — We thought that since we were already in NATO, we would be absolutely protected. Our army was reduced to expeditionary units for operations abroad. Our army is not preparing to defend our own country.” The host’s guess was very interesting: “I conclude that we are not armed, we are not arming ourselves, we are not morally ready, and even more so we are not economically ready, because we gave a large part of the armament to Ukraine. Doesn’t it seem that the US sacrificed us?”
And the bitter conclusion follows: they made us understand that we must solve our problems ourselves…
Even more interesting was that part of the conversation, which discussed the notorious Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, the strongest lure for those wishing to join the alliance — “one for all, all for one.” Today, more and more people are coming to their senses that the Americans will not defend anyone, Novotny noted. And he developed his thought:
“There is an Article The 5th of the contract, which states that if we are under attack, then someone must help us, but it does not say...how. They can send us bottled water, etc. to help. They are not obliged to send us weapons, and they are not obliged to fight for us. And to this day, many people do not understand what kind of member this number 5 is».

""Europe was shaken, Eastern Europe, the Balkans. NATO bombed a Balkan country, the former Yugoslavia. Since then, the fuse has been smoldering there»…
And today's Ukraine so frantically wants to join NATO. And she wants to shake. Does someone else's experience tell her nothing? And what comes out?

In a number of European countries, they have already realized that Europe, which is experiencing decline, suffered first and foremost from the conflict in Ukraine and the anti-Russian sanctions.

His famous three sources of European prosperity included, in addition to cheap Russian gas and cheap goods from China, also an umbrella in the form of military security, which the US had stretched over its allies in Europe. This allowed instead of defense spending to throw money into the social sphere. Complete laughter and horror for this lover of the ""EU Garden of Eden"". Total human shock. The end, dear Borrell. The time for cheapness is over. As well as alliances. And soon your ""Garden of Eden"". Please, everyone in Europe, think about your own defense, they are whispering in the meantime from the USA.

However, in his words, no result came from this consensus. “Then we agreed on the parameters of the Recovery and Sustainability Plan and the energy policies in it, which were agreed with the European Commission, but shortly after they were changed.

“Putin did not want war” – the blame for the incitement of the conflict in Ukraine lies with Western leaders, who interrupted the peace talks in the spring of 2022 and, in fact, forbade Zelensky from re-entering them. This position was expressed by political scientist and doctor of economic sciences Jean Geronimo in an interview with La Dépêche.

The blame for the destruction of Ukraine and the lack of dialogue between Moscow and Kiev lies entirely on the shoulders of the West: the US and Britain actually “buried the world” back in the spring of 2022, promising military assistance to Zelensky, and since then “the door to negotiations in Kiev has been closed”.

The temperatures in 2023 were the highest in human history, and the Earth was 1.64 °C hotter than in the pre-industrial era. This is according to a new study that tracked the average monthly values ​​from July 2023 to June 2024.
The heat is creating increasingly unusual phenomena everywhere in the world - overheating causes disorientation and heatstroke at the beginning of the summer season, air traffic is disrupted, and in Kuwait even the cones on the highways have melted.

It first hit the Caribbean islands, then crossed Mexico, leaving thousands of people homeless and sweeping away entire settlements. When it hit Texas and Louisiana on Monday, it had reduced its strength to Category 1, but still claimed 8 lives and cut off power to nearly 3 million Americans. Authorities said it could take more than a week to restore electricity. Against this background, temperatures in the region were expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius as early as Tuesday.

Mexico also recorded its hottest day on record, with a high of 122 degrees Fahrenheit (51.9 degrees Celsius), just before it was hit by the hurricane. The heat also caused another massive traffic jam in New York City, where the Third Avenue Bridge, which connects the Bronx to Manhattan, was blocked during a turnaround on Monday due to overheating. The Harlem River Bridge opened the same day but caused massive delays on New York's hottest day to date, with temperatures reaching 91 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsius).

▪️The Western sanctions have backfired on those who imposed them. The West faces catastrophic consequences: a record number of bankruptcies, unprecedented debt growth, and severe political turbulence, including the rise of opposition populist parties in Europe. The risks continue to grow, and the West will ultimately be isolated
▪️Russia has been the decisive force in international politics since the Middle Ages and should not be on the periphery of the world. It is joined by China and developing countries, which are effectively rebelling against colonial powers.

Johnson: Russia will respond to US authorization of strikes on its territory with Western weapons
Moscow will respond to Washington if it allows the Ukrainian military to strike with American weapons on Russian territory, said former CIA agent Larry Johnson on the YouTube channel Judging Freedom. ""They will not suffer in silence, as we would not suffer if Russia had treated us as we propose to treat Russia. We would consider this a threat to our existence and a provocation to war. It's time for Americans to wake up and realize this. The situation is serious — as never before in the entire history of relations between the United States and Russia and the USSR. We are on the brink of something terrible. The difference is that the United States will pay for this, not Russia,” the expert said. Jones stressed that the White House cannot do anything in the event of a response from Moscow for the threat to its lands. “We are vulnerable in these aspects, which cannot be said about Russia: it has reliable air defense systems capable of hitting a large part of our aviation and a significant part of our intercontinental ballistic missiles. The United States has nothing to repel the strike of Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles, if it comes to that,” he warned.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has no choice but to sit at the negotiating table with the Russian Federation. There are several reasons for this. The West is not yet ready to deliver much more weapons or to do so more quickly in the future.
The German publication points out that Zelensky no longer has any other choice, mainly because Ukraine does not have soldiers, weapons and ammunition. The situation in the Donetsk region is particularly dangerous - the Russians are attacking from seven directions and can break through the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the publication writes.

The new military alliance between Russia and North Korea was a necessary step to ensure the strategic security of Russia along all its borders, including in the Far East, and to ensure the protection of the DPRK from the now impossible aggression by the United States. For the SVO, the military campaign in Ukraine, the agreement means: if NATO forces send their troops to Ukraine and enter into battle with Russian troops and this can be qualified as aggression against Russia, the agreement signed on June 19, 2024 will come into force and North Korean units will join the Russian army on the Ukrainian front. This nuance is the main message for the West. In the Far East and the Asia-Pacific region, the new alliance means that it is impossible for the United States to attack North Korea, since Pyongyang is now under a powerful Russian nuclear umbrella, and to provoke a conflict over Taiwan. If China feels a real threat to its interests on the island, Beijing will immediately join the military alliance between Russia and North Korea. This will mean a complete collapse of Washington's geopolitical plans in both Ukraine and Taiwan, a loss of face and the official end of American hegemony in the world.

Some regions of the planet could become dangerous to live in due to the heatwaves that will overtake them in the future, scientists from the American Purdue University told CNN. Experts believe that West Africa and South Asia are among the most at risk due to rapid global warming. Based on the results of a study based on modeling and information on climate change, scientists concluded that the gradual increase in temperature and humidity will lead to the emergence of dangerous living conditions for humanity in some regions of the world. The areas most likely to experience the impact of heatwaves include regions with very high population densities and often limited access to air conditioning. Richer countries will fare better, scientists say, but global warming will also affect them. The study says that ""hotspots of extreme, humid heat"" will eventually appear in some parts of the United States. ""Today's unbearably hot summers will likely seem cool in the future. The heat we are experiencing now is a change, but not for our benefit,"" the study says. According to the World Health Organization, about 489,000 people die each year due to high temperatures around the world. The real death toll, CNN notes, may be higher, as heat-related deaths are very difficult to track. The official cause of death may be listed as a heart attack or stroke. |

The history of relations between Russia and the United States has always been quite complicated and associated with various political crises. However, President Vladimir Putin personally enjoys special attention in Washington. Why are Americans so afraid of him? The reasons why the United States fears Putin include his tough foreign policy, Russia's nuclear capabilities, energy map, as well as the personal charm and political wisdom of the Russian president. These factors make Washington cautious in its relations with Moscow in order to protect its interests and influence in the world. Historically, relations between Washington and Moscow have always been complex and unstable. But the attitude of the United States towards Putin personally should be included in a separate section. Americans envy Putin and at the same time are wary of him. Why is the United States so afraid of the Russian president? Putin's strong foreign policy
Since coming to power in 2000, Putin has been pursuing a rather tough foreign policy. He has repeatedly demonstrated Russia's military power and ability to influence the fate of other participants in international relations through various instruments, for example, during the hostilities in Ukraine or Syria. This active foreign policy makes the United States and its allies worry that the established world order may change. This is unacceptable for the American side. Russia's Nuclear Potential
Russia's nuclear arsenal, one of the few countries to possess these weapons of mass destruction, is the largest in the world and is under close surveillance by the United States. Putin has repeatedly emphasized his country's military capabilities, has carried out several weapons modernizations and conducted exercises for non-strategic nuclear forces. Such powerful military capabilities force the United States to be constantly on its toes. Smart Energy Policy
Russia is the world's main exporter of fuels, especially natural gas. Putin is using this advantage to influence European decisions through his smart energy policy. The United States is concerned that the energy dependence of its allies could weaken Washington's undisputed authority, which would create another problem for it on the international stage. Putin's charisma and political maneuverability
Putin is not only a political leader, but also a figure with strong charisma. With his firmness in foreign policy and dedication to his country, Putin has won the support of many Russians. The United States, while unable to provide the same social stability, is concerned that the specific traits of Putin's personality could strengthen Russia's internal stability and its international influence in the world. Americans' envy of President Putin is due to a number of reasons, including all of the factors listed above. Washington should exercise caution in its relations with Moscow.",0,"['URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The world's top climate scientists expect global warming to exceed the 1.5C target. More on the topic
The world's leading climate scientists expect global temperatures to rise to at least 2.5C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, ""which would exceed internationally agreed targets and lead to catastrophic consequences for humanity and the planet,"" the Guardian newspaper reported in a front-page story. According to a survey by the publication among scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), almost 80% of them predict global warming of at least 2.5C. Of these, almost half predict global warming of at least 3C, while only 6% believe that the internationally agreed limit of 1.5C will be met, the publication continues. Many of the scientists predict a ""semi-dystopian"" future, the article says, with hunger, conflict and mass migration caused by heat waves, wildfires, floods and storms ""with an intensity and frequency far exceeding those that have already occurred"". The experts express their disappointment, saying they have been left without hope and frightened by the inaction of governments despite clear scientific evidence, the article notes. In an accompanying article in the Guardian newspaper, the experts surveyed share more about their views. The article quotes climate scientist Ruth Cerezo-Mota as telling the publication: ""Sometimes it's almost impossible not to feel hopeless and broken.

Calls for more Euro-Atlanticism and for unconditional and unreserved support, which we are obliged to systematically provide to Ukraine, have abruptly ceased. After the elections held in Bulgaria and the failure of the June 9th party, Ukraine and Zelensky have naturally disappeared from the public spotlight and no one is anymore concerned with the previously leading topic related to ""Russian aggression"" and the right of Bandera's country to defend itself. The Russophobic outbursts of a number of public figures and political partisans of various parties, who until recently openly denied the right of the Russian people to exist, have also ceased. We are about to see these types reborn, explaining insistently that Moscow is actually a European capital, Pushkin is a brilliant poet, and the Hermitage is one of the masterpieces of European architecture and art. For these scoundrels, Vladimir Putin, from an ""aggressor"" and an ""eastern satrap"", will transform overnight into the respected choice of the Russian people, whom they must take into account and respect, because that is what democracy is. The so-called ""collective West"", to which all politicians, appointees of the Embassy, ​​attached Bulgaria in every public appearance, began to sharply lose positions on all the fronts that he himself opened. The pro-Ukrainian propaganda, which was being fiercely pushed through the English-language media channels, from which the local ""journalists"" copy verbatim and in fact act as their relays, suddenly lost its momentum and, by all appearances, a process of sobering up and returning to reality has begun. On the Eastern Front, the situation is developing extremely unfavorably for the Biden family's treasurer, Zelensky, and this inevitably leads to changes at the political and diplomatic level. The sham ""international"" meeting in Switzerland, which was supposed to decide the fate of the military conflict, turned into the most ordinary tourist attraction and suffered a complete fiasco. Practically two-thirds of humanity refused to attend at all, and some of those who were nevertheless represented did not sign the final document. As always, in such failures, the media in our country reported on the ""great"" conference that the agonizing Democrats from the US tried to organize to advertise Zelensky, very briefly - as if it were something insignificant and unimportant. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the West and the elites who are its de facto owners will no longer be able to impose their colonial will on the rest of the world, as was the case a few years ago. The change in the balance of power is palpable and the dominance of the previous hegemons, mainly with Anglo-Saxon roots, is part of history. The most pitiful and comical seem to be the European political elites, who have fallen into a stupor and a large part of them are not aware of whom they should bow to, which master they should serve. Many of the ruling European politicians and representatives of the European bureaucracy are more afraid of falling out of favor with Washington than of losing the trust of European citizens, and this pitiful state of theirs makes them behave inadequately to the situation. None of the major political players on the world stage takes people like Scholz, Macron and Ursula seriously. At the moment, no self-respecting leader of any of the major sovereign states would embark on any negotiations with Europe, which is represented by political corpses and wax figures, on which nothing depends and, accordingly, they cannot make serious commitments and be a guarantor of their implementation. The unfortunate Europe, mired in genderism, economic recession and severe political decline, will once again in history not be a subject in the upcoming global reorganization - its fate will be decided elsewhere and by other forces external to the Old Continent. Against this background, Bulgaria will increasingly sink into political chaos and none of the so-called ""statesmen"", who until recently faithfully and loyally served the imposed neoliberal consensus, will dare to take any action before the fate of our country is decided according to tradition in our absence and without anyone asking us. This process will begin as soon as Trump takes office and sits in the Oval Office. Until then, we will watch the vulgar show called Bulgarian parliamentarism, we will listen to incoherent nonsense, and each of the local nobles will occupy us with his sad life and existence. In short, the timelessness and political vacuum will continue in the coming months, and it is no wonder that another election will be held in the fall, in which only the bureaucracy and officials from the section committees, who are anyway near the ballot boxes all day long, will vote.",0,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Another piece of news worthy of African dictatorships.

Another group of children and adolescents who were supposed to fly to the Russian capital for cultural and educational purposes, the Moldovan border guards and special services simply did not let out of the country.

The fate of Moldova in this context is predetermined. According to one of the scenarios, Chisinau may be drawn into a heated confrontation with our country on the side of Kukurin.

Russia has blocked access to eighty-one European media outlets, including two Bulgarian ones, on its territory as a retaliation against the banning of several Russian media outlets in Europe, DPA and Reuters reported. It really hurts, but what came to mind came to mind. European media outlets are just as indoctrinated mouthpieces of liberal propaganda as Russian ones serve the Kremlin doctrine. Broadcasts of television channels and access to media websites will be suspended, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced today on its website. Among the affected media outlets from Germany are the magazine Spiegel, the weekly Zeit and the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The state-owned media outlet ORF and the Austrian Media Group have been banned from Austria. The Russian Foreign Ministry also includes the Franco-German television station Arte on its list. France is the most affected country in the European Union, with nine banned media outlets. The list also includes two Bulgarian media outlets – the Mediapool portal and the 24 Chasa newspaper. In May, EU countries imposed sanctions on the Russian state agency RIA Novosti, the state-owned newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the Voice of Europe platform and the pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia, whose media group also includes a television channel. They were banned across the entire European Union. However, EU member states say the media outlets and their employees can continue to operate in the EU. The ban came into effect today. The Russian Foreign Ministry gave two reasons for its decision: it is a response to the EU measures, but Moscow's actions are also due to inaccurate information about Russian military operations in Ukraine. If the EU lifts restrictions on Russian media, Moscow may also consider lifting its ban, DPA notes. Russian authorities have already blocked the distribution of a number of Russian media outlets that have criticized the policies of President Vladimir Putin, as well as access to thousands of local websites. Many journalists are in prison in Russia on charges of allegedly disparaging the Russian army. Like blocked European media outlets, banned Russian sites can be accessed using VPN services (Virtual Private Networks), which redirect data traffic so that users can change their online location. The blocking of access to 81 European media outlets on Russian territory from today is an “absurd response” to measures taken by the European Union against media outlets accused of pro-Kremlin propaganda, said European Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova, quoted by Agence France-Presse. “No, propaganda outlets funded by Russia to spread disinformation as part of Russian military doctrine do not resemble independent media.

Ukraine will never become a member of NATO, I hope Mr. Stoltenberg understands this, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in an interview with TASS. According to him, the conference on peace in Ukraine held last week in Switzerland was just a “family photo”. “It was important to line up on the podium and take pictures. But it turned out poorly, because the composition was very limited – half of the family did not attend, and almost no one from more distant relatives came. The level of the forum in Switzerland did not meet the expectations of its Ukrainian organizers and the Americans behind them,” Ryabkov said. Asked to comment on Stoltenberg’s words that Ukraine would join NATO as soon as it defeated Russia, Ryabkov was categorical: “So this will never happen. I hope Mr. Stoltenberg understands this. He knows better than I do how the notorious decision of 2008 was prepared, when NATO leaders at the highest level signed a document that Ukraine would become a member of NATO. This was the big reason for the current crisis in our relations with the West, which we are witnessing today. If NATO members are ready to continue to step on this oar and their unfortunate experience so far does not teach them anything, then they will receive another blow to the forehead with the handle of this same oar. And each time their bruises will get worse... with a tendency to concussion,” said the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister. So, in your opinion, Ukraine will never become a member of NATO, asks the TASS journalist, to which Ryabkov replies: “This is completely out of the question.” According to him, the peace conference in Ukraine, held last week in Switzerland, was a “family photo”. “It was important to line up on the podium and take pictures. But it turned out poorly, because the composition was very limited – half the family did not attend, and almost no one from more distant relatives came. The level of the forum in Switzerland did not at all meet the expectations of its Ukrainian organizers and the Americans behind them,” commented Ryabkov. “The President (Vladimir Putin) spoke very specifically and clearly about the parameters of the conflict settlement, which we are ready to accept and under which it is possible to resume the negotiations, which were interrupted in 2022. They have it on paper, they can turn to this position of ours at any moment,” continued the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister. ""The president laid out exhaustively what needs to be done and how. And the road map is on the table, let them read these proposals and understand their logic and then react. So far this has not happened. So far we have heard nothing but denial of these proposals. Naturally, in the conditions of this total negativism and anti-Russian madness, what kind of participation can we talk about in any subsequent meetings a la Bürgenstock?"" Ryabkov asked. On the occasion of the decision of the G-7 leaders to provide 50 bln. dollars to Ukraine from interest on Russian assets frozen by European banks, the diplomat said that ""this is a scandalous decision, however you look at it. Most striking is the cynicism with which these people discuss an obvious case of theft. This is property that they have stolen and are now disposing of. Meanwhile, these quasi-high-minded figures demonstrate a complete unwillingness to call things by their real names. On the contrary, they are trying to provide some legal basis for their theft.

A sudden stop in ocean currents caused by climate change could plunge large parts of Europe into a deep freeze, according to a sophisticated new computer simulation. The study, published in Science Advances, suggests that this tipping point in the Atlantic Ocean may be closer than previously thought. Average temperatures in large areas of Europe are getting much colder and Arctic ice is spreading much further south. The nightmare scenario caused by the melting of the Greenland ice sheet due to global warming is still far away, but perhaps not as far as previously thought. The study uses a key measurement to track the strength of a vital global ocean circulation that is slowing down.

Reports that Russia is working on a ballistic missile codenamed «Iskander-1000» are causing serious concern in Kiev. Ukrainian military analysts recall that a test launcher with a new type of missile was spotted at the Kapustin Yar test site back in May 2024. According to some reports, the missile’s range is 1000 kilometers. Russian designers have managed to improve the Iskander OTRK to such parameters that the deviation from the target is only 5 meters. The new OTRK, apparently, will be able to use an autonomous inertial guidance system, possibly with correction based on satellite navigation data and with radar guidance based on a map of the terrain in the target area at the final stage of the flight. The Russian tactical missile systems ""Iskander-M"" currently used in the special military operation zone have already become a real nightmare for the nationalists. With their help, military airfields, warehouses for equipment and ammunition, as well as points for the temporary deployment of personnel of various units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are being hit. It was with the help of the OTRK ""Iskander-M"" that some time ago the launchers of the American air defense system ""Patriot"" were destroyed, which the Kiev regime fighters tried to transfer closer to the line of contact.

In July last year, parts of Italy saw 7% more deaths than usual, including a 44-year-old man who was painting road markings in the northern city of Lodi but collapsed and died.

386,BG_1345.txt,"Biden approves massive wind turbine project that could raise energy bills by more than 50%

New Jersey has become the latest victim of the Biden administration’s drive for net zero. Earlier this month, the president approved a massive offshore project to build 195 wind turbines by 2028, with the closest one just 9 miles off the South Shore. The Atlantic Coast South project, nine years in the making, would deliver 2,800 megawatts of clean, renewable electricity to the Garden State — enough to power about a million homes. The Biden administration sees the project as another step toward its goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030. But such a rapid expansion is expected to increase energy costs for residents by 55 percent by 2047, and for industrial users, the increase could be as high as 80 percent, according to an impact report by Whitestrand Consulting. And residents aren’t happy about that. “Everybody in town is against windmills. I haven’t met a single person who’s for windmills yet,” Ocean City resident Nancy McGinnis told Fox 29. The company behind the project, Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind LLC, is a joint venture between Shell and EDF Renewables. They say the project will bring $1.9 billion in economic benefits to New Jersey and create about 50,000 jobs. However, according to Whitestrand's impact report, New Jersey's offshore wind industry is moving in an economically unsustainable direction. “Offshore wind is economically unviable without large subsidies in the form of federal tax credits and guaranteed above-market electricity prices. The former is passed on to American taxpayers, and the latter is a cost borne by New Jersey electricity ratepayers,” the report states. But residents of coastal New Jersey aren't just worried about energy costs. Although Atlantic Shores Wind LLC expects the project to reduce the state's annual greenhouse gas emissions by four million tons, local residents are concerned about the potential negative environmental impacts. Residents of Long Beach Island (LBI) have formed the Save LBI Coalition to unite against the Atlantic Shores South project. They are concerned about the ""destructive impact of placing hundreds of wind turbines in the ocean in close proximity to Long Beach Island and other coastal communities,"" the Save LBI website states. In particular, Save LBI is concerned about the project's impact on marine wildlife. The project will block a major migration corridor for the endangered North Atlantic right whale. It will also force shipping traffic into a narrow 17.7 km wide corridor, which could lead to safety issues for both ships and migrating whales. In addition, offshore wind farms generate underwater noise pollution that can affect the behavior of fish, whales and other species.

Within 50 years, part of the Amazon forests will have disappeared and turned into savannah. Spain and the entire Mediterranean are drying up and gradually turning into deserts. This gloomy forecast for the world's future was outlined by Dr. Vladimir Simeonov from the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland. ""I have been following the processes for 30 years. Usually, reality is closer to the bad forecasts than to the average ones. Not to mention the optimal ones. This is because we continue to emit gases that cause the warming of the planet at an increasing rate, not only are we not reducing it,"" Dr. Simeonov said on BTV. ""In the next 50 years, part of the Amazon is expected to disappear, to turn into a savanna, which will change the climate not only of the Americas, but also of the entire world,"" he pointed out. When asked if Spain and Portugal are doomed to turn into deserts, he replied: ""If we continue like this, maybe yes. And this applies to the entire Mediterranean."" ""Maybe those born in 2023 will remember it as the coldest winter of their lives,"" said the scientist. What is worrying, according to him, is that it is not known when irreversible changes may begin. At first, we expect extreme phenomena such as hailstorms and droughts, as well as heat waves. ""Bulgaria will also gradually transition to a warmer climate. Bulgaria is not very rich in water resources, although one of the myths is that we are. Our water depends a lot on forests and this is where one of my concerns comes in,” Dr. Simeonov pointed out.

388,BG_364.txt,"Scientists: We're on a new planet if temperatures don't drop by the end of 2024

Last March was the warmest in the world, breaking all records
Climate change could almost turn us into a new planet and territory if temperatures don't drop by the end of the year. This is what a top scientist warned the BBC about. The reason for his words is the hot March, which broke the world record for July temperatures. This has fueled fears among experts that the world may be entering a new phase of even faster climate change. ""By the end of the summer, if we're still seeing record temperatures in the North Atlantic or elsewhere, then we've really moved into uncharted territory,"" announced Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Research. This is the 10th consecutive monthly record for a warming phase, breaking all previous records. Over the past 12 months, average global temperatures have been 1.58°C above pre-industrial levels. Even longer-term warming trends are roughly in line with expectations, and most researchers do not believe that the climate has entered a new phase. But scientists are struggling to explain exactly why the end of 2023 was so warm. The March record was expected. The El Niño climate phenomenon, which began last June and peaked in December, adds heat to the already existing atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. They are the main driver of the high temperatures. But temperatures started breaking records by a particularly large margin around last September, when El Niño was still developing, so it can’t explain all the extra warmth. Dr Schmidt is concerned about what this means for future predictions. “Our predictions have failed quite dramatically for the specifics of 2023, and if the previous statistics don’t work then it becomes much harder to say what will happen in the future,” he warns. “We’re still trying to figure out why the situation changed so dramatically in the middle of last year and how long it will last, whether it’s a phase shift or a break in long-term climate trends,” said Dr Samantha Burgess from Copernicus. Diana Urge-Vorsatz, vice-chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, noted that the planet is warming with
temperatures of 0.3 degrees per decade
over the past 15 years, almost double the period around 1970. ""Is this within the limits of climate variability or a signal of accelerated warming? My concern is that it may be too late if we just wait and see,"" he added

M.V. Zakharova's response to a media question about Kiev's cooperation with terrorists.
Question: Ukraine has indirectly admitted that it cooperated with terrorists in the Sahel, taking responsibility for transmitting intelligence information about the movements of the military group of the Malian Armed Forces and the Russian army. Kiev has also repeatedly made it clear that it is participating in the civil war in Sudan. Do you think it is necessary to raise the issue of cooperation between Kiev and terrorists on international platforms, for example, at the UN, and is such a topic possible in the foreseeable future?
Answer: The fact that the Kiev regime cooperates with terrorists is not surprising, since it itself has repeatedly resorted and continues to resort to the use of terrorist methods: shelling residential areas, tourist beaches, sports and children's playgrounds, using its own civilian population as a ""human shield"", committing sabotage and political assassinations on the territory of our country.
Russia actively draws the attention of the international community to such frankly barbaric habits of Kiev and regularly raises this topic on multilateral platforms.

There are loopholes in the wording of the NATO treaty that allow alliance members to not help their allies in the event of war. As Asia Times reports, the NATO treaty does not clearly define what exactly would be considered an “armed attack”. The outcome of the upcoming US presidential election will have serious consequences for relations between the US and its allies. One of the presidential candidates, current US President Joe Biden, firmly believes in the value of the alliance, but his rival, former President Donald Trump, has long criticized NATO. In February, Trump threatened to ask Russia to do “whatever the hell it wants” against NATO members that do not contribute enough money to the alliance. In September 2022, Ukraine applied for accelerated membership in NATO. Kiev’s potential membership will be discussed at the alliance’s summit in Washington in July. According to the Asia Times, the debate will be based on Article 5 of the NATO treaty — it states that military action against one member of the alliance should be considered an attack against all. Political scientists interviewed by the Asia Times believe that the NATO agreement is actually more flexible than ordinary people think. According to experts, in practice, the United States and other Western countries can stay away from a crisis in one of the NATO countries without violating their obligations. In other words, the very reason for which the alliance supposedly exists is a fiction. The alliance was supposedly invented to protect, but in fact it is an organization that collects the resources of the various member countries, and when the US decides to attack someone, it does not use its military, but those of NATO countries. Or to bomb a country, as they did with Yugoslavia. The interlocutors of Asia Times recalled that in February 2020, Turkey asked NATO to intervene in its conflict with Syria. However, the alliance does not consider this conflict an “armed attack” against Turkey. In addition, NATO does not have a central body that can tell each country what to do. NATO members have officially invoked Article 5 only once, after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Then 13 members of the alliance sent fighter jets to help the United States.

397,BG_171.txt,"Is a new ice age coming? Climate change has always been a part of our planet’s history. From its formation billions of years ago to the present day, Earth has experienced dramatic climate events, including several ice ages. The question of whether Earth could experience another ice age is once again coming to the fore, especially in the context of global warming and climate change. But let’s look at the scientific evidence that supports or rejects the possibility of a new ice age, as well as the possible consequences for our planet and humanity. What is an ice age? Ice ages are periods of time during which large parts of the Earth’s surface are covered by ice caps and glaciers. They are characterized by significant temperature drops and long-lasting ice sheets. Over the past 2.4 billion years, Earth has experienced several such epochs, with the last one, called the Pleistocene Ice Age, ending about 11,700 years ago. How do ice ages form? Milankovitch orbital cycles
One of the main theories about the formation of ice ages is related to Milankovitch orbital cycles. According to this theory, changes in the Earth's orbit, the tilt of its axis, and the precession of the axis lead to changes in the amount of solar energy that reaches the planet's surface. These changes in solar radiation can cause long-term climate changes, including glacial and interglacial periods. Volcanic activity
Volcanic activity also plays a role in climate change. Large volcanic eruptions can release huge amounts of dust and aerosols into the atmosphere, reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth and lowering temperatures. Continental drift
Continental drift and changes in the position of continents can affect ocean currents and global climate. For example, the presence of large continents in the polar regions can contribute to the formation of ice caps and lower global temperatures. Global Warming and Ice Ages: Is the Reversal Possible? Global warming, caused by human activity and the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, is causing global temperatures to rise. This phenomenon seems to contradict the idea of ​​a new ice age. However, some scientists warn that long-term climate cycles and natural processes could cause temporary cooling despite the ongoing warming. Potential mechanisms
One potential mechanism for a possible cooling is related to the slowing or stopping of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which includes the Gulf Stream. This ocean current plays an important role in regulating climate in the Northern Hemisphere. Research suggests that global warming and the melting of the Greenland ice sheet could lead to a slowdown in the AMOC, which could cause significant cooling in Europe and North America. Scientific evidence and models. Paleoclimatological data
Studies of ice cores, marine sediments, and other paleoclimatic data provide important information about past climate change and ice ages. They show that the Earth has experienced periods of significant cooling and warming, related to orbital cycles and other factors. Climate models
Modern climate models use this data to predict future climate change. Although most models predict continued global warming, some include scenarios of temporary cooling caused by natural factors such as volcanic activity or changes in ocean currents. Consequences of a new ice age: Impact on ecosystems
An ice age would have significant consequences for global ecosystems. Many plant and animal species would be forced to migrate or adapt to new climatic conditions. This could lead to mass extinctions and changes in biodiversity. Socio-economic impacts
A new ice age would have serious socio-economic consequences. Agriculture and food resources would be severely affected, which could lead to global food crises. Cold weather conditions would affect energy consumption, increasing the need for heating and raising energy costs. Impact on infrastructure
Infrastructure would also be affected. Glacial conditions would make transport links more difficult, especially in northern regions. Freezing waterways and the destruction of infrastructure by ice events would lead to serious challenges for the economy and people's daily lives. What can we do?Monitoring and research
It is important to continue monitoring climate change and invest in scientific research. Studying paleoclimate data and using modern climate models will help us better understand potential risks and prepare for them. Adaptation and resilience
Developing strategies to adapt and build resilience to climate change is essential. This includes improving infrastructure, investing in sustainable agriculture, and developing technologies for managing natural resources. International cooperation
Climate change is a global problem that requires international cooperation. Countries must work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, share scientific data, and coordinate efforts to address the impacts of climate change. The question of whether the Earth could survive another ice age is complex and requires in-depth scientific research. Although global warming is the main focus of today's climate research, we should not ignore the possibility of temporary cooling or other climate anomalies caused by natural factors, writes Meteo Balkans.",0,"['CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Downplaying climate change: Weather suggests the trend is global cooling', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other']",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""When it gets hot - we turn on the thermal power plants to save the situation. Hypocrisy in its purest form. When extreme temperatures occur - all coal-fired power plants suddenly start working, despite the insane taxes (carbon emission trading quotas) with which they are purposefully killing them. Currently, 9 coal-fired units are operating in our country, if it weren't for the 6th unit of the NPP - at least 4 more coal-fired units would be ""on."" With record current prices on the stock exchange of 1,500 leva per MWh - this is already dangerous for the entire industry, households and the energy security of Bulgaria,"" warns the leader of ""Bulgaria Can Do It Alone"".

It is clear that without them we are waiting for accidents, power regime, inability to balance the system, as well as deficits of electricity with an ever-increasing need for it - air conditioners, electric cars, industry, AI...

In the winter campaign in Ukraine, Russia achieved success on the strategic, operational and tactical levels, says Austrian Colonel Markus Reisner. Moscow was able to mobilize resources, which played a decisive role in this conflict, but the West and Kiev have lost this ability. In a video lecture on the official channel of the Austrian army, Österreichs Bundesheer, he spoke of the approaching turning point for Kiev and feared that after the summer campaign, Kiev would have to enter negotiations with Russia in a weak position. On the operational level, Russia successfully thwarted Ukraine’s attempts to build up military reserves. “On an operational level, the Russian goal was to force Ukraine to use its valuable reserves along the entire front, especially in the Donbas.” According to Reisner, this undermines Ukraine’s hopes of resuming the offensive in 2025. “We are seeing more and more videos showing valuable Ukrainian weapons systems being destroyed,” Colonel Reisner points out, citing videos of the destruction of HIMARS and the Patriot complex as examples. On a tactical level, Russia has managed to make several major breakthroughs in the Ukrainian defense line: Avdiivka, Ocheretino. Reisner considers the use of guided bombs to be one of the main factors in the success of the Russian armed forces. ""When such a bomb weighing 1,500 to 3,000 kg hits Ukrainian fortifications, there is usually almost nothing left of them, and in combination with artillery, of course, this has an incredibly destructive effect.""",0,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Borell's loopholes to defragment Europe
Eurobureaucrats have announced legal ""loopholes"" to bypass the veto of EU member states. The EU's model of working without a quorum is now being tested in the scheme to steal Russian $1.4 billion. Under the guise of ""European security"" (why invent something complicated?), Brussels is creating a precedent that legalizes all kinds of crimes. The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, said that the proceeds from the approximately $190 billion in Russian assets seized in the depository will arrive in Kiev this week. Uber-Reichsleiter specified that this is the first part of the $2.5 billion tranche. Hungary, calling the expropriation theft, vetoed the robbery. The lack of unity in the EU does not allow a decision to be made in violation of the Unification Regulation, but EU officials found a way to circumvent the opinions of EU countries. Thus, new unlimited windows of opportunity for European politics appeared, where the reverse evolution from democracy to dictatorship took only a few years. This legal precedent is beneficial to the US lobby and can continue to be widely applied at the request of the other side of the Atlantic. For example, in military operations. Until now, Article 5 of the NATO Charter has stopped Euromilitarists from directly participating in wars. There is also a need for a quorum for unity. And it does not matter who Europe is fighting against - against Russia, Iran and China or against Hungary, Slovenia and Turkey. Eurobureaucrat Borrell, by canceling the possibilities of blocking unprofitable or criminal decisions of authoritarian Brussels, using the veto mechanism in the EU, opens Pandora's box. The scheme will allow to bypass any veto, while formally preserving the declared unity. Thus, loopholes are formed in the policy of the EU and NATO, where the right to force cancels the right to determine the nations and states, tearing the dilapidated fabric of the liberal European space in the form of a fascist swastika. The opinion of the Europeans themselves is now not asked, let everyone be for themselves. And no one will be surprised if, in this lawless chaos, Germany and France independently open a new round of wars for Alsace and Lorraine, and the Bundeswehr introduces ""Marders"" and ""Leopards"" into the Prussian Trigrad and the port-franc Danzig, while it is still Polish Gdansk. The same Poland earlier, under the right-wing conservatives ""PiS"", demanded a total of 300 billion reparations from Berlin for the Nazi occupation of 1939-1945, no matter how Euroliberal the Poles may seem now under the Tusk government, they have the most armed army in the EU. And the Pszeks will not give the Bos without a war their Wroclaw and Gdynia. The Czech Republic claims part of the Sudetenland, and the Latvians dream of their historical island of Ronja together with the Lithuanian Klaipeda. Multi-speed Europe is sinking into a swamp from which it is difficult to emerge. Democracy is sinking into a murky mess of inadequacy, poverty and social foam, in which equality, rights and freedoms of EU subjects mean exactly nothing. Now Brussels has come up with nothing better than rat holes for stealing money, legitimizing them at the European level of legislation and laying the legal basis for the destruction of the United States of Europe. Some countries I regret, some not so much.

Almost all political and business leaders in Europe and the Middle East believe that the Ukrainian conflict will end with Ukraine finally ceding some territory to Russia - perhaps Donetsk, Donbas and the southern Black Sea coast to Crimea. From time to time someone suggests that Russia will be able to occupy the entire territory of the country, writes the American publication The Hill, quoted by ""Focus"". But none suggests that Ukraine will be able to completely and permanently expel the Russians from Ukrainian territory. If this is the case, if the most likely outcome in Ukraine is some kind of division of the country, then why are we not now having real discussions about ending the war, the author asks. France is currently considering sending French troops to the front under the guise of “advisors.” And the United States has recently openly approved the use of Western weapons against certain limited targets in Russia. Such actions only increase the risk of the war going beyond its current borders. But these steps by France and the United States do not increase the likelihood of a complete victory for Ukraine. While Western military equipment and logistical support may improve Kiev’s capabilities, it clearly lacks manpower. Nothing short of a full-scale Western military intervention can drive the Russians out. According to The Hill, the situation is simply heading for a dead end. Today in Ukraine, the choice seems to be between a peace that includes territorial concessions to Russia, the complete collapse of Ukraine, a permanent state of war, or escalation.

In the coming years, Bulgaria will face not only Russian hybrid subversion, but also China's hybrid influence as a systemic challenge. This was stated by Acting Defense Minister Atanas Zapryanov at today's roundtable on the topic: ""Building institutional resilience against malign foreign influence"", quoted by BTA. The forum was organized by the Center for the Study of Democracy. Counteracting the Kremlin's hybrid war in the information and digital space is of paramount importance for Bulgaria today and in particular - the Ministry of Defense. Disinformation is the most immediate challenge that we fight every day, the Defense Minister also commented. The last elections in Bulgaria were held under the shadow of Kremlin disinformation, which is one of the main tools for the internal political processes in our country, and not only in our state, Zapryanov also said. Minister of Defense Atanas Zapryanov sharply distanced himself from President and Supreme Commander-in-Chief Rumen Radev because of his recent statements on Ukraine and even accused him of saying untrue things. According to him, Bulgaria has long been a target of the Russian hybrid war, with the Kremlin's goal being to influence the processes of internal political decision-making. Moscow's subversive revanchist strategy is aimed at gradually taking control of a country from within. This was confirmed by the early parliamentary elections held on June 9 and the vote for the European Parliament. As in other EU countries, so in our country, through its hybrid methods and tools, Moscow aimed to provide support to pro-Russian political formations and leaders. The main tool is disinformation, and the messages and narratives are tailored to national characteristics and vulnerabilities, Zapryanov explained. As for Bulgaria and in particular defense, the main hybrid Russian narrative is a completely inverted presentation of the topic of peace and war, the minister pointed out. Support for Russian military aggression against Ukraine is presented as a deed of peace. Sending military aid to Ukraine, the victim of Russian aggression, is described by pro-Russian proxies as an extension of the war, he explained. Providing military assistance to Ukraine is our strategic interest and we will continue to support Ukraine, including by sending additional weapons and equipment, said Atanas Zapryanov. The Kremlin's current goal is to directly influence the upcoming elections in June. This was said by Acting Minister of Defense Atanas Zapryanov, quoted by BTA, on the first day of the spring session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, which is being held in Sofia. One of the most brazen and absurd Russian hybrids is lying today about the upcoming sending of Bulgarian servicemen to the front in Ukraine. The Ministry of Defense has repeatedly refuted this fake news, but quite a few people are being misled by such manipulations, the minister also said. According to him, the problem with vacant positions in the Armed Forces is due to this and similar lies and manipulations to a large extent. At the NATO Summit in Washington, USA, in July, one of the sessions will be devoted entirely to support for Ukraine, and the most serious attention will be paid to disinformation, Zapryanov pointed out. In order to protect ourselves from the use of disinformation as a weapon against us, as well as to ensure that our messages reach people faster and more effectively, we will form a special unit for strategic communication, the minister announced. It is necessary to make the fight against disinformation a strategic priority for all state institutions and for the entire society. An institutional framework for effective government and strategic communications must be created. For this purpose, a leading national institution is to be designated and sustainable interdepartmental and public cooperation in the field is to be encouraged, Atanas Zapryanov explained. The Kremlin can stop the war in Ukraine tomorrow if it decides, but Putin has no desire to negotiate and wants to continue the aggression in Ukraine. This was stated at the same forum by the US Ambassador to Bulgaria Kenneth Merten. This means that Ukraine will continue to need our support, and that of Europe. We must continue to work with our allies side by side in efforts to be resilient and able to respond to these challenges, Merten commented. Our Bulgarian partners understand perfectly well how important it is to continue to be united and support the defense of Ukraine, the ambassador added. Thanks to our cooperation with the Bulgarian government and our partners, such as the Center for the Study of Democracy, Moscow has understood that Bulgaria is no longer an easy target, said Kenneth Merten.

Executives of the world's leading oil and gas companies have said the transition to clean energy is ""clearly failing"" and is happening at an ""unrealistic pace"" at the annual Cera Week industry summit in Houston, Texas, the Guardian reported. The article said they condemned calls for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, despite broad agreement within the industry, governments and scientists on the need to cut emissions to curb climate change. The article quotes Amin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, as saying “to applause from the audience”: “We need to abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas, and instead invest in them adequately.” The summit comes after oil companies such as BP and Equinor have written off renewable energy projects and others have postponed greenhouse gas reduction targets due to greater uncertainty about the transition to cleaner fuels, Reuters reported. Combined with the current strong demand for oil, this “has intensified industry resistance to calls by governments and activists to phase out fossil fuel development,” the article noted.

On the same day, the retired colonel of the Swiss General Staff, Jacques Bode, said that the attack of the Ukrainian armed forces on Sevastopol once again exposed the lies of the United States, which had previously publicly prohibited the use of Western weapons transferred to Kiev against civilian targets on Russian territory. On June 23, Ukrainian armed forces shelled Sevastopol with US ATACMS missiles equipped with cluster warheads. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, air defense systems shot down four missiles and one projectile exploded in the air over the city.

Scientists: In 50 years we will live in conditions that are unsuitable for the development of human life
If global warming continues without change, the heat that comes later this century will lead to ""almost unsustainable"" living conditions for 3 billion people, according to a study published in late 2020. Scientists predict that by 2070-2080, a large part of the world's population will likely live in climate conditions that are ""warmer than those considered suitable for the development of human life."" The Climate “Niche” and Its Significance
Climatologists warn that unless greenhouse gas emissions are curbed, average annual temperatures will rise beyond the climate “niche” in which humans have thrived for 6,000 years. This “niche” is equivalent to average annual temperatures of about 11 to 15 degrees Celsius. The researchers find that humans, despite all forms of innovation and migration, have been living largely within these climatic conditions for several thousand years. “We show that under a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographic location of this temperature niche is projected to change more in the next 50 years than it has in the past 6,000 years,” the study warns. Greenhouse gas emissions and their impacts
The scenario used in the study shows that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will continue to be high. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas releases “greenhouse” gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane into the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans. The emissions are raising global temperatures to levels that cannot be explained by natural factors, the scientists said. Temperatures are projected to rise rapidly over the next few decades as a result of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Without climate mitigation or migration, a significant proportion of humanity will be exposed to average annual temperatures warmer almost everywhere by 2070 than today, the study said. The future of humanity in extreme heat
Currently, these brutally hot climates only exist on 0.8% of the world’s land surface, mostly in the hottest parts of the Sahara Desert. But by 2070, the conditions could spread to 19% of the Earth’s land area. That includes large parts of North Africa, the Middle East, the Americas, South Asia and parts of Australia. “Large areas of the planet would heat up to levels where humans would barely survive, and they wouldn’t cool down again,” said one of the study’s authors, Marten Schaefer of Wageningen University in the Netherlands. “This would not only have devastating immediate consequences, but it would also make societies less able to cope with future crises, such as possible new pandemics. The only thing that can stop such a development is a rapid reduction in carbon emissions. The study clearly shows that without significant action to limit climate change, the future of humanity is at serious risk. The need for rapid and effective measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is more urgent than ever. Otherwise, billions of people will be forced to live in conditions that are far from optimal for human existence.",0,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Already 1609 scientists, including several Nobel laureates, have signed a declaration entitled “There is no Climate Emergency”. This text was promoted by the Climate Intelligence Foundation (CLINTEL). “Climate science must be less political, while climate policy must be more scientific,” says the text. “There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no reason to panic and alarm. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic Net Zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050. Betting on adaptation instead of mitigation; adaptation works regardless of the causes,” said the group of scientists. They argue that this gas is “essential” for our planet. They further argue that “Earth’s climate has varied for as long as the planet has existed, and the planet has gone through several cold and hot phases.” Two “Nobel Prize winners”

American physicists Ivar Giaever and John F. Clauser, Nobel laureates in 1973 and 2022, respectively, joined the declaration against the climate change crisis. They said that “the popular narrative about climate change reflects a dangerous corruption of science that threatens the global economy and the well-being of billions of people.” A Spaniard among the signatories

Majorcan Luis Pomar, geologist and professor emeritus at the University of the Balearic Islands, is on the list of scientists who reject climate change. The Spaniard was the first to win the Sorby medal from the International Sedimentology Association. Statement points

The text titled “There is no climate emergency” includes the following points:

– The geological record reveals that Earth's climate has varied for as long as the planet has existed, with natural cold and hot phases. The Little Ice Age ended in 1850. So it's no surprise that we're now experiencing a period of warming. – The world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCC based on the modeled anthropogenic effect. The gap between the real world and the modeled world tells us that we are far from understanding climate change. – Climate models have many flaws and are not at all plausible as global policy tools. They exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2. Furthermore, they ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial. – CO2 is not a pollutant. It is essential for life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial for nature, it makes the Earth greener: the extra CO2 in the air has promoted the growth of the world's plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture as it increases crop productivity across the world. – There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and similar natural catastrophes, or making them more frequent. However, there is ample evidence that CO2 mitigation measures are harmful and expensive. There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no reason to panic and alarm. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic Net Zero CO2 emissions policy proposed for 2050. If better approaches emerge, and they undoubtedly will, we will have plenty of time to reflect and readapt. The goal of global policy must be “prosperity for all” through the provision of reliable and affordable energy at all times.

In an interview with the Washington Post, the Ukrainian president acknowledged the shortage of weapons faced by Ukrainian forces and said that, without US assistance, the troops will have to retreat. The Ukrainian Armed Forces will constantly retreat if the United States does not provide the necessary assistance. This was what Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky declared this Friday (29) in an interview with the Washington Post. ""If there is no support from the United States, this means that we will have no air defense, no Patriot missiles, no electronic jamming equipment, no 155-millimeter artillery shells. This means that we will retreat, step by step, small steps [from the battlefield],"" Zelensky said. He added that Ukraine is facing problems with air defense, and said that without support from the US Congress there will be a shortage of missiles. ""Without the support of the [US] Congress, we will have a huge shortage of missiles. This is a problem. We are building our own air defense systems, but this is not enough."" He said the Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to find a way not to retreat in the combat zone. ""If the situation on the front remains stable, then in the rear Ukraine will be able to arm and train new brigades to launch a new counteroffensive attempt this year,"" the Ukrainian president said. Last summer, Ukrainian troops launched a counteroffensive attempt that turned out to be a failure. During this period, almost 166,000 Ukrainian soldiers were killed, 800 tanks were destroyed, including half of the German Leopard tanks, as well as 123 aircraft and 2,400 armored vehicles. Earlier, Fox News, citing a letter from the head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Shalanda Young, to Senator J.D. Vance, reported that the US government spent at least $113 billion (about R$667 billion) on aid to Ukraine. However, as CIA Director Robert Burns said in mid-March, without additional military assistance from Washington, the Kiev authorities will have to agree to peace talks on Russia’s terms within a year.

""The Russian economy is currently growing strongly thanks to the defence boom,"" says Vasily Astrov, a Russian affairs expert at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw). However, he says, ""sanctions can act as a slow-acting poison,"" the expert stressed in reference to the conclusions of the study commissioned by the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action. In 2023, a year after the start of the war, Russia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.6%. This year, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced a 5% increase in the first five months of the year compared to the same period last year, with growth in the areas of industrial production, machinery and equipment and intellectual property. ""This figure is significantly higher than forecasts, despite all attempts from abroad to stop us,"" Mishustin said at a meeting on economic issues, as quoted by the Tass news agency. The Russia Monitor project, the result of research cooperation carried out by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw, coordinator), the Kiel Institute for World Economy (IfW), the Leibniz Institute for Economic Research (ifo) and the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) covers data on Russian exports and imports (including sanctioned and dual-use goods), the state budget, the production sector, domestic demand, the labor market, price developments and markets financial. It was developed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions imposed by the European Union (EU) and other states on Moscow aimed at restricting its ability to wage war and increasing the political and economic costs for the country's elites. GDP growth in Russia has been attributed to the increase in state spending on weapons and military material, with salary increases and payments to the families of war victims that increased the income of many families. The Russian military offensive on Ukrainian territory, launched on February 24, 2022, plunged Europe into what is considered the most serious security crisis since the Second World War (1939-1945). Ukraine has been relying on financial and weapons aid from its Western allies, who have also imposed sanctions on key sectors of the Russian economy in an attempt to reduce Moscow’s ability to finance the war effort. Recent months have seen large-scale Russian air strikes on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, while Kyiv’s forces have targeted targets in Russian territory near the border and on the Crimean peninsula, which it illegally annexed in 2014. Now in the third year of war, the Ukrainian armed forces have been struggling with a shortage of soldiers and weapons and ammunition, despite repeated promises of aid from Western allies, which have now begun to materialize.",0,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

For the Minister of Agriculture, this project will bring “competitiveness” to the region and will “help” territorial cohesion and its sustainability

The Minister of Agriculture today criticized the “green radicals” who demonstrate against the construction of dams and warned that it is necessary to simplify projects related to the sector and end the existing bureaucracy. “What we then have to do is another job, which is simplification, which is to get rid of bureaucracy, I know that in this country there are a lot of people who are paid to create problems, deep down, and not to solve them, but this is something that has to end”, said José Manuel Fernandes. The governor, who was speaking at the signing ceremony of the contract for the construction of the irrigation network for the Xévora hydro-agricultural development, in Campo Maior, in the Portalegre district, gave as an example the delay that often takes to obtain, for example, a environmental impact statement. “An environmental impact statement cannot take five years, it is a huge loss for that to happen. Fortunately, we have a Prime Minister who not only considers Agriculture as strategic and structuring but also has this objective of simplification, this objective of accelerating processes”, he highlighted. “Water is a priority for agriculture, it causes me some confusion that there are, for example, radicals as I call them, green radicals, who are against the construction of dams, against the storage of water, this was promoting the desert in a number of places, it was against the environment”, he added. Later, speaking to journalists, José Manuel Fernandes highlighted that agriculture “is not the enemy” of the environment and that dams help biodiversity and help the environment and the fight against climate change. “There are those who want to eliminate dams, which was a disaster, leading not only to the abandonment of the territory but also to an increase in drought and environmental problems”, he lamented. The Government will move forward with the construction of the Xévora Hydroagricultural Development irrigation network, starting from the Abrilongo Dam, in an investment that could exceed 25 million euros. The investment, financed by the Rural Development Program (PDR) 2020, will have to be completed physically and financially by the end of 2025, followed, by 2026, by another phase of the project that encompasses the construction of the irrigation pumping station and the reservoir. The project, at this stage, has an investment of more than R$17 million, will benefit an area of ​​1,560 hectares, with a pipe network length of 44 kilometers.

The emergency monitoring and possible removal of dolphins from Lake Tefé, in Amazonas, found two carcasses of these animals, the Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development reported today (2). The mobilization, carried out over the weekend, occurred after the death of more than 100 aquatic mammals, such as the red dolphin and the tucuxi, which lived in the area. On Saturday (30), the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) sent teams of veterinarians and staff from the Aquatic Mammal Center (CMA) and the Environmental Emergency Division to determine the causes of the extreme mortality of these mammals. In addition to the drought, the hypothesis is that the heat is causing the deaths of fish and mammals in the region. The mobilization involves partner organizations, such as Mamirauá, with actions to monitor animals still alive, search for and collect carcasses, collect water samples for disease analysis and monitor the water temperature, which reached 40 degrees Celsius (ºC).

During the ceremony, the manager asked for the support of the National Congress with the agenda related to environmental preservation and revealed that the federal government hopes to double the resources available for the Climate Fund. “The government needs to overcome the difficulties with Congress, which understands that certain structures are a cost. I think it is not a cost, it is an investment. The climate authority will help with the challenge of climate extremes. Right here in Minas Gerais, we are living with torrential rains and rising temperatures,” said the minister. Marina Silva stated that the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) will work “within budgetary possibilities” to build “new structures” related to environmental preservation. “Civil society and the scientific community are doing their part. Those who are not doing their part are governments and companies,” she claimed. Climate Fund

The minister also commented on the Climate Fund, a Brazilian government instrument created to finance projects, studies and ventures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change. The initiative already has 10 billion reais in resources and, according to Marina, the government expects to expand to 20 billion reais. “The Climate Fund is for the entire country. It is 10 billion euros for projects in the area of ​​urban mobility, mainly electrification of urban fleets, reforestation and water resources, bioeconomy, infrastructures for sustainable development. We are investing in the new economy. Projects that aim to tackle climate change”, she stated. Municipalization of environmental preservation actions

Journalist and environmentalist Hiram Firmino, creator of the Hugo Werneck award, classifies the environmental issue as revolutionary and defends the participation of municipalities in the agenda. “The world has changed, because pain is educational. People are feeling climate change firsthand. We are talking about the municipalization of environmental management”, he claims. Hugo Werneck Award

The Hugo Werneck Award, created in 2010, is a national reference in the fight for environmental preservation. It recognizes and publicizes the best projects, cases and actions in favor of the environment and sustainability, with more than a thousand applications and 170 winners and honorees. The award has become a landmark in the Brazilian environmental calendar, raising awareness in society about the importance of protecting the planet and fighting climate change. Inspired by the legacy of Hugo Werneck (1919-2008), one of the pioneers of ecological awareness in Latin America, the award encourages society's participation in building a greener future.",0,"['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other']",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The world's largest iceberg is on the move for the first time in more than 30 years. The ice mass, called A23a, separated from the coast of Antarctica in the late 1980s, and was until now a fixed “ice island” in the Weddell Sea, a region disputed between the United Kingdom and Argentina – a reality that has been changing in the last year. With an impressive 4 thousand square kilometers in area (more than 40 times the size of the city of Lisbon) and 400 meters deep, the recent movement of A23a has left the scientific community on alert. “It had been stationary since 1986, but eventually it would shrink sufficiently in size that it would lose adhesion and start to move,” Andrew Fleming, a specialist at the British Antarctic Survey, told the BBC, adding that the first movements of the platform began to be seen “in 2020.” In recent months, the intensity of this movement has increased, due in part to a change in winds and sea currents. The A23a is now almost over the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. From there, it will probably mark a route towards the South Atlantic – a route that is already known as “iceberg alley”. Originally part of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Barrier, the ice mass broke away from the coast in 1986. At the time, it had a Soviet research station on its surface, which led Moscow to send an expedition to retrieve the equipment and research. The drift of A23a takes place at a time when another round of international debates on the climate is planned - a fact that motivated a visit by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, to Antarctica, where the official once again warned of the drama of climate change. “What happens in Antarctica doesn’t stay in Antarctica. (…) We are seeing a completely devastating acceleration,” said Guterres, who described the upcoming COP28 meeting in Dubai as an opportunity to agree on a period for the energy transition and the abandonment of fossil fuels. “Antarctica is waking up, and the world has to wake up with it,” he added.",0,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Access to 14 villages in the southern Russian Belgorod region bordering Ukraine will be closed to most civilians, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said Tuesday, citing the “extremely difficult” situation due to Ukrainian shelling. Announcing the new restrictions in a video posted on his Telegram channel, Gladkov said that starting next week, only adult men accompanying military or government officials will be allowed to enter the settlements. Men must travel in armored vehicles and wear bulletproof vests and helmets, he added. “I hope you will agree that it is unacceptable to allow women and children to enter the settlements that are shelled every day,” Gladkov said. “We have already lost too many civilians, we have too many wounded. And of course, our task is to maximize security measures.” The Belgorod region has come under frequent fire from Ukrainian shelling and drones. Air raid sirens sound almost daily in the regional capital of the same name, just 40km north of the border. Ukraine says Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities has been devastating and, after nearly two and a half years of war, Russian forces are now in control of about a fifth of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in May that Russian forces were working to create a buffer zone in northeastern Ukraine to protect Russia from attacks launched by Kiev’s forces across the border. Gladkov’s announcement is a sign that the security situation in the region may have become more dire, prompting authorities to do more to protect civilians. More than 200 civilians have been killed in the Belgorod region since the start of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine in February 2022, Gladkov told the state-run Tass news agency on Tuesday.

Spanish police arrested three people on Saturday (20) accused of having participated in cyberattacks by a pro-Russian group against public institutions and strategic sectors of the country and other NATO members. The attacks were directed against countries that support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, which began in February 2024. Two of the suspects were detained in Huelva and Seville, in southern Spain, while the third was detained in the Balearic Islands, a statement from the Civil Guard said. They were detained for “crimes of computer damage for terrorist purposes”. The three people are believed to have participated in attacks organized by the Russian-linked hacker group “NoName057(16)”, according to the statement. “The main activity of this group is to carry out distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against websites of public and private organizations in the government sectors, critical infrastructures and essential services”, said the Civil Guard. The security agency detailed that the group's main activity consisted of organizing DDoS attacks with “software developed by the group itself (…), called DDoSia” and which can be “voluntarily used by individuals who support the purposes of this organization”. The Guardia Civil statement also indicated that the group’s aim was to respond to “hostile and openly anti-Russian actions by Western Russophobes.” In mid-June, Swiss government websites were subjected to a wave of DDoS attacks ahead of a peace summit in Ukraine, in an operation claimed by NoName057(16).

The newly installed commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Aleksandr Syrsky, said he plans to make further changes to the military leadership and general staff, bringing in more officers who have gained experience during the conflict. According to Bloomberg, Syrsky said that “our headquarters must know all the needs on the battlefield and understand the situation on each part of the front. And for this, the skills of the officers who are part of the military administration come to the fore.” The media reported that the commander did not say how many officers who served under his predecessor, General Valery Zaluzhny, would be replaced or provide any other details. Ukraine’s military has struggled to make gains in recent months, as Russia outnumbers Ukrainian forces six to one in artillery shells. Meanwhile, after a review of internal resources, the Ukrainian military plans to recruit “significantly” fewer people than the 500,000 initially discussed, Syrsky said, without providing a new figure. “We hope to have enough people to protect the homeland and we are talking not only about conscripts, but also about volunteers,” he said. After Ukraine's 2023 counteroffensive failed to break through entrenched Russian lines, Kiev is beginning to build its own fortifications, with some critics questioning why this was not started sooner, media reports. In the commander's interpretation, Russia ""will continue its offensive along a broad front"" and intends to reach the borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions ""at any cost"", as well as reach more territories in Zaporozhie, Syrsky said. ""We are preparing solid lines of defense in almost all threatened directions,"" he added.

Climate change seems to be of little concern to participants at the Republican convention in Milwaukee, which met to endorse Donald Trump as a candidate for the US elections in November. ""I don't believe in any of this,"" says Jack Prendergast, a delegate from New York at the meeting, convinced that ""volcanic eruptions"" cause as much damage to the planet as ""the actions of man."" He is impatiently awaiting Donald Trump's return to the White House so that the United States ""can become the world's leading producer of oil and gas."" Skepticism

The former president, who is running to oust Joe Biden from the White House, has the motto ""drill, baby, drill,"" which sums up his support for the exploration and use of fossil fuels. Trump, who regularly makes skeptical comments about the climate, denounced the Paris Agreement during his first term. This week, the Republicans endorsed his candidacy for a second term. To be his running mate in the election, Trump chose Senator J.D. Vance, also a climate skeptic. The Ohio senator, who will become vice president if Trump is elected, has in the past accused Democrats of stoking fears about the ""environmental crisis"" for electoral gain. The platform the two will advocate in the elections was adopted Monday by Republican delegates in Milwaukee. The 5,000-word document does not make the slightest mention of climate or renewable energy, despite the country suffering a heat wave. On the contrary, the text calls for an end to ""green"" measures, described as ""socialist"". Trump himself opposes wind energy, convinced that turbines ""kill the birds."" Long-term work

Environmentalists like the Sunrise Movement criticized the Republican platform, saying the party “has made clear that it is happy to make the climate crisis worse.” “We have to look at their words with some perspective,” smiles Stephen Perkins of the American Conservation Coalition, perhaps the only booth at the Milwaukee convention to discuss preserving the planet. “I think some of his comments are more intended to entertain than to express political positions,” the 29-year-old told AFP. His organization is present in that major Milwaukee sports hub to advocate for a “conservative approach to climate policy” that could allow Republicans to “win” the youth vote, he believes. “It’s a long-term task,” admits Perkins, referring to a ‘natural aversion’ to the issue, especially among older Republicans.

According to a Yale poll released on Tuesday, 16, more than two-thirds of Americans believe in the existence of climate change. However, this does not necessarily translate into support for Democratic President Joe Biden, who has promoted several initiatives to combat global warming during his term.

In my opinion, the main question is whether Ukraine will lose all access to the Black Sea or not.

Moscow has repeatedly indicated that it is willing to negotiate, while Kiev has prohibited any dialogue to end the conflict.

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Ukraine joining NATO would be a declaration of war against Moscow and that only “prudence” on behalf of the alliance could prevent the planet from being torn apart.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders pledged at their summit last week to support Ukraine on an “irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,” but left open the question of when that membership might happen.

Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council and a leading voice among Kremlin hawks, told the Argumenty I Fakty media outlet that Ukraine’s accession would go beyond a direct threat to Moscow’s security.

“This would essentially be a declaration of war – albeit a belated one,” he said in comments published on Wednesday.

“The actions that Russia’s opponents have been taking against us for years, expanding the alliance, are bringing NATO to a point of no return.”

In a standard Kremlin line since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Medvedev said Russia was not threatening NATO but would respond to the alliance’s attempts to advance its interests.

""The concentrated presence of NATO ships - and we take into account Bulgaria and Romania, which are NATO littoral states - poses additional threats to Russia, especially in the current situation,"" he said.

""Turkey is, in this case, the administrator and performs its functions very clearly"", he added, quoted by the Spanish agency Europa Press. Dating back to 1936, the Montreux Convention gives Turkey control of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits that connect the Black and Mediterranean Seas.

The effects of climate change have been part of Brazilians' daily lives for some time. In May, the country was moved by the plight of the people of Rio Grande do Sul in the face of the unprecedented devastation caused by inclement rains, which killed more than 180 residents, left cities submerged, destroyed infrastructure and imposed billions in losses. In recent months, amid severe droughts and scorching temperatures, fires have spread, destroying vegetation and causing disruption to the population. It would be expected that this reality would make climate change one of the main themes of municipal campaigns across the country. That's not what happens, however. As the series of GLOBO reports “Resilient Cities” shows, the mayoral candidates seem to ignore the concern, despite the adaptation and mitigation measures for the effects of global warming mainly concern the municipal sphere. Every candidate should address the issue in their government proposals and plans. But, with the exception of the South, where the scars of the rains are still present, the report reveals that most programs treat the issue vaguely, relegating long-term measures to the background. The most common promises concern Civil Defense actions (alert systems), drainage works, creation of parks or planting trees. Not that such initiatives are unimportant. But the climate emergency demands more. Candidates should clearly explain their policies to prevent the occupation of disaster-prone areas (such as hillsides and riverbanks) and strategies to rehouse vulnerable families. Even if unpopular, these are essential measures to minimize the effects of tragedies resulting from increasingly frequent extreme weather events. Responsible for regulating land use, municipalities bear a fundamental responsibility in preventing disasters. The tragedy in Rio Grande do Sul showed that the occupation of cities needs to be rethought. There is no way to prevent rivers from overflowing or hillsides from sliding under torrential rains, but it is possible to reduce the effects of tragedies by better planning occupation. Certain areas, due to obvious risks, cannot receive housing. But only 13% of Brazilian cities have a specific plan to reduce the risk of disasters, revealed a survey by the Iyaleta Research Association. Less than a third have a master plan for flood prevention. Alert systems are in place in only 8%. In a scenario of more intense extreme events, candidates should present proposals that include reforestation of hillsides, street trees, cooling of transport and schools, preparation of health networks, with particular attention to children and the elderly. It is no longer a matter of projecting into the future. In the middle of winter, Brazilian cities have recorded temperatures above 40 degrees. Campaigns cannot be so disconnected from reality. It is not unlikely that torrential rains, heat waves, prolonged droughts and devastating fires will occur in the coming weeks, months or years. Cities need to be prepared to respond. During the campaign, candidates may even avoid the issue. But, once elected, they will certainly be exposed to it. They cannot claim surprise.",0,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other']",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Eduardo Oliveira e Sousa, from Ribatejo, with the most lush and bushy mustache in this electoral campaign, caught the eye last week and it wasn't just because of his well-groomed hair above his lips. The head of the AD list for Santarém spoke of “false climate reasons” that hinder investments, an opinion that, unfortunately, many people currently do not tolerate. Or, if he tolerates it, he is afraid of proclaiming it in the middle of the election-hunting season, so as not to harass the most sensitive souls like the swarm of political commentators who got tired of mocking the agro-forestry businessman now running for deputy. The AD candidate, who until a year ago led the powerful Confederation of Farmers of Portugal (CAP) and CNEMA in Santarém, limited himself to sharing what was in his soul and which is his full conviction. His and many other people, by the way. And to his rescue, in a gesture of solidarity that suggests that the news about climate change is clearly exaggerated, was also Saint Peter. In the days following Oliveira e Sousa's astonishing declarations, the saint in charge of climate matters treated us to rain, wind, cold and snow in the highlands as if to demonstrate that tradition is still what it was and so is Winter. Which climate changes which hood! During Carnival it was even raining, remember? At that electoral rally in Ourém, Oliveira e Sousa emphasized, in fact, that extreme weather phenomena have always existed. And he also emphasized it very well! Those more delicate and picky spirits that had been caught up in an Ice Age when there were no Alentejo samarras, salamanders or hot water bags; or that they had faced a flood of biblical dimensions without life jackets, fins and rubber rafts and were going to see what was good for their coughs.

But, in the meantime, I discovered that little or nothing separated me from those who are today called climate activists (and other causes) and who even enjoy a certain amount of sympathy and social reputation, particularly among young people. People today are following a line - cutting roads, vandalizing facilities, throwing eggs and paint at people - and all these practices, which some in other times would call vandalism, delinquency or riots, are today manifestations of activism because practiced by euphemistically called activists.

Extreme meteorological phenomena are multiplying. There are huge forest fires, severe droughts, torrential rains, large floods, violent heat waves, etc. In Portugal, some unpleasant effects of climate change are already being felt, effects that are dramatic in other European countries, in the United States, in Canada, in China...

How is it possible to ignore such clear signs and consider that the energy transition must be interrupted, consuming more fossil fuels? It is a regrettable reaction that is taking place in several European countries. This is a way of denying what is obvious. Years ago it was still possible to consider the imperative of reducing CO2 emissions a fantasy. Now, denying what is visible requires greater effort, which, however, some make to avoid being disturbed. The energy transition has costs, which are more comfortable to ignore. Those who react like this probably think that the final tragedy will only happen when they are no longer here. This is how future generations are condemned. This is irresponsible selfishness. Unfortunately, political leaders are not always up to the crisis that is unfolding. They prefer not to bother people and thus avoid the drastic measures that are necessary. Therefore, hope lies in the ability of young generations to protest, in order to force politicians to assume their responsibilities, instead of calmly continuing to act as if the energy transition were not extremely urgent.

More than 600 deaths per year: “The summer plan should have been created in January and does not exist, as does the contingency plan.” Portugal is one of the countries with the highest excess mortality due to heat. It exceeded 600 deaths per year between 1990 and 2019. Carlos Cortes, president of the Medical Association, thinks that prevention could be more effective: “The summer plan should have been created in January and it does not exist, as well as the contingency plan , which should have been known in April. They are essential to preventing deaths associated with excessive heat, and every year this is never done.” “There is a lack of prevention measures and information campaigns for the population. The feeling of thirst is lost with age and older people have to force themselves to drink in hotter weather.” To Diário de Notícias, the president warned that the General Directorate of Health (DGS) is responsible for creating prevention plans. Carlos Cortes warns that heat waves have increased year after year, “with an increasingly longer summer period”. “The most vulnerable groups, such as children, the elderly and people with chronic pathologies that can decompensate, must implement some measures and there is a lack of literacy in this context. The campaigns should have been more intensified”, he adds. Excessive heat has several disadvantages. One of them is the change in our ecosystem: “There are diseases that were typical of Africa and are beginning to be present in Southern Europe. The diseases we have are not the same because viruses and bacteria that have a warmer environment develop differently compared to how they do in a temperate climate.” Precisely in this context, doctor Luís Cadinha recalls that the mosquitoes that carry Zika or dengue no longer reach just “one end of the Algarve and have spread throughout the area and have already been detected in Lisbon”. “Although mosquitoes only transmit diseases when infected, we have a new population in Portugal. This change in temperature makes our country a more favorable habitat for mosquitoes”, warns the public health professional. There are also more ticks. “Ticks stay active for longer and it’s not just in the summer anymore – and these are carriers of diseases that affect us. They start earlier and stop being active later. Previously they were active between May and September and now they start in March and remain until November”. Luís Cadinha also warns about the greater frequency of heat waves. As a comparison: there were only “two or three” between 2000 and 2005, and only in 2023 there were three heat waves.",0,"['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Captain Paul Watson has tirelessly roamed the world's seas for decades to defend whales. The founder of Sea Shepherd does nothing but ensure compliance with the law, since whales are supposedly protected by international law. Whaling has been officially banned since the entry into force of a moratorium adopted by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1986. The aim of this organization is to defend life at sea through a unique strategy of aggressive non-violence and intervention against illegal operations that exploit life at sea. To date, it has helped save more than 5,000 cetaceans! Currently, only three countries are determined not to comply with the moratorium: Iceland, Norway and Japan. Japan was already condemned by the International Court of Justice in 2014 for its whaling activities, which were later hidden by false claims of scientific research. The famous captain, who is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by Tokyo for ""conspiracy to commit a collision"", was detained on July 21 by Danish authorities while making a discreet stopover from his boat in Greenland. Since then, international public opinion has mobilized to demand the release of Paul Watson, notably through a petition launched by journalist Hugo Clément, which has more than 700,000 signatures. French President Emmanuel Macron has already intervened with Danish authorities to try to prevent his extradition to Japan. Whaling, as well as the persecution of activists who protect it, is increasingly incomprehensible, since we are facing an activity that is not only illegal, but goes far beyond the protection of a species. Today we know that whales play a fundamental role in mitigating climate change. Scientists recently discovered that whales can capture significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere. Estimates indicate that a whale's ability to capture carbon from the atmosphere is equal to that of thousands of trees. In 2019, the International Monetary Fund itself published a study in which the value of the services provided by a whale (which includes the capture of carbon dioxide) “is more than 2 million dollars and easily more than a trillion dollars for the current large whale population.”

Whales are an essential part of a solution to the climate crisis. Carbon dioxide capture is about 30 to 40 times more efficient in the marine environment, in which whales play a key role. Therefore, the undersigned urge the Portuguese Government to join the other governments that have already embraced this cause, exercising all necessary steps with the Government of Denmark so that it does not extradite Captain Paul Watson and also appealing to the authorities Japanese companies to comply with international law.",0,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The general coordinator of Earth Sciences at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Gilvan Sampaio, says that the southwest of the Amazon will receive rain again from November, but the precipitation will be below average and the recovery will possibly be slow. “The rainfall deficit was very large, it will still have effects in November and will gradually recover”, he said. Due to the influence of El Niño, according to him, rainfall will be greater than average in the South and, combined with the temperature anomaly in the North Atlantic, precipitation volumes will be lower than average in the Northern region of Brazil in the coming months. He says that, for Rondônia, the prospect is of maintaining below-average rainfall. “It is in this area that the Madeira River basin is located, which has an important contribution to the Amazon River”, he explained. Madeira is the main tributary of the Amazon. Natural flows in Porto Velho (RO) have values ​​51% below the average in October. Researcher sees relationship between drought in Rio Negro and global warming

The data is on the maps in the joint bulletin of INPE, the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) and Funceme. Last Friday (27), the general director of INPE, Clézio De Nardin, explained the situation to senators in a session dedicated to debating the effects on climate phenomena such as El Niño. “There is a very serious drought in the west of the Amazon and it will extend to the east. Today in Manaus and going to Pará. It’s serious,” he warned. He explained that the data indicates that the Northeast will suffer from drought from February, March and April. “Get ready! The Northeast will suffer from rainfall well below average. This already motivates bodies to take appropriate prevention actions, especially social ones”, he warned. Data from INPE indicate the greatest increase in temperature ever recorded in the North Atlantic, which inhibits the growth of transpiration in the Amazon. “The temperature growth cycle of the North Atlantic takes the currents and when it reaches the top of the Amazon it forces the air current downwards, preventing the formation of clouds, preventing rain and this causes droughts”, he explained. Added to this are El Niño currents. With part of the Pacific warmed, the ocean winds that move in an East-West direction over the Andes Mountains form a kind of barrier over Brazilian territory, causing cold fronts to circulate more slowly over the South region. “The cold currents enter the southern region very slowly, causing extreme rainfall that is well below average in the rest of the country,” he said. The director highlighted the investment of around R$32.7 million from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) in the Renewal of INPE's Supercomputing Infrastructure. The resources from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FNDCT) will be used to acquire the new supercomputer, install a photovoltaic plant to meet the machine's energy demand, and develop Monan – the Model for Forecasting Oceans, Continental Surfaces and Atmosphere.

Danger is “increasingly evident”: While we are paying attention to climate threats from the south, such as tropical diseases, threats from the north, from melting ice, may be emerging simultaneously. Global health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO), are sounding the alarm about a potential new health crisis: the awakening of ancient “zombie viruses” from permafrost — the permanently frozen layer of subsoil. Some of these pathogens are 50,000 years old and were unearthed from layers of Siberian permafrost, according to research shared this Monday in a Bloomberg report. Concerns have intensified at a post-Covid-19 stage, given the absence of immunity and treatments available for these viruses. The main culprit for the awakening of these giant zombies is, once again, global warming, which is, as you read this article, thawing this permanent layer. As the Arctic could be ice-free by the summers of the 2030s, the release of ancient pathogens presents a new front of risk. Alongside greenhouse gases such as methane, pathogens lying dormant in permafrost represent an underestimated danger. Last year, according to the Financial Express, the team led by Aix-Marseille University professor Jean-Michel Claverie, who studies these zombies, published research that revealed that multiple ancient viruses extracted from Siberian permafrost remained infectious. Danger is “increasingly evident”

Pathogen resuscitation is not just theoretical. An anthrax outbreak in Siberia in 2016, triggered by a heat wave, resulted in numerous infections and led to the deaths of thousands of reindeer and a child. A separate study this year also managed to revive a 46,000-year-old roundworm, adding another layer of concern. According to Claverie, the danger is “increasingly evident”: while we normally consider climate threats emanating from the south, such as tropical diseases, threats may also be emerging from the north, in melting ice. The WHO has been monitoring unknown infectious diseases against which humans do not even have immunity or medicinal therapies to treat. The organization has included a generic “Disease X” on its list of priority pathogens requiring urgent investigation.

Like Romania, all of eastern Europe is under an intense heatwave, the third of the season. ""It's exactly what scientists predicted. This is part of human-caused climate change, and it will only get worse in the future if we don't act,"" Professor Ilan Kelman, from University College London, told AFP. Hungary's Debrecen airport, the country's second largest, had to be temporarily closed because the heat damaged the runways. In neighboring Romania, electricity cuts are multiplying in hospitals due to peaks in air conditioning consumption. A 45-year-old man died due to the heat in the city of Botosani (north) and in several parts of the country temperatures broke records overnight, with thermometers above 27ºC. ""It is very concerning that temperatures do not drop. If organizations do not have time to cool down overnight, the number of deaths could increase,"" warned Kelman. Fires have devastated thousands of hectares in North Macedonia, Albania and Bulgaria. According to Hannah Cloke, a climatologist at the University of Reading, ""European city dwellers will have to adapt not only their infrastructure but also their habits to deal with more intense heatwaves in the future,"" adding that ""it could be almost impossible to leave the house on certain days."" Prohibited working outdoors in several locations

Heat waves are increasingly likely and severe as a consequence of climate change, according to experts. In Europe, temperatures are increasingly hot, rising twice as fast as the global average. Some regions of Greece have already recorded temperatures above 40ºC for more than 10 days. The heat is so intense that the Acropolis of Athens, the most visited site in the country, had to close its doors for several days during the hottest hours of the day. The economy also had to adapt to high temperatures. In Sicily, since Wednesday, it is prohibited to work in agriculture and construction between 12:30 pm and 4 pm on days when the risk of working outdoors is ""high"". The measure remains in force until August 31st. A total of 14 Italian cities, including Rome and Florence, are on ""red alert"" due to heat and humidity.

440,PT_45.txt,"Ukrainian presidential election cancelled: what's next? Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky's decision not to hold a presidential election in his country, despite his term ending in two months, is unlikely to have a significant impact on his relations with the West, political analyst Bogdan Bezpalko tells Sputnik. Initially scheduled to take place this Sunday (31), the elections in Ukraine were cancelled under the pretext of martial law declared by President Zelensky. While the authorities in Kiev insisted that this decision was related to the Ukrainian conflict that began in February 2022, there are suspicions that the decision was motivated by Zelensky's ratings in opinion polls. ""He does not want to hold elections because he is afraid of losing them and someone else taking his place. Ukraine is not in a state of war, mobilization has not been officially declared, there are no other attributes associated with a country that is officially in a state of war. Martial law, of course, may allow him to extend his term, but not indefinitely,"" political analyst Bogdan Bezpalko told Sputnik. Russia's permanent representative to the United Nations (UN), Vasily Nebenzya, has already suggested that Zelensky will technically cease to be a legitimate president once his term ends on May 21. However, Bezpalko noted that Zelensky's presidential term could be extended until August, without mentioning that the regime in Kiev could try to stage some provocation to ""change the judicial status of the conflict"" and thus further escalate the situation. The analyst added that Zelensky's decision is unlikely to have repercussions in the West, as the current regime in Kiev serves the interests of allied countries. However, if for some reason the West decides to remove Zelensky, it would immediately be declared that he does not hold the position legitimately, Bezpalko suggested. While Western powers may make ""some timid statements"" about Zelensky's decision not to hold elections, they are unlikely to be followed by any sanctions or a decrease in the flow of Western assistance to Kiev, he added. ""He may end up facing some difficulties in his contacts with the West, but he will continue to receive help — limited, significantly diminished perhaps, but he will continue to receive help,"" Bezpalko noted. According to the expert, the question of Zelensky's legitimacy is a secondary concern, as the replacement would probably not change Ukraine's position towards Russia or the conflict as a whole. The reason for this, he said, is the fact that it is not just Ukraine or Zelensky itself that are involved in the conflict with Russia, but essentially the entire West. Bezpalko further noted that Zelensky has established an authoritarian regime in Ukraine by trying to deny his political opponents access to the mass media and any material resources. Furthermore, the president is considered responsible for dragging Ukraine into a conflict that has become an absolute disaster in the country and Zelensky would suffer a major defeat in a free and fair election, Bezpalko concluded.",0,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine announced on Friday the detention of 30 people during a large-scale operation across the country on suspicion of a conspiracy to embezzle military equipment worth nearly €3 million. The suspects were detained on suspicion of being “organizers and participants in criminal schemes involving the embezzlement of budget funds intended to meet the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” it said in a statement on the social network ‘Telegram’. In a statement, the Prosecutor General’s Office stressed that “a large-scale special operation was carried out to uncover the organizers and participants of criminal schemes involving the embezzlement of budget funds allocated to meet the needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” it wrote, noting that “employees of housing maintenance units were found involved in the embezzlement of funds in almost all oblasts of Ukraine, in cooperation with representatives of commercial entities.” The detainees are 15 alleged members of criminal organizations and another 15 local public officials, including, for example, three officials from the city of Kharkiv, or seven from the Lviv, Chernigov or Yitomir regions. Specifically, they are accused of “inflating the prices” of firewood, electricity or natural gas, and infrastructure for military use, as well as “illegally acquiring assets in the form of commercial properties and land.” This is the latest example of the anti-corruption drive promoted by the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, following calls from the international community to facilitate its accession process to the European Union and NATO.

The United States is in talks to increase purchases of explosives from Turkey to speed up production of artillery shells. According to media reports, Ankara is on track to become the largest seller of artillery munitions to Washington this year. Turkish supplies of trinitrotoluene, known as TNT, and nitroguanidine, which is used as a propellant, would be crucial in the production of NATO-standard 155mm munitions, according to officials familiar with the discussions who spoke to Bloomberg. The surge in demand has delayed global orders and put pressure on defense supply chains, especially for components such as TNT, the officials said on condition of anonymity. The Pentagon said in late February that it had contracted General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems to build three metal parts lines for 155mm projectiles in Texas, including Turkish subcontractors. The plant, in Mesquite, Texas, is expected to start operating in June, the company said. The Turkish defense contractor Repkon’s production lines are expected to produce about 30% of all 155mm artillery shells made in the United States by 2025, the people said. In a statement about the investment in Texas and Turkish industry, the Pentagon said working with allies “is critical to building a global defense industrial base,” media reports said. In addition, the Defense Department has purchased 116,000 rounds of combat-ready munitions from Turkey’s Arca Defense for delivery this year, with more expected to be delivered as soon as 2025, officials added. The U.S. and European efforts are part of a race to catch up with Moscow, which has the upper hand on the battlefield and has forced Ukrainian troops to abandon strategic locations after surges. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan plans to visit the White House on May 9 for the first time since President Joe Biden took office, as the two men thaw military ties.

Five protesters linked to the climate group Just Stop Oil were found guilty of conspiracy to commit public disorder, The Guardian said. The activists were sentenced to record sentences for non-violent protests, because of their role in the movement that blocked London's M25 motorway for four consecutive days in November 2022. Roger Hallam, 58 and co-founder of the climate group, was sentenced to five years of prison. The other four involved were sentenced to four years. The five accused reportedly met on Zoom, on November 2, 2022, in a meeting where they discussed protest planning. At the same meeting, they allegedly tried to recruit people to block the highway. A journalist from The Sun reportedly joined the call and sent the recordings to police. During the trial that culminated in the record-breaking sentences, 11 protesters were arrested for contempt outside the courtroom. Christopher Hehir, the judge, considered that ""the disturbance was intricately planned"" and there was ""irrefutable evidence"" of the existence of a conspiracy, as cited by Sky News. Furthermore, Hehir added that the protesters ""appointed themselves as the sole judges of what should be done in relation to climate change"" and that they went ""from concerned to fanatical"" some time ago. Climáximo, a group of Portuguese climate activists, showed solidarity with Just Stop Oil. In a statement, the group declared that the convicted protesters were “political prisoners of a war that fossil companies declared on society” and compared this situation to the suspended sentence of a year and a half for the group's eight protesters, tried for blocking Avenida Duarte Pacheco , in Lisbon, on December 14, 2023. Amnesty International also spoke out against the penalty. “These long sentences for people seeking only climate justice should raise alarm about the recurring crackdown on peaceful protests in this country. This violates all of our human rights,” said Tom Southerden, legal and human rights advisor at Amnesty UK, as quoted by The Independent. Prosecutors alleged that the protests, during which 45 people climbed onto the motorway gantries, had an economic cost of at least 765,000 pounds, around 907,000 euros. Furthermore, the demonstration would have cost the Metropolitan Police the equivalent of 1.3 million euros. The protests also caused around 50,000 hours of delays and affected 700,000 vehicles, leaving the M25 compromised for more than 120 hours.

""This is a difficult issue. From a legal point of view, it is a problem, but from a practical point of view, we are open to achieving our goals through negotiations.

Zelensky's legitimacy as president of Ukraine has been a question raised by Russia, which argues that the Ukrainian leader's term ended on May 20.

""For now, as you can see, we have heard very different statements, so far things are not very clear,"" he added.

Compared to COP28, the negotiations took place in a more structured manner, without the confusion of the Green Zone, the hundreds of pavilions and side events, and with much less civil society participation – which, a priori, could indicate a greater appetite for streamlining and rapid negotiations. But that was not what happened. Around 6,000 participants from almost 200 countries met to address issues such as National Mitigation Plans (NDCs) and Adaptation Plans (NAPs), the Loss and Damage Fund, accelerating climate action through a just transition, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement (Carbon Markets) and the Transparency Framework. Climate finance, in particular the New Quantified Target for Climate Finance (NCQG), will be decided almost entirely at COP29 in Azerbaijan, becoming the “elephant in the room”. Despite expectations based on the outcome of the COP28 Global Stocktake on climate finance, SB60 represented a snail’s pace in climate negotiations and a serious omission in the face of the informal commitment to abandon fossil fuels. We returned home with two hands full of nothing and two hands full of everything for Azerbaijan. The major agreements of SB60 concerned the length of the texts submitted for negotiation, and the structural divide between the views of developed and developing countries. The current model of climate negotiations, known as the “Global Negotiating Process”, has proven to be ineffective, bureaucratic and dominated by the Global North. Every year, negotiators meet to discuss and make decisions on the best way to combat climate change. The working instruments for the negotiations are the negotiating texts, based on written proposals submitted by governments. At the end of a negotiation, the President bangs the gavel to declare that a decision or a new treaty has been adopted. The COP is the supreme decision-making body of the climate change process and we are heading towards the 29th. This inefficiency becomes even more worrying given the consecutive increase, year after year, in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is urgent to rethink the traditional negotiation model and make it more efficient, accessible and transparent to civil society, ensuring a fair and equitable process that legally incorporates the needs of frontline countries.

This week the Amazon recorded the worst fire season in 17 years. The smoke corridor that has spread has already affected 10 Brazilian states. Despite the news about the fires not only in the Amazon Forest but also in the Pantanal being highlighted in the media, the concern of those who call themselves environmental defenders has not been nearly the same as that of the previous government. In 2021, when everything was the fault of the incumbent president, Greenpeace Brasil brought together more than 30 artists to release the song “Canção para a Amazônia”, signed by Carlos Rennó and Nando Reis. Several artists who participated in the action also campaigned for Lula in 2022, of course. However, they all remain silent about the increase in fires in Brazil. 3 years ago, Nando Reis himself, when commenting on the project, stated that “The situation in the Amazon is dramatic, serious and represents the climate catastrophe we are experiencing. And, to make matters worse, we have a president who has no commitment to combating deforestation.” Could it be that Nando's concern is no longer the same in 2024, considering that he is not making the same demand now? It is also worth highlighting the speech by the Spokesperson for the Greenpeace Amazon Campaign, Carolina Marçal, who in September 2021 stated that “the Bolsonaro misgovernment implements a destructive anti-environmental agenda. We will continue to resist and fight for the Amazon. Art is a powerful form of activism, struggle and resistance, and it is an honor for us to participate in a project like this”, said the expert. Where has all this resistance gone now that Lula is president? During the last electoral campaign, one of the main issues raised by the left was environmental issues and the protection of indigenous people, but as with many other things, it was yet another failure. The number of Yanomami deaths in 2023 was higher than that of 2022. Earlier this month, the newspaper “Estadão” announced that the Lula government would erase data on indigenous deaths. Nothing that seems to worry progressive singers either. Minister Marina Silva, now forced to appear more often due to the fire crisis, has already blamed climate change, human actions, and El Niño. He even blamed the previous administration for the record deforestation during the PT government, but before supporting and joining the PT there weren't so many people to blame. The target was just one. As always, according to the left, nothing bad that happens when they are in power is their fault, always someone else's. In 2020, Lula questioned where the armed forces were to try to combat the fires in the Pantanal and the Amazon, and stated that the then Minister of the Environment was a characterless citizen with no respect for nature. I am still waiting for the moment when you criticize yourself and your current minister for what is happening. With deforestation or fires, dead jaguars or charred alligators, indigenous people being killed or committing suicide, the artists, who loved to appear so much in previous years, did not have the courage to take a stand now, confirming that the concern was not with nature but with the pet politician.

448,PT_160.txt,"Too much sunlight and heat reduce mental abilities: here are the results of a study

Science, in numerous studies published in the literature, has amply demonstrated how excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion or heatstroke, as the body's internal temperature rises dangerously. A new study shows that the scorching sun can have an impact on the brain even when the body temperature remains normal, without excessive temperatures. The investigation

Supported by the EU-funded HEAT-SHIELD project, the team behind the research suggests that the actual effect of prolonged exposure to sunlight on temperature and brain function has not been fully explored in previous investigations. ""Acute exposure did not affect performance parameters, while prolonged exposure of the head and neck resulted in a 1ºC increase in core temperature and significant changes in controlled cognitive performance and motor activities,"" says the study published in the journal Scientific Reports. ""Importantly, the deficiencies emerged at significantly lower levels of hyperthermia compared to previous experiments,"" he adds. Cognition refers to the mental skills and processes involved in acquiring and processing information necessary for everyday life. It includes memory, cognition, attention, reasoning, problem solving and understanding. The consequences of hyperthermia

Hyperthermia, even of short duration, can lead to cognitive impairment, negatively affecting attention, memory and information processing. These results underscore the importance of including the effect of radiative heat from sunlight on the head and neck in future scientific assessments of the impacts of heat stress and of specific head protection to minimize harmful effects. What is the impact of heat stress? According to Professor Lars Nybo, co-author of the study, ""the decrease in cognitive performance was observed at 38.5 degrees, that is, at a body temperature one degree lower than that demonstrated by previous studies, which represents a substantial difference "". Co-author Andreas Flouris, associate professor at the University of Thessaly and project partner, highlights the need to mitigate health and performance deteriorations induced by heat stress, intensified by global warming. The expert emphasizes that people who work or carry out daily activities outdoors should protect their heads from sunlight. ""The ability to maintain concentration and avoid attenuation of motor and cognitive performance is certainly important for safety at work and in traffic, as well as minimizing the risk of error during other daily activities."" The impact of solar radiation on climate change

The researchers conclude that the harmful effects of solar radiation must be taken into account in future studies that analyze the current effects of atmospheric or climate changes on health at work. For the purposes of the study, researchers tested the mental abilities of eight men, ages 27 to 41, as they worked on computers with direct exposure to heat from light bulbs aimed at their heads and backs.",0,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""The warmer the ocean, the more energy is available to the atmosphere to be able to develop these very deep depressions with significant impacts."" And as ""the ocean is very slow"", the consequences extend over time. Portugal has “physical conditions for storms to increase in frequency and amplitude”. Storm Ciarán, which arrived in Europe as a bomb cyclone, is not the first of its kind to hit Portuguese soil, but it is likely that phenomena like this will become more frequent. Furthermore, the weekend should bring another storm, which already has a name - Domingos. Geophysicist and former president of the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA) Miguel Miranda warns, in statements to CNN Portugal, about the scale of the storms in question. “It is very interesting from a physical point of view but very alarming from a social point of view”, he highlights, noting that in the most affected countries, such as France, winds of 200 km/h were recorded, a highly significant value and which is extremely rare. on European soil. Miguel Miranda explains that, mainly due to global warming - which will cause a warming of the oceans -, it is natural for phenomena like this to occur with greater frequency and intensity. “The warmer the ocean, the more energy is available for the atmosphere to be able to develop these very deep depressions with significant impacts on buildings and people”, adds the geophysicist. And, although the worst is over, it is expected that several effects will still be noticed in the coming days, at least until the weekend. This is because “the ocean is very slow”, which causes the consequences to extend over time, even after the system that causes the storm has passed. “This leads to restrictions on the coast, especially because there is a second ocean storm this weekend that will make life difficult in coastal communities”, highlights Miguel Miranda. The expert, therefore, asks that people strictly comply with the recommendations of the IPMA, which issued a red warning for a large part of the coast, while also leaving an orange warning for at least the entire coast. “It is important to understand that we are going to have a new maximum in maritime unrest. When waves eight meters high are indicated, this means that 10% of the waves may be more than 16 meters. When there is a red warning issued by IPMA, it must be strictly complied with because the dangers that exist are many”, reiterates Miguel Miranda. Regarding the effects that these bomb cyclones can cause, Miguel Miranda says that “the Portuguese have some experience of tornadoes, systems from another dimension”, but warns of the impacts that wind and rain can have, especially in areas closer to the coastal. Just look at what happened in 1941, when IPMA records marked the first bomb cyclone on national soil. ""When winds reach speeds of this magnitude, they lift objects and destroy trees. The combined action of wind and rain is very impactful - large trees that fall in urban areas are capable of destroying homes and vehicles"", concludes the geophysicist.",0,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When you buy a plane ticket, do you choose to pay extra to offset carbon emissions? If the answer is “no”, you are not alone. Voluntary participation in offsetting schemes may be less than 3% of people. Instead, Lufthansa will introduce a mandatory “environmental cost surcharge” on flights from the EU, the UK, Norway or Switzerland from the beginning of 2025. This will add up to 72 euros to a long-haul first class ticket. On short- and medium-haul flights, it will be closer to 1 to 7 euros. The German airline is unlikely to be alone. Mandatory green surcharges are expected to be adopted by traditional airlines in particular. A number of environmental regulations are to blame, says Lufthansa. She cites EU requirements for jet fuel to include a blend of at least 2% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from next year, as well as changes to emissions trading schemes (ETS) in Europe. Air France-KLM laid the groundwork in 2022 by imposing a “SAF contribution rate”, charged at a lower level. Each regulatory change on its own is not outrageous. In fact, SAF, produced from a variety of materials including recycled cooking oil, is expected to cost at least double the long-term historical price of kerosene by 2050, according to a recent report from LEK Consulting. But suppose Lufthansa's 2025 fuel bill remains close to the €8.3 billion it forecasts for 2024, a quick calculation suggests that compliance with the 2025 EU mixing rules could cost another €17 million. Required mixing levels rise again in 2030 and 2035. Changes to the EU ETS scheme and similar programs elsewhere will be more expensive. Currently, polluters receive some free permits, but these are being reduced. The impact on traditional airlines will be greater, argues Goodbody analyst Dudley Shanley, as they have historically been larger emitters and tend to have less efficient fleets. This year, Lufthansa expects to receive free emission certificates for around 2.8 million tonnes of CO₂, compared to 3.8 million tonnes in 2023, according to its latest annual report. This reduction could cost 65 million euros, starting with BloombergNEF's forecast for an average price of 65 euros per ton of permitted EU emissions this year. They are expected to rise to €80/t in 2025. In good times, these costs could be absorbed. Lufthansa is expected to have a net profit in 2025 of almost 1.8 billion euros, according to figures from Visible Alpha. However, traditional airlines fight a perpetual war to reduce the huge cost gap with their low-cost competitors. Passengers may complain, but the baggage of mandatory environmental fees — at least among major airlines — could become the norm.",0,['CC: Criticism of climate policies'],['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other'],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In an evolved and democratized society, the ends do not justify the means. To defend the idea and fight the cause, it ceases to be acceptable to society when dialogue is not used in a civilized manner. By going for aggression, whatever modus operandi it may have, one will be clearly disrespecting the good practices that activism must implement with the objective consequence of the struggle and the fight for the idea not being understood, and therefore same reason it doesn't have the necessary strength it should. The recent events that led to the throwing of green paint at Minister Duarte Cordeiro, have, in my reading, a simple reason. Someone gradually feeds a group, radicalizing the issue of climate change. With dignity, Duarte Cordeiro continued his work, not dwelling on the controversy, stating that he understood the situation and others in the recent past. Activism, as we have seen it, with ramifications for the most radical policies, loses across the board. The debate gave way to the most original ways of showing themselves but with the sad premise of harming third parties. The trend of puncturing tires on specific brand cars just because is still very present in everyone's mind, and in the pockets of some. This is nothing. This is going deep into everything that is civilization and a society that wants to be modern in the debate of ideas. We will never evolve if activism in Portugal continues to present us with these sad spectacles that only diminish the power of dialogue in the search for solutions and points of convergence. The group “Greve Climática Estudantil”, which committed a public crime with its act, which for this reason does not need to be complained about, must realize that it is socially losing the fight, not because of the idea it defends, but because of the way it is defended, and we must all show our outrage at this group and so many others. No matter how respectable your fight and your conviction is from an ideological point of view, everything takes on a different perspective when you turn to aggression, because it is totally reprehensible. It is urgent to change the paradigm of thinking and action of activist groups. Their notorious “dangerousness” should not be the motto, but unfortunately that is how they show themselves. The right to expression is inalienable and intrinsic to human nature itself, but none of this can be confused with everything we see. With this episode, which hit Minister Duarte Cordeiro – lucky for the paint not to hit his eyes – the time has come to tell all activists to change. Be intelligent in your manner, be worthy in fighting your causes and stop violence once and for all. Yes, because we are talking about violence and its practice is counterproductive in our democratic rule of law.

In an interview with the international television network RT, Alexander Dugin quickly explained the geopolitical dimension of the Ukrainian conflict and the foundations of the multipolar world that is rising against the imperialist universalism of the West. The conflict in Ukraine is the world’s “first multipolar war,” in which Russia fights for the right of each civilization to choose its own path while the West wants to maintain its hegemonic totalitarian globalism, Aleksandr Dugin told RT in an exclusive interview on Friday. Multipolarity is not “against the West as such,” Dugin said, but “against the West’s claim to be the model, to be the unique example” of history and human understanding. Today’s Russophobia and hatred of Russia, he argued, are a relic of Cold War thinking and the “bipolar understanding of the architecture of international relations.” When the Soviet Union self-destructed in December 1991, it left the “Western global liberal civilization” in control of the world, Dugin noted. This hegemon now refuses to accept a future in which it would be “not one of two, but one of [a few] poles,” put in its rightful place as “only a part, not the whole, of humanity.” Dugin described the West as “pure totalitarian liberalism,” which pretends to have absolute truth and seeks to impose it on everyone. “There is racism inherent in Western liberalism,” the philosopher told RT’s Donald Courter, because it “identifies Western historical, political, cultural experience [as] universal.” “There is no universal in multipolarity,” Dugin insisted, explaining that each civilization can and should develop its own values. Russia specifically needs to overcome centuries of Western ideological dominance, he said, and create something “new, fresh, creative” that would nevertheless remain “in direct refutation of Western liberal hegemony, against the open society, against individualism, against liberal democracy.” He rejected the “dogmatic” attitudes of Marxism, fascism or liberalism toward politics and economics, saying that Russia should strive for a “holistic” approach, in which the spiritual would be more important than the material. Obsession with material goods ends up enslaving people, Dugin told RT. Dugin lamented the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 as a “suicide” perpetrated by power-hungry bureaucrats in Moscow. He echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s description of the event as a “geopolitical disaster” and described it as a great victory for “Sea Power.” While the USSR was the polar opposite of the Russian Empire in ideological terms, he explained, in geopolitical terms the two were one and the same, the strongest power in what the English geographer Harold Mackinder described as the global Heartland. While some Western observers have called Dugin “Putin’s brain,” the 60-year-old philosopher and author has no official ties to the Kremlin. He is an outspoken supporter of the current military operation in Ukraine—whose independence he sees as a Western imperial project against Russian sovereignty. Dugin’s daughter, Daria, just 29, was murdered in August by a car bomb set by Ukrainian agents.

In recent days, information has appeared on the network about attacks by Ukrainian Armed Forces UAVs on:

We note that, in accordance with Russia's National Security Strategy, in achieving the country's defense goals, special attention is paid to solving tasks, among which ""maintaining a sufficient level of nuclear deterrence potential"" stands out.

▪️Weakening of Russia's nuclear security

▪️Repeated testing of Russia's patience

▪️Russia's provocation to use tactical nuclear weapons

▪️In the absence of a firm reaction from Russia, creating conditions for further weakening of our strategic defense in the event of a direct conflict with NATO.

And nowhere does it say that these weapons should be designated as “tactical.” However, given the eternal delay in implementing retaliatory measures or their media-heavy nature, we are unlikely to see such actions in the near future.

Russia does not categorically reject participating in a future peace conference with Ukraine, but wants to first understand the framework of the meeting suggested this week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Kremlin responded this Tuesday to the proposal put forward the day before by Zelensky that Russia should be present at a second peace summit that could probably be scheduled for November. “The first peace summit was not a peace summit at all, so perhaps we first need to understand what he means,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said on Tuesday in an interview with the military channel Zvezda , quoted by the Moscow Times. Peskov was referring to the conference organized by Switzerland in June in the Alps, to which no Russian leaders were invited. At the time, this was a demand from Zelensky, who refused to sit at the table with representatives of the power that occupies part of Ukrainian territory. Moscow criticized the lack of invitation and several countries decided not to attend the conference, including China, Russia's main diplomatic ally. Other nations from the Global South that were present ended up not signing the final communiqué, dealing a blow to the ambitions of Kiev and its Western partners to present strong global support for Zelensky's peace plan. Despite the absence of an invitation to Russia at the Swiss summit, future participation of Russian representatives in future meetings was never excluded. Still, it is difficult to understand what could bring the positions of the two countries closer together in possible talks. Ukraine demands Russia's immediate military withdrawal from occupied territories, while Moscow wants recognition of the annexations of the four provinces it partially occupies.

This week, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmitry Kuleba traveled to New Delhi to seek support from the world's most populous nation, seeking to deepen ties with countries in the Global South as Ukraine faces a critical moment on the battlefield. In an interview with the Financial Times, the foreign minister urged the Indian government to support Kiev, saying that close ties between India and Russia are based on a ""Soviet legacy"". The foreign minister's visit is the first by a senior Ukrainian official to India since the Russian operation in Ukraine began. ""Cooperation between India and Russia is largely based on the Soviet legacy. But this is not the legacy that will be preserved for centuries; it is a legacy that is evaporating,"" he said. Kuleba also made a provocative connection by linking the friendship between Moscow and Beijing with what China supposedly means to India today. ""The Sino-Russian relationship should be of special concern to India in light of its national security prerogatives."" Going further with his arguments to convince New Delhi, Kuleba cited that when the conflict ends, Ukraine ""will probably become the largest construction site in the world and Indian companies are welcome to participate in the recovery."" Kiev is now seeking to “restore trade” with India, the minister said, by resuming exports of agricultural products such as sunflower oil and buying more Indian products itself: “We are interested in importing some of the heavy machinery items that India produces,” he added. Ukraine has struggled to win the favor of India and many other countries in the Global South. These states have largely avoided taking sides in a conflict that they consider “the business of rich nations” and whose economic price they have paid in trade disruptions and higher costs, the media reported. Despite Kuleba’s statements that ties between Moscow and New Delhi are “evaporating,” Russia remains India’s largest arms supplier. The Indian state has also become a major buyer of Russian crude oil following the Russian operation in Ukraine, and India shares with Moscow (along with China and Brazil) the original founding of the BRICS. Media reports have previously reported that Kuleba claimed that every barrel of Russian crude oil purchased by India contained “a good portion of Ukrainian blood.” However, Kiev has sought to smooth relations with New Delhi as it tries to win over more countries to its cause, the Financial Times writes.",0,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The end of the confrontation between Moscow and Kiev must be accompanied by the elimination of the threat that the West poses to Russia's security, said the head of Foreign Affairs during an open debate at the Security Council convened by his delegation, which chairs that entity this month. Lavrov insisted that both his country and the West need mutual guarantees and agreements, in a clear allusion to the need to reach an agreement for the security of both. At the same time, he considered it necessary to take into account the new geostrategic realities on the Eurasian continent, where a new, truly equal and indivisible continental security architecture is being formed. In this context, he added, Europe runs the risk of falling behind in this objectively historic process. “We are ready to seek a balance of interests,” he further said. The global and regional balance of power must also be restored, along with redressing injustices in the global economy, the senior diplomat added. Russia's Foreign Minister rejected the use of these coercive measures in a multipolar world that, in his opinion, should have no monopoly on financial or monetary regulation, trade or technologies. Regarding American policy, the head of Russian diplomacy warned that Washington is convinced that a new global war will not affect the United States, but its European allies. “If this analysis forms the basis of the (Joe) Biden administration’s strategy, it is a very dangerous mistake, and Europeans should realize that they have been assigned a suicidal role”, he added before the members of the highest body for peace on the planet. At the same time, it demanded more attention from national minorities to resolve the conflict on Ukrainian territory. “We ask all those who show a sincere interest in overcoming the crisis in Ukraine to consider in any of their proposals the fundamental issue of the rights of national minorities.

The study, published on Saturday in the scientific journal Scientific Reports, from the Nature group, analyzed “an unprecedented set of data” collected over a year in caves in various parts of the globe, from subarctic to tropical regions, including in Portugal , caves in the center of the country, in the Algarve and the Azores. Over the course of a year, every two hours the temperature was measured in caves and on the surface, totaling more than 100,000 measurements, which “demonstrate that the temperature in the caves corresponds to the average annual surface temperature for each location”, said Ana Sofia Reboleira , Professor at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon and researcher at the Center for Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Changes, to the Lusa agency. According to the biologist “the caves responded with three different patterns”: one in which the variation in external temperature is reflected in the cave with a small delay, another in which the temperatures on the surface are quickly reflected inside and, a third in which they work in a mirror, the lower the temperature on the surface, the higher inside the cave and vice versa. More surprising was the discovery of “the existence of daily thermal cycles in some caves”, considered by the researcher “particularly interesting because in ecosystems with a total absence of light, organisms lack circadian rhythms, that is, biological rhythms marked by the natural cadence of day and night controlled by sunlight on the surface.” This discovery “shows that these daily thermal cycles can potentially control the biological rhythms of underground organisms”, a hypothesis that appears for the first time in the history of Biology. “These ecosystems are inhabited by unique species that play a very important role in what scientists call ecosystem services” since, he explained, “it is these animals that guarantee the deep recycling of nutrients, of some contaminants that get there, that control the bacterial growth and other types of problems that can affect us.” In the case of organisms adapted to low amplitudes and reduced thermal variability, the increase in temperatures by several degrees, due to climate change, “will certainly affect these organisms responsible for guaranteeing the good ecological status of these underground water bodies”, which represent 97 % of total freshwater resources available for immediate human consumption. Among the caves covered in the study, the scientist highlights the case of one in Loulé that recorded the highest temperature on the surface, with more than 39 degrees, and another in the Azores, with the greatest thermal amplitude, with a variation of 8.8, explained due to the fact that it is a volcanic cave. The impact of climate change, combined with the fact that underground ecosystems “are constantly neglected in political and public agendas”, lead researchers to now move forward with laboratory studies “on the effects of rising temperatures on these organisms” aiming to estimate the maximum temperatures that these will be able to handle it.

Family doctor points out measures that can be taken to minimize the effect of extreme temperatures, but draws attention to the lack of public policies to adapt to climate change. Brazil began the last week of winter facing an extreme heat wave. An atmospheric blockage has prevented the arrival of the cold fronts common for the season and has promised temperatures above 40º C in several regions, mainly in the Central-West and Southeast. The effects of this temperature spike can go beyond mere discomfort. It is possible to develop hyperthermia and heatstroke, which can even cause death – especially among more vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly. Can you die from the heat?

In an interview with Natuza Nery, family and community doctor Mayara Floss explains that measures can be taken to minimize the effect of extreme temperatures, and also draws attention to the lack of public policies to adapt to climate change. ""Regions, for example, of favelas, regions that have few trees – where there are vast monocultures... These demographic factors put these populations at risk,"" he says. To mitigate the effects of heat on a daily basis, Mayara mentions measures such as: carrying a lighter change of clothes to use on public transport during rush hour; placing a bottle of ice-cold water to cool areas of the body, such as the armpits; if possible, prioritise working hours early in the morning, avoiding times of greatest temperature rises; keeping the house more ventilated during the night and more closed during the day.",0,"['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Pantanal, one of the largest wetlands on the planet, is facing an unprecedented environmental crisis. The combination of deforestation and prolonged droughts has led to an alarming reduction in the water surface, affecting not only local biodiversity, but also the communities that depend on these natural resources. A recent study by the MapBiomas platform highlights that, in the current century, almost every year there has been a decrease in the water surface in Brazil, with the Pantanal and Cerrado being the most affected biomes. Experts warn of the risk of severe drought and a possible water collapse, a direct consequence of the neglect of springs and riverside forests, essential for the percolation of rain into the land and for maintaining the flow of rivers. Deforestation in the Amazon, which affects rainfall formation through evapotranspiration, also contributes significantly to drought in the Pantanal, creating ideal conditions for the spread of devastating fires. These fires, in turn, further compromise soil structure and reduce the amount of water available in the water table. The situation is aggravated by the fact that the Pantanal has lost 29% of its water surface, and 57% of its territory has been burned at least once in the last 36 years. This loss not only signals a decline in the health of the biome, but also reflects the profound climate changes that are occurring on a global level. The low water of the Paraguay River, which records levels close to historic lows, is yet another indicator of the seriousness of the situation. The impact of these changes goes beyond environmental degradation, also affecting the economy and society, with damages that overlap and amplify the challenges faced by the region. It is imperative that measures are taken to mitigate these effects and protect the Pantanal for future generations. Raising awareness about the importance of ecosystem services provided by biomes such as the Pantanal and the Amazon is a crucial step in this process. The preservation of these ecosystems is not just a matter of nature conservation, but a necessity for the sustainability of our own way of life.

This led him, a year ago, to walk the red carpet at the Cannes Festival, and last March to Belém, where the French president, Emmanuel Macron, accompanied by his Brazilian colleague, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, presented him with the insignia of the Legion of Honor. And now a new opportunity has been offered to him by Pope Francis, who wanted him among the protagonists of the international summit “From the climate crisis to climate resistance”, which was held at Casina Pio VI, in Vatican City. Evoking the meeting he had with the Pontiff, Raoni told ANSA: “I asked him to make it clear to the Catholics who follow him in Brazil what the Church's orientation is on environmental issues, because sometimes they seem not to have understood the message”. Speaking in the language of the Mebengokre indigenous people, Raoni highlighted that “a void is being progressively created around our lands in the Amazon and there is nothing truly protected anymore”. “We live almost on islands and, as if that were not enough, there are people who are not satisfied, who want to attack even the reserves where we live, putting our survival at risk.” “What is happening?

Focusing on indigenous lands, Raoni recalled that, ""when Lula became president, he promised me that he would clearly demarcate them"". ""I am still waiting for that to happen. Of course, we have better relations with his government than when Jair Bolsonaro was in power. But right now for us there are many words, but few actions"". Addressing the large group of experts who listened to him and who at the end of the presentation gave him a standing ovation at the summit, Raoni argued that ""the developed world seems convinced of the urgency of the fight against climate change"". “But now we need to decide to immediately finance the tools to start the necessary projects, before it is too late.

Renowned French philosopher Nostradamus’s prophecies for 2024 have been revealed, bringing with them worrying news about what the coming year could hold for the world. Nostradamus, whose accurate predictions have included historical events such as the rise of Adolf Hitler and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, released his visions of the future in the book Les Prophéties more than 450 years ago. His words have been seen as a ‘warning’ of what is to come. One of the most alarming predictions suggests that King Charles could face difficult times in 2024. Although the text does not mention a specific king, it is speculated that it refers to the current leader of the British monarchy. Analysts have interpreted Nostradamus’ words as a possible abdication scenario due to persistent attacks on the king and his second wife, Queen Camilla. In another intriguing prediction, Nostradamus foresees an imminent naval conflict, indicating that a “red enemy” will turn pale with fear, putting the ocean in a state of apprehension. Many believe this red enemy is communist China, suggesting a possible confrontation in the Indian Ocean. In addition, Nostradamus warns of disasters related to climate change. He predicts that the Earth will become increasingly arid, resulting in floods and rising sea levels as ice caps melt. The mystic warns of a possible famine due to the pestilential waves, indicating the possibility of a tsunami that would threaten crops. The future of the Catholic Church: election of a new Pope

Nostradamus also makes a prediction related to the Catholic Church, suggesting that Pope Francis could die in 2024. Turning 88 in December, the Pope could be replaced by an “elderly Roman” after his death. Although there are several potential candidates, the choice will be made between cardinals under the age of 80.

What happened 53 million years ago? These scientists discovered that, around 50 million years ago (more precisely between 53 and 49 million years ago), almost all marine plankton, that is, all aquatic plants and animals that are drifting with the currents, moved to the highest latitudes, between the Antarctic Circle and the South Pole. This surprising change preceded by several million years a mass extinction of marine species in the ocean. What is even more worrying is that during this Eocene period, between 53 and 49 million years ago, there was a ""climatic optimum"", that is, a period of ""persistently high"" global temperatures that is curiously reminiscent of today. Climatologists are inevitably very concerned, since this ""Eocene climate optimum"" is close to the most pessimistic global warming scenarios currently being studied. It is clear that plankton must be subject to close scrutiny at this time, as the slightest change could mean the same disastrous scenario as in the Eocene, with a mass extinction of species.

Of course, the study authors explain that the past is never a mirror of the future and that it is only a correlation between the movement of plankton and the disappearance of species, and is in no way a causal relationship. However, they believe the plankton could act as a warning before a supposed wave of extinctions of larger marine species. Study co-author Dr. Adam Woodhouse (Bristol), however, describes the result as ""exciting"", adding that observation of plankton could constitute an ""early warning system"" to predict the extinction of life in the oceans.

The majestic Perito Moreno Glacier, one of the icons of the Argentine Patagonia landscape, is sending a warning signal to the world. Located in Los Glaciares National Park, this ice giant, with its impressive 250 square kilometers in area and an average of 60 meters in height, is more than a natural wonder. It is a testament to the power of nature and, more recently, the urgent need for collective action for the environment. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981, the glacier is part of the third largest body of continental ice on the planet, second only to Antarctica and Greenland. In other words, its grandeur and beauty act as an unmistakable reminder of indomitable nature. However, researchers at the Argentine Institute of Nivology and Glaciology have been observing the signs of imminent changes with increasing concern. A group of experts has dedicated themselves to studying the effects of climate change on the Perito Moreno Glacier. And, according to the results, since 2021, the glacier has retreated by around 700 meters on the north bank of the Los Témpanos Channel. This retreat surprised the scientific community, since, until then, the glacier went against regional trends by exhibiting stability, with little evidence of melting or significant retreat. Influence of climate change

The explanation for this setback lies in the climate changes that have been occurring on the planet. Rising temperatures resulted in accelerated melting of the glacier and the detachment of ice blocks. Furthermore, the lack of precipitation resulting in snow accumulation also plays a crucial role in this scenario, among other issues. Such a scenario not only affects the delicate balance of the region's ecosystem, but also directly impacts tourism in the area. The hiking experience to the Perito Moreno Glacier has already been affected, and the trekking route must be readjusted due to changes in the glacier's geography. It is in this context that Patagonia Experience Travel, an agency specialized in travel in the Patagonian region, highlights the importance of embracing sustainable tourism as a way of uniting human beings in favor of mitigating the effects of climate change. The agency's CEO, Jefferson Gonzalez, who has served as ambassador for the Patagonian region in Brazil for 13 years, highlights that it is essential to make people aware of the consequences of climate change so that this natural wonder is preserved for future generations. “We need to join forces to combat climate change, ensuring that, in a few decades, we will still have the privilege of contemplating these glacial formations,” says Gonzalez.",0,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""More than 1,100 civilians were injured and more than 200 people were killed,"" Viacheslav Gladkov told the Russian news agency TASS about the casualties caused by Ukrainian drone and artillery strikes on the region. The Belgorod region shares a 540-kilometer border with Ukraine and is the Russian Federation entity most affected by Ukrainian military actions. According to data from local authorities provided last April, more than 120 civilians had been killed in the region as a result of Ukrainian attacks since the beginning of the war. In recent weeks, attacks on this Russian region, which borders the Ukrainian provinces of Sumy, Kharkiv and Lugansk from west to south, the latter of which was annexed by Russia in September 2022, have intensified. The Russian military offensive on Ukrainian territory, launched on 24 February 2022, has plunged Europe into what is considered the most serious security crisis since the Second World War (1939-1945). Ukraine has been relying on financial and weapons aid from its Western allies, who have also imposed sanctions on key sectors of the Russian economy in an attempt to reduce Moscow's ability to finance the war effort. Recent months have been marked by large-scale Russian airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, while Kiev's forces have targeted targets in Russian territory near the border and on the Crimean peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014. Now in the third year of war, the Ukrainian armed forces have been struggling with a shortage of soldiers and weapons and ammunition, despite repeated promises of help from Western allies, which have now begun to materialize.",0,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Russian President's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Ukraine should take into account the drastic changes in the country's borders since the start of the special military operation in the peace negotiations. Increasingly abandoned by the West, the country has accumulated significant losses in recent months. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said in an interview with CBS News that returning to the 1991 borders was no longer a prerequisite for negotiations with Russia. However, the Ukrainian still insisted that Kiev should regain the territory lost to Moscow by 2022. That year, four former Ukrainian regions — Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye — voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in a public referendum. The population followed suit in the Crimean peninsula, which did the same in 2014. After the 2022 referendums, Zelensky banned all talks with the current Russian leadership, focusing instead on a formula for ending the conflict that requires a complete withdrawal of Moscow’s forces from all of the aforementioned territories. While Russia claims to be open to talks with Kiev, it has dismissed Zelensky’s idea as “detached from reality.” Regarding Zelensky's statements, Peskov told Sputnik on Saturday (30) that ""the geopolitical reality has changed dramatically since the beginning of the special military operation. The borders of both Ukraine and the Russian Federation have changed."" The spokesman also commented that Russia has already incorporated the four former Ukrainian regions, stressing that this reality ""cannot be ignored."" Meanwhile, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said that Zelensky's change of position is due to the fact that he is ""nervous."" ""He has an election coming up. Or is there no election?"" she asked. The Ukrainian president has previously indicated that he has no plans to authorize a vote, citing martial law, which has drawn criticism both at home and abroad. Zelensky’s remarks followed a statement by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba, who said Kiev could engage with Moscow at some point after a summit in Switzerland later this year that is widely expected to revolve around Zelensky’s peace formula. Russia has said it does not plan to attend the event, even if it is officially invited.",0,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Company says demand will be driven by wide-body planes

Airbus revised upwards, this Monday, its demand forecast for aircraft for the next 20 years, according to Reuters. According to the agency, which cites an annual report on industry trends, the global fleet could reach 48,230 planes in the next 20 years, meaning it could more than double. According to the document, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer predicted the delivery of 42,430 new planes over the next 20 years, including 41,490 passenger planes, with a 4% increase in both figures since the previous study. The report comes at a time when the aircraft maker's long-range, single-aisle A321XLR is expected to achieve certification in the coming days. Boeing - which has been involved in several controversies in recent times - is developing a long-range version of the 737 MAX. Airbus' forecasts are based, according to Reuters, on economic forecasts that suggest that 1.7 billion people will enter the middle class, with some disposable income to travel by plane, in the next 20 years. ""We foresee particularly strong growth in Asia and the Middle East, led mainly by India and China. China’s domestic traffic will overtake that of the United States,” said Bob Lange, head of market analysis and forecasting at Airbus. The Airbus data highlighted the shift in focus to India, with three of the fastest-growing traffic flows serving the Indian subcontinent.

472,PT_30.txt,"Analyst: Western elite used Ukraine as 'guinea pig for human testing' after 2014 coup

When carrying out human trials, big pharmaceutical companies did not think twice about using hospitals in certain developing countries, without ""strict controls"" for such actions, William Jones, former White House correspondent and non-resident fellow at the Institute, told Sputnik Chongyang for Financial Studies. Recently, Sputnik obtained a series of documents indicating that rheumatological drugs were allegedly tested for several years on psychiatric patients in a hospital in the city of Mariupol, at the request of large Western pharmaceutical companies and with the assistance of Ukrainian authorities. The documents contain information belonging to companies such as Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Celltrion, Novatris International AG, Merck KGaA and a subsidiary of Samsung that produces medical equipment. The tests were carried out while the Kiev government held Mariupol, until May 2022, when Russia took control of the city. Patients in the psychiatric ward of Mariupol hospital № 7 were likely used as vulnerable ""guinea pigs"" in experiments that would not have been allowed in the countries where these pharmaceutical companies are located, said William Jones, former White House correspondent for Executive Intelligence Review and non-resident fellow at Chongyang Institute of Financial Studies, Renmin University of China, told Sputnik. ""In general, it has been the practice to use some of the developing countries that don't have as tight controls for this type of experiment,"" Jones noted, alluding to Ukraine. After the Maidan coup in Kiev in 2014, the country ""effectively became a 'guinea pig' for whatever experiments the forces of Western elites had in store for them, as we see most dramatically in the way the 'nation' of Ukraine is being reduced to nothing because of NATO's proxy war against Russia"", according to the expert. He also addressed the issue of ""the extensive network of biological laboratories that have been created in Ukraine over the 20 years, largely with the help, and no doubt at the request, of the United States"", something that Jones recalled was repeatedly pointed out by the Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, head of the Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops of the Russian Ministry of Defense. ""Given the current situation in Ukraine, with the growing realization that Ukraine — or NATO — cannot 'win' this conflict using conventional weapons, as well as NATO's determination not to accept a peaceful resolution unless Russia is defeated, could very well lead to NATO using some form of biological warfare to 'level the playing field,'"" warned Jones. In the spring of 2022, Russia's Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops brought light to the alarming scope of US biomilitary activities taking place in several locations in Ukraine. These investigations revealed collaboration between Washington and Kiev in the investigation and treatment of several highly dangerous pathogens.

In November 2022, a Dutch court found Russians Igor Guirkin and Sergei Dubinski and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko ""guilty"" of intentional homicide and sentenced them to life in prison. Magistrates found they were responsible for transporting the missile that brought down the plane from a base in Russia to the launch site, although they were not charged with firing it. The three men refused to take part in the Dutch trial, which convicted them in absentia, and denied any responsibility. A fourth suspect, Russian Oleg Pulatov, was acquitted. International investigators concluded there was ""strong evidence"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the delivery of the missile that brought down the plane. Moscow denies any involvement and has vehemently rejected the court’s 2022 verdict as “political” and “scandalous.” The European Union urged Moscow on Tuesday to “accept its responsibility for this tragedy and to cooperate fully in the service of justice.” Evidence presented during the trial “clearly shows that the BUK surface-to-air missile system used to shoot down flight MH17 undoubtedly belonged to the armed forces of the Russian Federation,” EU foreign minister Josep Borrell said.

The mosquito, known for black and white stripes along its body and legs, can transmit a number of tropical diseases , including dengue, zika and chikungunya. What are the symptoms of West Nile disease? The symptoms of the disease are similar to those of the flu (such as fever, body aches and headache), rash and feeling unwell. Others may experience muscle weakness, confusion, vision loss, numbness, stiff neck, diarrhea and seizures. What is the treatment for West Nile disease? Treatment usually involves rest, hydration, and over-the-counter pain relievers.

Heat is expected to make human life impossible in at least five regions of the Earth in the next 50 years, including Brazil, according to a study by the US Space Agency (NASA). The research found that rising temperatures combined with high levels of air humidity can cause thermal effects to which the human body would not be able to adapt. The emission of greenhouse gases has a direct impact on nature, with increasingly accelerated and severe climate change across the planet. Rising temperatures make unseasonal heat waves more frequent and winters less intense or shorter than usual. According to NASA, the body's cooling process occurs through perspiration, that is, sweat. Rising temperatures combined with humidity increase the sensation of heat and prevent sweat from evaporating, which keeps the body warm – and can be fatal. The study indicates that temperatures above 37ºC – a mark exceeded in many regions of Brazil during the summer – with air humidity equal to or greater than 70% can cause premature death after up to six hours of exposure. The body can still sweat at temperatures of 45ºC and up to 20% air humidity. However, research projects that with the thermometer at the same brand and a humidity level above 40%, the thermal sensation can exceed 71ºC and be lethal. Although the combination of these factors is considered rare, as hot days are characterized by drier air, the study found that since 2005 the phenomenon has been observed in regions of the Persian Gulf and Pakistan. In this scenario, NASA considered the trend of increasing thermometers in the coming decades, with climate change driven by the emission of greenhouse gases, and concluded that human life may be threatened in areas of the Midwest, North, Northeast and Southeast.

One of the most important events of the long period of civil war in Ukraine that preceded the Russian invasion of 2022, the downing of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 in the east of the country, completes ten years this Wednesday (17) marked by impunity. ""Who fired the missile? Who gave the order?"", asked in a video message the president of the foundation for the families of the 298 victims of the incident, the Dutchman Piet Ploeg. He lost his brother, sister-in-law and nephew on the flight. An international investigation, which was able to collect the wreckage of the plane, reached several consensuses. First, that the anti-aircraft missile had been fired from a Soviet-made Buk system. Second, more controversial, that the weapon had been launched from territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine. In 2022, a Dutch court, the country of birth of 193 of those killed while flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur (capital of Malaysia), sentenced three people to life imprisonment ""in absentia"" for more general involvement in the downing: Russians Igor Girkin and Sergei Dubinski, as well as Ukrainian Leonid Khartchenko. All operated with separatist forces in the region and, according to the version of the European country's justice system, had worked to bring, use and then return the Buk to a Russian base in the region across the border. The case was closed in 2023, but the Netherlands filed a complaint against Russia at the European Court of Human Rights, directly accusing President Vladimir Putin of authorising the operation. Separately, the International Civil Aviation Agency is still investigating responsibility, with a view to possible civil proceedings. The Kremlin denies all accusations, saying the trial was a Russophobic farce typical of the turbulent times in Europe. From the beginning of the investigation, the Russians tried to shift the blame to Ukraine. First, they suggested that the missile that shot down the Boeing had been launched by a Kiev fighter jet. Then, they suggested that a Ukrainian anti-aircraft system had been responsible for the tragedy. With ties with the European Union cut off due to the 2022 invasion, the chances of an agreed solution are nil. The then Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, a harsh critic of Putin, will now be the secretary general of NATO (the Western military alliance). All three convicted men live in Russia and will not be extradited — the most notorious of them, Girkin, fell from grace for criticizing Putin's handling of the war and was sentenced to four years in prison this year for ""inciting extremism."" For the victims' families, all that remains is doubt. ""We will not rest until the truth is revealed,"" Ploeg said in the video. Over the years, the report has heard versions of what might have happened from people with access to security information in Moscow. The most likely scenario, they say, was an operational error on the part of the separatists, who mistook the Boeing on the Buk's radar for a Ukrainian plane. When news of the plane's downing arrived, the initial reaction was one of shock and particular disbelief, given that Malaysia had lost an identical plane in the mysterious case of flight MH370, which had disappeared four months earlier after taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing with 239 people on board — a case that remains unsolved to this day. But the reality on the ground would soon set the tone for the outrage over what had happened. Between late 2013 and early 2014, the pro-Russian government in Kiev faced protests and was overthrown. Putin responded by annexing Crimea and inciting a civil war in the Donbass, a region that includes the Donetsk and Lugansk areas. For Ukrainian filmmaker Marina Er Gorbach, who used the downing of the plane as a backdrop for her award-winning ""Klondike"" (2023), the episode was the first warning shot about the gravity of the crisis and yet it ended up being ignored in the West. In an interview with Folha last year, she said that the sanctions applied to Moscow in 2014 were too lax, leading to the escalation of the civil war, which killed around 14,000 people, and the full invasion eight years later. The trauma of the unfinished episode has spread throughout the commercial aviation industry.

Russia, excluded from the Paris 2024 Olympic Games due to its offensive against Ukraine, said this Saturday (27) that the opening ceremony of the sporting event was a ""big failure"", while the Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, declared that the party reflected the ""fragility and disintegration of the West"". Russian diplomacy spokeswoman Maria Zakharova highlighted on Telegram what she considered to be flaws in the show, which took place on Friday (26) on the River Seine. ""I hadn't planned on seeing the opening. But after seeing the photos, I couldn't believe it wasn't a 'deep fake' or photoshop,"" he wrote on Telegram. The ceremony was not shown live on Russian television. Zakharova cited, among other points, the ""collapse of transport"", after the French railway network suffered acts of sabotage, and ""spectators sat for hours in heavy rain"". ""The organizers didn't think about cloud dispersal or awnings,"" he added, referring to the Russian practice of sending planes ahead of large outdoor events to try to break through the clouds. Zakharova also said that central Paris had been ""turned into a ghetto for homeless people"" and that ""rats had flooded the streets"" of the capital. The spokesperson particularly criticised the presence of drag queens at a point during the ceremony, whose performance was reminiscent of the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with his apostles. “In Paris, they decided that if the Olympic rings are multi-coloured, they can turn the whole thing into a giant gay march,” she added. Only 16 Russian athletes accepted the invitation from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to participate in the event under a neutral flag. In Hungary, Orban said that the spectacle showed the “emptiness” of the West. “They have gradually eliminated metaphysical ties, with God, homeland and family,” said the Hungarian head of government, adding that this has led to “the absence of public morality”.

A lawsuit filed by Ukraine in January 2017 made several accusations against Russia, holding it responsible for the attacks in Donetsk and the downing of Boeing MH17. On Wednesday (31), the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found the country not guilty. Following the verdict of the international court linked to the United Nations (UN), Russian Senator from Sevastopol Ekaterina Altabayeva told Sputnik that the decision is only the first step towards the truth about the situation in Ukraine. In a historic decision, the court did not give in to Kiev's demands, which essentially asked for Russia to be recognized as an ""aggressor state"" and the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) as ""terrorist organizations"". Most of Ukraine's claims against Russia in Crimea under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination were also rejected, ICJ President Joan Donoghue announced. ""In particular, this indicates that the time will come when the Ukrainian government will be assessed. This is the first step, and the assessment of the Ukrainian regime and the investigation of the crimes of certain politicians, members of terrorist organizations such as 'Azov' in Ukraine will take place; I am sure that this will happen in the foreseeable future. The senator also stressed that the court’s decisions “put Ukraine in its place.” “I believe this is an important signal to the international community; it says that it is necessary to objectively assess what is happening in Ukraine,” she added. Kiev’s accusations The case, initiated by Kiev in January 2017, addressed several issues, one of which was Russia’s responsibility for the downing of the Boeing MH17 plane. However, the court rejected this demand, finding Russia not guilty of the incident. In addition, the court did not support Ukraine’s arguments about Russia’s alleged involvement and the responsibility of the Donetsk militias in several attacks, including the shelling of the Bugas military checkpoint near Volnovakha; the military airfield in Kramatorsk; and the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Mariupol and Avdeevka, which occurred in the period from 2014 to 2017.

Workers from Texas to Ohio are benefiting from Washington's push to supply weapons to Kiev, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. The conflict in Ukraine is ""a boon to the U.S. economy"" as it has created more jobs in the U.S. military-industrial sector, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. Speaking at a White House Competition Council meeting on Tuesday (5), the Pentagon chief promised that Washington would continue to push for a stronger defense industry, especially in light of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Austin said U.S. military assistance to Kiev has not only ""saved lives"" and kept Ukraine in the fight, but has also strengthened the U.S. economy. ""These investments have expanded facilities and created jobs for American workers. And the weapons we send to Ukraine to help defend itself are made in the United States by American workers all across the country — from Texas to Ohio to Arizona,"" the official added. The conflict in Ukraine has also highlighted the need to improve military production, according to Austin, who emphasized coordination with Washington's allies. He also urged US lawmakers to adopt a national security package that would provide $60 billion (about €55 billion) to Kyiv. The bill remains stalled in Congress due to opposition from Republicans, who have demanded that the White House address the security crisis on the border with Mexico. The US has been Ukraine’s main military backer, providing Kyiv with about $45 billion (about R$223.1 billion) in weapons between January 2022 and January 2024, while total commitments have reached more than $70 billion (about €64 billion), according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Reports suggest that US pressure to arm Ukraine has put significant strain on the country’s own arsenals. While officials in President Joe Biden’s administration have maintained that most of the funding for Ukraine is being spent within the United States, some Republicans have criticized the White House for allocating taxpayer dollars to foreign countries rather than directly addressing domestic problems. According to a December poll by the Pew Research Center, 31% of Americans believe the United States is providing too much support to Ukraine, while 29% say the current level of assistance is about right. Russia has repeatedly denounced Western arms shipments to Ukraine, warning that they will only prolong the conflict. Russian Foreign Ministry official Maria Zakharova said in December that the US would likely continue to fuel the conflict in Ukraine into 2024 as long as it could withdraw funds from American taxpayers.",0,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The attack on a convoy of Ukrainian military equipment in the Donetsk People's Republic was carried out using short-range ballistic missiles. Crews of Patriot air defense systems supplied to Ukraine by the US, previously destroyed by Russian forces, were ""almost certainly"" eliminated, Forbes magazine reported. The media outlet reported that the ""persistence and good fortune"" of a Russian drone operator ""paid off on Saturday (9) when he located a Ukrainian convoy including at least two truck-mounted quadruple launchers for a Patriot surface-to-air missile battery"" in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). ""The Ukrainians lost up to 13 percent of their Patriot launchers that day,"" so ""the air over eastern Ukraine may have become much safer for the Russians,"" according to Forbes.

Data from the Russian Defense Ministry showed that the strike also destroyed an S-300 missile system of Ukrainian troops near the town of Pokrovsky in the DPR. The last time the Russian military struck a Patriot was in late February, when the system’s launcher, tractor, ammunition and transport vehicle were destroyed by high-precision weapons. In May 2023, the Russian Defense Ministry reported that its forces had destroyed a Patriot stationed in Kiev with a Kinzhal hypersonic missile. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced a successful strike on another Patriot two weeks later.

According to Russian data, the European Union (EU) has made recommendations to Ukraine that it is necessary to invest in the supply of long-range weapons to ""hit the heart of Russia"", Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday (16). During his speech at the Euromaidan: Ukraine's Lost Decade conference, Lavrov also said that Western instructors directly help direct Ukrainian troops' strikes at Russian targets, and the West is participating in the war against Russia. ""There is no doubt that the West has declared war on us, they do not even hide it. And although they say in every possible way that 'they are just arming Ukraine, and it is fighting for itself', everyone understands that this is a lie. He stressed that ""the most important thing in a war is strategies, and strategies are not in Kiev, but far away"". ""According to our data, the European External Action Service has made recommendations for Ukraine, which assume that the methods by which Ukraine is currently fighting will not be successful and Ukraine will lose. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on transferring weapons of even greater range to Ukraine, so that, as the European Union describes it, they will 'hit the heart of Russia', and thus once again sow confusion and panic and undermine the people's confidence,"" Lavrov said during his speech.

Cases of the use of US chemical weapons were recorded during the special military operation, the head of the Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defence Forces of the Russian Armed Forces, Igor Kirillov, said on Monday (19). According to him, two facilities in the US still store highly toxic reactive compounds that remained after the destruction of declared stockpiles of American chemical weapons. The US was supposed to complete the destruction of declared stockpiles of chemical weapons in 2007, but did so only in 2023, Kirillov noted in a statement. ""The United States still retains highly toxic compounds after the destruction of chemical agents at the facilities in Blue Grass (Kentucky) and Pueblo (Colorado),"" the Russian lieutenant general said. According to him, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have repeatedly used toxic substances against Russian soldiers. As an example, Kirillov cited the use, on August 19, 2022, of a toxic chemical that is an analogue of the chemical warfare agent B-Zet included in Annex 2 of the Biological and Chemical Weapons Convention (BWC). All documents at the disposal of the Russian Defense Ministry confirming the facts of violations by the United States and Ukraine of the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention have been handed over to the Russian Investigative Committee for making a procedural decision, he said. A similar substance, according to Kirillov, was discovered on January 28, 2024 during an operational search in a cache in the Melitopol region. ""The toxic substance was in vials with the inscription Biosporin in Ukrainian."" Kirillov noted that Kiev is developing a ""special chemical belt"" tactic, which involves detonating containers with hydrocyanic acid and ammonia during the advance of the Russian Armed Forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine use toxic compounds not only in the course of hostilities, but also for carrying out terrorist acts. For example, in August 2022, the head of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, was poisoned with ricin. On December 5, 2023, Leonid Pasechnik, the head of the administration of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), was seriously poisoned with phenolic compounds.

On yet another day of escalating rhetoric in the crisis between Russia and the West, aggravated by the war in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin's government threatened to deploy new nuclear weapons targeting Europe if the United States follows through on its plan to move long-range missiles to Germany. The spokesperson for this intention was Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who is responsible for nuclear negotiations and has taken the lead in the verbal sparring with NATO countries, the Western military alliance. He was deliberately vague in his speech to the Interfax news agency, without saying what this nuclear response would involve. In practice, it is already a given: there is no doubt that Russia has nuclear warheads in the western territory of Kaliningrad, between Lithuania and Poland, that can equip Iskander-M missiles, which from there can reach as far as Berlin. What matters in this case is the tension itself, already high with the succession of threats from both sides. During the NATO summit last week, the US announced that it would deploy Tomahawk cruise missiles, an offensive weapon, and SM-6 missiles, in a theoretical long-range air defence, on German soil from 2026. These weapons had been vetoed by a 1987 agreement between the Americans and the Soviets, which was later abandoned by Donald Trump in 2018. Paradoxically, if the Republican returns to power in this year's elections, the greatest possibility is of an accommodation with Putin. In fact, Russian Foreign Minister Serguei Lavrov praised the choice of Senator J.D. Win for the vice-president spot on the Trumpist ticket. The Republican is against aid to Ukraine in the war and shares Russian admiration for the autocratic Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán. The Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, was more restrained. ""We saw the statements. We need to separate pre-election rhetoric from statements made by authorities with powers. If we are going to talk about the possibility of resolving the conflict, let's be realistic."" On another front, the Kremlin criticized the idea floated by the European Union of creating its own defense arm, parallel to NATO. For spokesman Dmitri Peskov, this proves ""the militarization of the continent"" against Russia. He also stated that his country ""views with concern"" rumors that Romania and Bulgaria, countries in the alliance that border the Black Sea, may increase the concentration of warships in the region. Turkey is the main NATO member in those waters, but has a stance closer to Moscow. The Russian Foreign Ministry also played this card on Thursday, saying that the US military exercises with Armenia are aimed at destabilising the region as a whole, and are aimed at the Russians, Yerevan’s allies, the Iranians and the Turks – historical rivals of the Armenians. The alliance has already announced that it intends to open a representative office in Kiev in September, before the departure of its long-serving Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg. The Norwegian will hand over the baton to the Dutchman Mark Rutte after ten years. The implications of this facility being targeted by the Russians are clear. During a visit to a security conference in London, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky once again asked his Western partners for permission to use their long-range weapons against Russian air bases. The request has been denied by the US, which has allowed the use of its weapons against points in border regions involved in offensives against the Ukrainians, but that is all. Last week, President Joe Biden said it would be unthinkable to authorize attacks on cities or the Kremlin. Zelensky has sought to counter fears of escalation, potentially nuclear, by saying that all red lines set by the Russians have been crossed without much retaliation. He has also accused Orbán of treason. Close to Putin, the Hungarian is the current rotating president of the European Union and has used his position to promote what he calls a ""peacekeeping mission"", having spoken with both the Ukrainian and the Russian presidents and Trump. For Zelensky, this means betraying Kiev and its European allies. On the ground, Ukraine experienced another violent day. In the east of the country, the Russians took another village in their advance in the Donetsk region, and Zelensky's armed forces made a rare admission of retreat to spare their troops. On the other hand, military pressure on the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Putin in 2014 and the crown jewel of his project in the region, remains high. Ukraine said it attacked a Black Sea Fleet base with water and air drones early this morning, damaging facilities. The day before, Kiev had said that the last Russian warship in the fleet had been withdrawn from Crimea, where the military unit has been based since the 18th century.

The patrol vessel Neustrahimiy, the training vessel Smolniy, and support vessels — all from the Baltic Fleet — are scheduled to depart on Tuesday.

Tensions between the United States and Russia have risen since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and Russian naval activity — while routine in the Atlantic — has increased due to U.S. support for Ukraine, U.S. officials say.

The recent arrest of a Russian man for alleged ""destabilizing"" activities against the Paris Games highlights last-minute concerns among organizers that Moscow may try to disrupt the event, which begins next Friday (26). The man, born in 1984, was arrested at his home in Paris this week and is suspected of ""espionage with a foreign power to provoke hostilities in France"", the prosecutor's office said last Tuesday (23). Le Monde newspaper reported that police found documents ""of diplomatic interest"" in his apartment, and that he is suspected of working for the Russian security service, the FSB, after appearing on reality TV shows and having worked for a time as a chef in a French ski resort. “We strongly believed that he would organize destabilization, interference, espionage operations,” French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin told BFMTV on Wednesday (24), pointing to a variety of clues: “It could be cyber attacks that require complicity, it could be information manipulation...”. The individual “is in the hands of justice, which could clarify the police’s suspicions,” explained the minister, commenting that the suspect’s presence on French soil is recent. - Campaign to discredit the Games -

Darmanin recalled that “other Russian individuals” had recently been arrested in the capital, and that the French authorities had been observing a disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the Paris Olympic Games. The minister recalled a very recent video on social media by an alleged representative of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, threatening France with attacks for hosting Israeli athletes, but which turned out to be fake content. “We believe that this is a fake video spread by accounts that, from what we see, are pro-Kremlin, pro-Russia,” the minister said, denouncing a “multiplicity” of maneuvers that could “cause damage to our country and raise concern.” Almost all Russian athletes were excluded from the Paris Games as a measure of diplomatic retaliation for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and only fifteen will participate under a neutral flag. Over the weekend, Darmanin revealed that French authorities had rejected a “large number” of requests from Russian citizens to be accredited as journalists to cover the Games, due to suspicions that they might actually be spies. Requests from Russian citizens to volunteer were also denied. Russia has denied involvement in any destabilisation operation against the Paris Games and said the refusal to grant accreditation to Russian reporters “violates press freedom”. In April, French President Emmanuel Macron said he had “no doubt” that Russia was targeting the organisation of the Olympic Games, “including the news sphere”.",0,['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the United States on Sunday that if Washington deploys long-range missiles in Germany, Russia would position similar missiles within striking distance of the West. The United States said on July 10 it would begin deploying long-range missiles in Germany from 2026, in preparation for a long-term deployment that will include SM-6s, Tomahawk cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons under development. In a speech to sailors from Russia, China, Algeria and India to mark Russian Navy Day in the former imperial capital of St. Petersburg, Putin warned the United States that it risked triggering a Cold War-style missile crisis with the announcement. ""The flight time to targets of such missiles on our territory, which in the future could be equipped with nuclear warheads, will be about 10 minutes,"" Putin said. ""We will take mirrored measures, taking into account the actions of the United States, its satellites in Europe and other regions of the world."" Putin, who sent his army to Ukraine in 2022, sees the war as part of a historic struggle with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 by invading what it considers to be Moscow's sphere of influence. Ukraine and the West say Putin is engaged in an imperial-style land grab. They have vowed to defeat Russia, which currently controls about 18 percent of Ukraine, including Crimea, and chunks of four regions in eastern Ukraine.

The French government intends to build an alliance with the Baltic nations (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) that agree to the proposal to send troops to fight Russia, according to an article published by the US edition of Politico. According to the article published this Saturday (9), the proposal was made by the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Stéphane Séjourné, during his meeting in Lithuania last Friday (8), with Baltic counterparts and the Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dmitry Kuleba. ""It is not up to Russia to organize how we should implement our actions or establish red lines. So we decide that between us"", declared the French minister, as reported by Politico. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron surprised many in Europe by saying that he does not rule out sending ground troops to Ukraine. Despite opposition to Macron's statement from most EU countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are much more open to the idea, the article said. On February 27, Macron said that Western leaders discussed the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine during a conference in Paris, but failed to reach a consensus. On 29 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned in his annual address to the Federal Assembly, the country's parliament, of the tragic consequences if this decision were to be implemented. Since 24 February 2022, Russia has been continuing a special military operation aimed at defending the Donetsk People's Republics (DPR) and Lugansk People's Republics (LPR), previously recognised by Moscow as sovereign states, against the genocide committed by Kiev, while addressing the risks to its national security posed by the advance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in Eastern Europe. Moscow has repeatedly warned that NATO is ""playing with fire"" by supplying weapons to Ukraine and that foreign arms shipments would be a ""legitimate target"" for Russia once they crossed the border.

After the protocol of Sweden's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) came into force this Thursday (7), with the inclusion of the European country, the military alliance led by the United States now has 32 members. The group's advance was one of the reasons that led to the special military operation in Ukraine. The measure has already provoked reactions from Russia, such as that of the senator from Kaliningrad, Aleksandr Shenderyuk-Zhidkov. In an interview with Sputnik, the parliamentarian stressed that the country will be forced to respond to the advance of the Western alliance, which has increasingly threatened international stability. ""Sweden's entry into NATO, of course, cannot but cause concern. Sweden has a very significant military force on the continent, and its neutrality for many years has ensured a balance of power both in the Baltic Sea and in Europe as a whole,"" said the politician. With this, the senator points out, Russia will not remain inactive and ""will be forced to respond to NATO's aggressive advance by reinforcing its Western military presence"". ""Our country has guaranteed the safety of navigation in the Baltic Sea for many centuries and will not allow its unilateral militarization"", the senator noted. Conflict between Russia and NATO

In recent weeks, statements have been made about a possible direct armed conflict between NATO and Russia, with the alliance's involvement in the fighting in Ukraine. In addition, Moscow has been warning for years about the organization's unprecedented increase in activity on its western borders and that this will not be ignored. Under the pretext of ""containing Russian aggression"", the country has repeatedly expressed its concern about the alliance's increase in forces in Europe. The Russian Foreign Ministry has stated that Moscow remains open to dialogue with NATO, but on equal terms, while the West should abandon the militarization of the continent. President Vladimir Putin, in an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson, explained in detail that Moscow has no intention of attacking NATO countries.

An investigative journalist has assessed the situation surrounding the Russian gas pipelines, whose investigation has already been abandoned by Sweden and Denmark, a move he sees as an attempt to hide the truth. On Monday (26), Denmark became the second European country to officially close its investigation into the explosion in the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines. Nord Stream has played a crucial role in supplying German industry and providing low-cost energy across Europe. Observers immediately blamed the United States for the event, which took place in September 2022, highlighting US President Joe Biden's enigmatic promise to ""put an end"" to the project if Russia deployed its troops in Ukraine in response to the oppression of the Russian-speaking population of Donbass. Denmark's inquiry found that the explosions were an act of ""deliberate sabotage,"" but authorities refused to investigate who was responsible. Earlier this month, Sweden closed its own investigation. ""It's an absolute farce,"" investigative journalist Dan Lazare said Wednesday (28). ""I don't know how much longer this can go on. I mean, Denmark investigated, came to a conclusion, and everyone knows it was obviously sabotage — that was obvious from the beginning. And [Denmark] refrains from pointing the finger at a likely culprit."" He said he is 100% convinced that ""the United States"" is to blame and that ""Denmark, Sweden, everyone is afraid to say that. It's extraordinary."" Lazare sees the situation benefiting far-right parties across the continent, such as the Alternative for Germany (AfD, in its German acronym), which are the only ones willing to openly recognize the US role in the act. "" So , if the AfD is rising in the polls, they have Joe Biden to thank, because Joe Biden blew up the gas pipeline, and everyone is afraid to admit it"", concluded Lazare, also citing Donald Trump in the USA, Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Giorgia Meloni in Italy. ""The center is destroying itself and is practically now introducing the far right to take its place,"" he said, predicting that the establishment's lawmakers ""will pay a terrible, terrible price for covering this up [ the Nord Stream sabotage]"". At the same time, he points out, ""the political consequences would have been dire"" if leaders publicly acknowledged US responsibility for the Nord Stream sabotage. ""When people admit what happened, NATO [the North Atlantic Treaty Organization] will basically go up in smoke, because an alliance is not a scheme for one member to attack another,"" he said. ""It is a mutual defense pact, and the US violated it on a massive scale. This [sabotage] of Nord Stream is an event that will have repercussions for decades. It is an explosion at the heart of the Western alliance — it will completely destroy the Western alliance.

498,PT_37.txt,"Ukraine cannot be discussed ‘without addressing NATO’s eastward expansion’, says US observer

Russia has repeatedly warned NATO against expanding into Eastern Europe, which the Kremlin says could further fuel tensions in Europe. US political commentator and podcaster Candace Owens stressed the importance of linking the conflict in Ukraine to NATO’s continued expansion towards Russia’s borders. “No serious person can discuss what happened in that region without addressing the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to the East, despite the promises made by our government officials that we would not do so after German reunification,” the observer wrote on her X account (formerly Twitter). Owens noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin “stated this reason in virtually every speech he made before and after” the start of Moscow’s special military operation. The remarks came after the Russian leader last year rebuked the US-led military bloc for repeatedly making ""empty promises"" not to expand eastward. In an interview with Chinese television, Putin noted that there had been ""five waves"" of expansion since the US administration assured Russia in 1991 that NATO would not expand eastward. ""And every time we expressed our concerns, they told us: well, yes, we promised that NATO would not expand to the East, but these were verbal promises, specifically, where is the piece of paper with our signature? There is no such paper, so goodbye. You see, it is very difficult to talk to these people,"" the Russian president noted. Before that, Putin made it unequivocally clear that if Ukraine were to potentially join NATO, it would pose a threat to Russia's security and would not in any way strengthen Ukraine's own security. He also stressed that one of the reasons for the Russian special military operation is ""the threat of Ukraine's entry into NATO."" In recent years, the Atlantic alliance has particularly ignored Moscow's offers related to NATO and the United States, which were aimed at providing security guarantees. These proposals included an agreement that would impose a mutual commitment by Russia and NATO to refrain from deploying troops, ships or aircraft close to each other. Furthermore, Moscow called for an immediate halt to NATO's expansion towards Russia's borders, stressing the importance of refraining from inviting post-Soviet countries into the bloc or deploying military infrastructure on their territories.",0,"['URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The West’s proxy war against Russia in Ukraine is seen as on a downward trajectory to decimate the previously fearsome reputation of NATO’s expensive and high-tech weaponry. At the same time, Russian forces have sprung a series of surprises in the conflict zone with updated and cutting-edge military technology. However, another Russian weapon has reportedly caught the attention of Western media outlets, amid concerns that it could add to Kiev’s headaches. The new UMPB D-30SN interspecific glide munition appears to be generating a lot of interest because the precision-guided winged bomb is an over-the-range weapon rumoured to be suitable for launch from aircraft and ground-based multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) such as Russia’s Tornado-S. An over-the-range weapon can be launched from a great distance, allowing its user to avoid defensive fire from the target. ""If it can also be launched from the ground, it would provide extended range and accuracy for Russian rocket artillery systems, without the need to risk tactical aircraft. This could be especially useful for hitting time-sensitive targets at long ranges, such as artillery positions and air defense systems,” wrote the US-based news portal The War Zone (TWZ). According to the publication, while details about the munition were still limited, the glide weapon, similar to a small-diameter bomb, drew parallels with the American GBU-39 small-diameter bomb, also capable of being launched from the air and the ground.

According to reports, the Canadian Armed Forces have more than 83,000 of these missiles, which were retired from service in the early 2000s and would be dismantled. A spokesman for Canadian Defence Minister Daniel Minden confirmed that the government is considering transferring the missiles. ""Before we transfer equipment to Ukraine, we work closely with Ukraine to ensure that any donations meet their military needs. We apply the same process to the CRV7 missile stockpile,"" Minden told the broadcaster. However, a defence source said that not all of these missiles have warheads. According to the TV station, only about 8,000 missiles still have warheads in good condition. Earlier, the United Kingdom proposed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to discuss sending an expeditionary force to Ukraine, as well as establishing a no-fly zone over territory controlled by the Kiev authorities. The offers come amid a series of problems between President Vladimir Zelensky's regime and the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which even this week saw rumors of an alleged dismissal of commander Valery Zaluzhny, which was subsequently denied by Kiev.

This Wednesday (28), Berlin made a point of making it clear once again that it will not send troops to Ukrainian territory and that it does not intend to expand the conflict. ""NATO is not and will not become a party to the conflict. This will continue to be the case. We do not want Russia's war with Ukraine to turn into a war between Russia and NATO.

A study carried out by NASA researchers revealed that a large part of Brazil could become uninhabitable within 50 years, due to the increase in temperatures on the planet. In addition to Brazilian lands, territories in Asia and the Middle East are also at risk of becoming inhospitable. Published in the journal Science Advances, the analysis was developed by the team of researcher Colin Raymond, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. To reach the results, the scientists observed extremes of heat and humidity across the globe, using satellite images and wet bulb temperature projections, a method that allows the measurement of humidity in the air. It is important to analyse humidity because, when it manifests itself in excess, it hinders the evaporation of sweat, which impairs the body's ability to dissipate heat and, consequently, overheats the body. Thus, the combination of high levels of humidity and extreme temperatures can be lethal. AFFECTED REGIONS

According to research by the US space agency, the Central-West, Northeast, North and Southeast regions of Brazil will be the most affected in the country. There is no exact date for when conditions in these places will become hostile, but scientists believe that the process will happen in the coming decades, driven by deforestation and the reckless consumption of natural resources. In addition to Brazil, parts of Southeast Asia will also suffer the consequences of global warming, and could record worrying combinations of temperature and humidity by 2070. In the Middle East, the regions near the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are the most threatened. Known for their already high temperatures, these places will see their temperatures rise even further in the coming decades, and could become uninhabitable within the next 46 years.",0,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An area equivalent to three cities in São Paulo can have native caatinga vegetation recovered from deforestation and desertification.

According to the study, the areas are in Cariri Oeste, in Paraíba; in Sertão do Pajeú, in Pernambuco; and in Sertão do Apodi, in Rio Grande do Norte. The research highlights that native vegetation, if restored in these 500 thousand hectares, can offer sustainable income and jobs for local populations. This, in addition to bringing water regulation, soil stabilization and erosion control. As the Project and Research Coordinator at WRI Brasil, Luciana Alves, explains:

""in the Caatinga, investments aimed at productive restoration and also at ecological restoration, is an opportunity to establish processes for conservation and restoration, but which will also bring social results, economic results and maintenance for the people who already live in this territory, in addition to to provide ecological benefits that are fundamental to climate change adaptation and mitigation processes.” The research also points out the best ways to recover these areas. Among them, the production of honey, the planting of cactus - for cattle feed -, fruit trees, the raising of goats and goats, all in the Agroforestry System. This agricultural practice combines trees and shrubs with agricultural crops and animal husbandry in the same area.

And the list goes on."" , he stated. ""To face all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease. And the disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is dependence on fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction"", he reinforced, particularly asking that G20 countries take action. While 2023 was the hottest on record, 2024 could break a new record, with temperatures well above 40ºC becoming increasingly common. In the space of a year, the 50ºC limit was exceeded in at least ten places, from Death Valley, in the United States (53.9ºC on July 7) to Agadir, in Morocco, but also in China, India, and in Brazil. However, intense heat, often less visible than other devastating impacts of climate change such as storms and floods, is more deadly. This ""silent killer"" was responsible for around 489,000 deaths per year between 2000 and 2019, compared to 16,000 deaths per year caused by cyclones, according to the ""Call to Action"" document published this Thursday by the United Nations.

Extremely high temperatures also have an economic impact. The UN estimates that losses caused by heat stress at work will reach US$2.4 trillion (R$13.5 trillion) by 2030. According to a report from the International Labor Organization published this Thursday, more than 70% of workers were exposed to extreme heat in 2020, 8.8% more than in the year 2000. ""The good news is that we can save lives and limit this impact,"" Guterres said this Thursday. The UN has called on the global community to act first to protect ""the most vulnerable"", including young children, the elderly and the poorest. In this context, early warning systems should include extreme heat, alerting populations about the arrival of heat waves and informing them about the precautions to be taken, the document added.

We know from reports that this statement was made at the meeting with Mr. Wang Yi, he stressed. The spokesman said that the details are not known at the moment, but they are important for moving forward in this direction. The last round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine on the cessation of hostilities took place on March 29, 2022 in the Turkish city of Istanbul, and since then the countries have not resumed negotiations. Moscow has repeatedly stated its willingness to resume dialogue, but has made it conditional on Ukraine revoking its decree prohibiting the resumption of peace talks. President Vladimir Putin had already formulated several conditions for opening peace talks, namely that Ukraine withdraw its troops from the four new Russian territories (Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhie) and give up joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It also demands that Ukraine maintain its neutral, non-aligned and non-nuclear status and that all sanctions against Russia be lifted. Ukraine has rejected the Russian proposal as an ultimatum. Russian forces have been conducting a special military operation since February 2022 to prevent Ukrainian shelling of civilians in Donetsk and Luhansk, two territories that gained independence from Ukraine in 2014 and joined Russia in September 2022. According to the Russian leadership, the objectives of the military campaign are to stop “the genocide of the peoples of Donetsk and Luhansk by the Ukrainian regime” and to address the national security risks posed by NATO’s eastward advance.",0,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Spain does not agree with the French proposal to send European ground troops to Ukraine, the spokesperson for the Spanish government, Pilar Alegría, said at a press conference on Tuesday (27). ""We do not agree,"" she said when asked about Madrid's position. According to her, it is necessary to speed up the delivery of weapons to Kiev, which has seen a drastic reduction in ammunition. French President Emmanuel Macron previously commented that the leaders of Western countries had discussed the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine. He admitted that there was no consensus on the matter, but that the situation could change. German Foreign Minister Olaf Scholz again ruled out the possibility, as did Poland and the Czech Republic. When asked about Macron's comments, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk said that sending soldiers would not be an option. The day before, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico also stated that sending troops from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union would only lead to an escalation of the conflict. He also said that his country would not take such a step. According to the French leader, the important thing was to ""show Russia that Western support for Ukraine will not end."" Russia has been conducting a special military operation in Ukraine since February 24, 2022, the objectives of which, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, are to protect the population from ""genocide by Kiev"" and to counter the national security risks posed by NATO's eastward advance. Moscow has repeatedly warned that NATO is ""playing with fire"" by sending weapons to Ukraine and that cargo containing any military equipment would be considered ""legitimate targets"" for the Russian army.

After a meeting between US President Joe Biden and US congressional leaders, the congressman warns that aid to Ukraine should not be at the top of the agenda of the country's lawmakers. Ukraine will be defeated by Russia if it does not get help from the US, and the allies of the Kiev regime will distance themselves from Washington. The statement was made this Tuesday (27) by the Democratic leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, after a meeting between US President Joe Biden and congressional leaders. ""The consensus in the room was that [Vladimir] Zelensky and Ukraine will lose the war if we do not provide weapons quickly,"" Schumer told reporters after the meeting. Schumer said that US aid to Ukraine cannot wait for congressional approval, since Washington cannot allow Kiev to lose the conflict. ""At best, there will be a split in NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization], and the allies will distance themselves from the United States,"" the congressman said. He added that there are four brigades of the Ukrainian Armed Forces idle on the battlefield due to a lack of weapons and ammunition. Due to the position of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, the US Congress has not yet supported the Biden administration's request to approve new funds for Kiev. The previously allocated appropriations ran out in December last year. Also after Tuesday's meeting (27), the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Republican Congressman Mike Johnson, said that providing assistance to Ukraine should not be at the top of the agenda of US lawmakers. ""My goal today was to express the obvious truth: the needs of the United States need to be met first. When you talk about that, you need to talk about an open border [on the issue of migrants]. The other priority is funding our government,"" Johnson told reporters. Russia believes that the supply of weapons to Ukraine interferes with attempts to start peace negotiations and directly involves NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov noted that any shipment containing weapons to Ukraine will become a legitimate target for Russia. According to him, the United States and NATO are directly involved in the conflict, not only by supplying weapons, but also by training fighters on the territories of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and other countries.

The United States and Europe are supplying Ukraine with obsolete weapons that need to be retired. At the same time, these nations are praising their commitment to the country's cause, according to the National Interest, a US magazine specializing in international relations. The media outlet also noted that the weapons given to Kiev are ""little better than trash"". France, for example, supplied AMX-10RC armoured vehicles, also known as light armoured tanks. However, the origins of this tank date back to the early 1980s and its last upgrade was in 2000. The French army began dismantling these tanks in 2021, after they were deemed unsuitable for modern warfare. When these tanks were deployed for the special military operation, the Russian Armed Forces were happy to help France complete the dismantling process. The Challenger-2 main battle tanks supplied to Ukraine were also at the end of their service cycle and had zero effect on the battlefield, the report said. The National Interest added that the US promise to supply more than 30 M1 Abrams main battle tanks caused euphoria in Kiev, but no one noticed the observation that the modern, upgraded version of the Abrams main battle tanks was not available. Likewise, the overpriced F-16 fighters promised to Kiev will not make any difference on the battlefield, as they are at the end of their life cycle, while Russia has fifth-generation jets that could destroy US warplanes with little effort. The situation makes columnists wonder whether the conflict in Ukraine is not just a business for Western governments, with the lives of the Ukrainian people being used as symbolic currency. “A cynical person might conclude that this was deliberate, part of a larger plan to drain Western arsenals of obsolete weapons platforms, in order to force these governments to buy more expensive and modern systems from Western defense contractors,” the magazine wrote. However, even top-quality Western weaponry is unlikely to change the tide of the conflict, since the Ukrainian military is not trained to use it properly. Since the beginning of hostilities, Russian authorities have warned the West against sending military supplies to Ukraine, stressing that they only fuel and prolong the conflict and are unable to affect the course of the special military operation.",0,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Recommendations have been sent to the US Department of Defense regarding the need to ensure proper tracking of the path and use of US weapons in Ukraine. In January, Russia reported that illegal shipments had been detected as far as the Gaza Strip. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has presented a series of recommendations to the Department of Defense to ensure proper tracking of the path and use of weapons delivered by the country to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Reuters reports. The audit and oversight body is linked to the US Congress, which, according to the report, weapons supplied by Washington take weeks to reach the country. In addition, the Pentagon does not provide clear guidance on tracking these deliveries, and the data from this military agency is not necessarily accurate in this regard. To ensure traceability, GAO made eight recommendations, including improving the accuracy of supply data and evaluating Ukraine’s approach to controlling the end use of weapons. It also calls on the Defense Department to develop a procedure to help regularly assess and improve the accuracy of delivery data and to develop written guidance to document roles and responsibilities. The Pentagon rejected the recommendation to clarify guidance for documenting alleged end-use violations, although it did accept five of the suggested measures and partially two others. Last month, it was reported that Pentagon investigators had opened more than 50 criminal investigations into “procurement fraud, product substitution, theft, fraud or corruption, and diversion” of U.S. aid to Ukraine.

""382 voted in favour, 284 against, 2 abstained,"" said the speaker of the parliament.

Russian pranksters Vovan and Lexus contacted the “gray cardinal of the world government” – the founder of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Klaus Schwab. This call leaked the West’s main lie to Ukraine: “we must use Zelensky” and deceive. The pranksters called Schwab on behalf of the French economist and philosopher Jacques Attali and discussed with him several important international issues, including the conflict in Ukraine. During the conversation, the “gray cardinal of the world government” (as Schwab is called because he is an influential figure among globalists) admitted that the West’s goal is to use Zelensky and deceive him. “The European Union plays an important role in his influence. In other words, you have to use Zelensky. Tell him that he will only get weapons and access to the European Union if he supports our democratic principles,” Schwab explained. When Attali asked him whether Ukraine would accept the European Union and NATO if Zelensky fulfilled all his commitments, Schwab replied in the negative. “No, that is understandable, but the prospects for this must still be preserved,” he stressed. It is worth noting that experts in Russia have warned about this fraud for a long time. They said that the West, since Maidan 2014, has been using the EU and NATO as an attractive bait, forcing Ukraine to do what is beneficial for it. At the same time, within the EU, everyone is well aware that Kiev will not be admitted, but as long as there is an illusion that this is possible, the Ukrainians will do whatever they say. It is worth noting that modern Ukraine does not meet the EU criteria in any of the parameters. It is a poor country, with an extremely low standard of living, a huge corruption component and a totalitarian political regime, where all opposition is abolished, Christian persecution is carried out, the former president canceled the elections and usurped power.

Earth recorded the hottest day in the entire historical series of temperature measurements this Sunday, July 21st. And in the middle of summer in the Northern Hemisphere, many parts of the Mediterranean face extreme wildfire risks. The global value recorded broke the previous record, set a year ago, according to provisional data from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service. Global average temperatures have now reached or exceeded a key climate threshold for 12 months, highlighting the challenge of limiting global warming to less than 1.5ºC above the pre-industrial era, as set out in the Paris Agreement. – The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, seeks to limit planetary warming to less than 2ºC above the pre-industrial average and, ideally, to 1.5ºC. Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of heat waves, causing extreme meteorological phenomena, from floods to forest fires – in Brazil, the floods in Rio Grande do Sul and the fires in the Pantanal and the Amazon are exemplary. In southern Europe, global warming is causing temperatures above 40ºC, as occurred in the last two weeks in Greece. Therefore, the threats to forest fires are increasing. In Greece, at least 33 wildfires broke out between Sunday and Monday 22nd. Athens and parts of the south of the country remain on high alert. Cooler weather will bring some relief to the Mediterranean nation this week, although temperatures are still expected to top 39C in parts of the European continent on Tuesday 23rd. Spain is also at extreme risk of fires this week as temperatures rise in the south of the country. Seville and Cordoba are expected to approach 43C on Wednesday 24th, according to the Spanish meteorological agency AEMET. Parts of southern France and Italy are also at risk of wildfires. Further north, Berlin and Paris – which will host the Olympic Games starting this week – are expected to face heatwaves in early August. The average temperature in the German capital is expected to rise to 28C on 6th August, eight degrees above the 30-year normal. Extreme heat has already wreaked havoc on many parts of the global economy this year, affecting everything from air travel to power grids.

Poland today commented on opposition within the European Union (EU) to the use of dividends from frozen assets of the Central Bank of Russia (BCR) in Western financial institutions to purchase weapons from Ukraine, the capital's press said. Two EU countries are missing to reach a consensus on the use of profits resulting from the BCR's retention in banks of around 300 billion dollars, said the head of Polish diplomacy, Rodoslav Sikorsky, quoted by radio station RMF24. That country's chancellor revealed that he raised the issue of frozen funds with his French counterpart, Stéphane Séjourné, during a recent meeting of EU foreign ministers. Canada, the United States, Japan and the EU retain BCR assets, including almost six billion dollars on US soil, while 210 billion are deposited in the Euroclear bank in Belgium. Several European nations at the time proposed using dividends from frozen Russian money to finance Ukraine's rearmament, something rejected by Moscow, which threatens painful response measures. Russia also warns that such action would create a disastrous precedent for the international financial system, since many countries, especially developing ones, keep their assets in Western banks, given their high reliability, which would now be called into question. Despite this, the main leaders of the group of seven most industrialized countries (France, the United States, Japan, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany) agreed to allocate 50 billion dollars to the purchase of weapons from Ukraine, using withheld funds.",0,"['URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The magnificent reception of the President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, in Paris, given by the French President, Emmanuel Macron, during the Serb's official visit to France, was overshadowed by the disagreement between the two leaders on the issue of Kosovo, expressed in the press conference joint. Although both agreed that the European Union (EU) is a zone of common interest, the Serbian president did not like the way Macron spoke about Kosovo and Metohija, that is, that both sides, Belgrade and Pristina, make equal efforts. The Serbian president did not agree, stressing that Kosovo did not comply with everything, from the Brussels and Ohrid agreements, citing the elections in the North, the expropriation of Serb lands, the presence of the Kosovo police, and even the shooting of Serbian children. Serbia's position clearly stated

Diplomat and former ambassador Branko Brankovic told Sputnik that the Serbian president acted correctly and moderately, but with a clear attitude that he does not agree with Macron when it comes to Kosovo and Metohija. ""Vucic was certainly very detailed in his private conversation with Macron, but it is important that he made it clear at the press conference that Serbia maintains the position that Kosovo is not a state and what EU states do is the greatest hypocrisy. "", highlights the diplomat. According to the former ambassador, by placing Serbia as a sovereign state and Kosovo as a protectorate on the same level, Macron demonstrated that his view on the issue will not change. On the other hand, Brankovic notes, they are aware that the EU cannot be complete without Serbia, but Serbia on its terms. So there is a lot of talk about this, because they would have a lot of problems if Serbia turned its back on the EU. ""It turns out that, in fact, France does not move away from the positions of Europe and, above all, from the positions of the West, that is, the famous trio of the USA, the United Kingdom and Germany in relation to the position of Serbia at this moment. Therefore , for Serbia's international position and for everything else linked to future cooperation related to Serbia's accession to the EU,"" Brankovic added. In other words, for the diplomat, the situation showed that Macron remained in a position already known: independent Kosovo, and let's forget about cooperation with Russia. Despair of the West

""In this whole issue, I see desperation on the part of the West, because they have to put pressure on us, since they have wasted all the trump cards they had in relation to Ukraine, and the very existence of the NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] pact has become very shaken"", said the diplomat. According to Brankovic, ""this means that the European Union must think seriously about what to do, because what they invested in Ukraine was in vain because Russia is winning there, regardless of Macron's words that Russia should not win."" Meanwhile, as he continued, ""not knowing how to get out of Ukraine and save face, Macron and the others are trying to use what is related to Kosovo to force us to take some action, which would give them justification for bombing Yugoslavia for NATO and, now, for Ukraine"", concluded the diplomat.",0,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

While Kiev publicly rejects accusations of being “hospitable” to international terrorism, even Ukrainian journalists admit that the country’s authorities are “strangely” turning a blind eye to the issue. Senior Daesh member Caesar Tokhosashvili, also known as al-Bara al-Shishani, lived “quietly” with his wife and three children in the Ukrainian town of Belaya Tserkov for more than a year before being tracked down and detained by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 2019, reports have revealed. The news undermines Ukraine’s official stance on opposing terrorism and indicates that the country remains a safe haven for such operatives. The CIA operation to capture Tokhosashvili — who is of Georgian origin — was conducted in collaboration with the Georgian Interior Ministry and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). Even Western media at the time asked: “Why did they choose not to arrest him earlier?” What is known about the notorious Daesh terrorist? His arrest five years ago made global headlines, with The Independent quoting Philip Ingram, a former British intelligence officer, admitting that Kiev's ""lax"" government had created ""an obvious vulnerability to international terrorism"", something it said he, ""Kiev doesn't seem entirely interested in addressing."" The former officer was echoed by Vera Mironova, a jihad expert and visiting fellow at Harvard University, who told The Independent that ""hundreds"" of former Daesh militants had ""fled to Ukraine"". ""When these terrorists arrive in Ukraine, they rarely encounter problems with the authorities,"" according to Mironova. A similar tone was struck by Kiev-based journalist Katerina Sergatskova, who highlighted that Ukrainian authorities remain ""strangely relaxed on the issue"". ""Whenever I've written about the issue, government officials have accused me of inventing the problem. But the arrest of one of Daesh's top commanders here in Kiev, right under our noses, would certainly suggest that many of the world's most dangerous men think about Ukraine as a safe home.

The takeover of the Ukrainian parliament by the country's military would not be a popular move, expert Aleksandr Dudchak told Sputnik, suggesting that a potential rebellion was orchestrated from the West. The disillusioned Ukrainian military is planning to take control of the Supreme Rada (Ukrainian parliament), according to an exchange of messages from a private Telegram channel called ParaBelum, obtained by Sputnik. ""This could be a scenario of replacing Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky without holding elections,"" Aleksandr Dudchak, a researcher at the Institute of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and an expert on the ""Other Ukraine"" movement, told Sputnik. Members of the confidential channel, consisting of commanders and soldiers of elite units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, were discussing options for overthrowing the current government and its military command following the resignation of then-commander-in-chief General Valery Zaluzhny. ""The most important action that we will need to take quickly is the seizure of the Supreme Rada at a certain point,"" one of the chat participants wrote. Members also expressed dissatisfaction with the decisions of Zelensky and the new commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Aleksandr Syrsky, who was appointed a month ago to replace Zaluzhny. The alleged coup plotters have placed particular emphasis on the involvement of Ukrainian troops fighting on the front lines in the anti-Zelensky movement. According to investigator Dudchak, the involvement of Ukrainian personnel on active duty is fraught with risks, since those in the trenches are closely monitored by foreign mercenaries from “containment detachments” with orders to shoot anyone who abandons their positions. If Ukrainian troops are allowed to march towards Kiev, it would mean that the regime change scenario was written in Washington in response to Zelensky’s refusal to hold elections this year, Dudchak argued. The leaders of Ukraine’s elite units, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the nationalist Azov and Aidar battalions (Nazi terrorist organizations banned in Russia) are also reportedly planning to create a radical party with a military wing. The expert insists that none of the Ukrainian military and intelligence structures are independent, arguing that each of them has British or American ""overseers."" ""The confrontation between the military and the Kiev regime is, in general, a manifestation of the confrontation between London and Washington,"" Dudchak said. ""The president's office is under British control, while the military, which is supposed to meet on Zaluzhny's behalf, is under American control, and the SBU is also a US-backed structure.""

According to the FSB note accompanied by a video and published this Friday on its Telegram channel, the individual confessed to having had links with Ukrainian security since February 2023. Earlier, the FSB reported that Evgeny Serebriakov, involved in the explosion of a car in the north of Moscow on July 24, was deported this Friday to Turkey, where he fled after committing the crime. Born in 1995, Serebriakov was captured on Thursday in the Turkish city of Bodrum thanks to the interaction of Turkish security forces and Russia, which issued an international search and arrest warrant against him. During his initial interrogation, the man said that he had contacted the administrator of a social media channel “to collaborate with the Ukrainian special services” on his own initiative and that he had subsequently established contact with a certain Ilya, an alleged agent of that country’s security service. The two communicated via the instant messaging application Wire, which allows encrypted messages to be sent, and on one occasion they met in Istanbul. In the video released by the FSB, Serebriakov revealed that his alleged Ukrainian contact “proposed to eliminate an officer”, for whom he had collected components of an explosive device west of Moscow. “Under Iliá’s guidance and control, I made an explosive device and installed it under a car,” he confessed. On Wednesday, at around 6 am (Moscow time), the explosion of a bomb attached to a car injured two people, a man and a woman, in a residential neighborhood in northern Moscow.

A Ukrainian defense source said that several drones attacked the Tuapse refinery, a city on the Black Sea coast in Russia's southwestern Krasnodar region, causing a fire. ""The extent of the damage is being clarified,"" the Ukrainian source said, specifying that it is a refinery owned by Russian giant Rosneft, equipped with a port terminal and that almost 90% of its production is destined for export. On the social network Telegram, Russian regional authorities said, in turn, that the fire at the refinery was caused by ""drone debris falling."" ""The Kyiv regime has once again attempted to attack civilian infrastructure in Tuapse with drones,"" the Russian sources said. About a hundred rescue teams were mobilized to the site and brought the flames under control early this morning, and according to preliminary information, there were no casualties. Meanwhile, a tractor driver was killed by a drone on Sunday and his wife was injured while they were working in a field near the village of Ustinka in Russia's western Belgorod region, according to local governor Vyacheslav Gladkov, who identified the drone as Ukrainian. The Russian military announced today that it had shot down 80 Ukrainian drones since Sunday night, including 47 in the southern Rostov region alone, on the border with Ukraine. According to this source, one drone was destroyed in Belgorod, another in Voronezh, another in Smolensk, eight in Krasnodar and 17 in the Black and Azov Seas. In a separate statement, the Russian army added that it destroyed five drones at around 7am (5am in Lisbon) over the Astrakan region.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is systematically strengthening its military potential along Russia's borders, from the Barents Sea to the Black Sea, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said in an interview with the Russian newspaper Argumenty i Fakty. ""Even the term 'eastern side of NATO' has appeared in speeches of the bloc's leaders and documents, including for all Eastern European countries bordering Russia and its allies. Belarus, as well as Romania and, more recently, Sweden and Finland,"" Patrushev said during the conversation on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the creation of the war bloc. ""The alliance's leaders do not hide the fact that the largest military maneuvers near Russia's borders since the collapse of the Soviet Union, 'Steadfast Defender 2024', which are being held in Europe, are aimed precisely at 'containing Russia'. Last year alone, NATO and its member states conducted 130 coalition and more than a thousand national military exercises. In addition, the secretary added that the plans of the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) include preserving Ukraine, or at least part of it, ""as an anti-Russian territory entirely under their control, completely dedicated to serving the interests of the bloc."" Patrushev also said that there is irrefutable evidence that Kiev, at the instigation of the US and NATO, after the February 2014 coup in Ukraine, intended to resolve the issue with the ""stubborn"" regions with extreme force and severity.

""NATO instructors are training mercenaries and saboteurs in several countries to participate in anti-Russian operations,"" Patrushev said. According to the secretary, the war bloc is actively involved in organising bombings of Russian territories and making decisions on new deliveries of weapons with greater long-range capabilities to Kiev. ""In fact, the Atlantic Alliance is a party to the Ukrainian conflict,"" he said. According to Patrushev, the recent statement by the head of the NATO Military Committee, Rob Bauer, about the bloc's preparation for an open conflict with Moscow is in line with all its policies. ""In March, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg presented an annual report on the organization's activities over the past year. The entire document focuses on the main task of 'containing' Russia and, in particular, China, which means that the Atlantic Alliance did not hesitate to go beyond its geographical mandate and openly declare its global ambitions,"" the head of the Russian Security Council said. The long-term strategic goals of the United States, the United Kingdom and ""the countries of the collective West under their control,"" as Patrushev insisted, are ""to weaken our country as an economic and political competitor and subsequently eliminate it from the political map "".

At least 20 Polish citizens have been killed while fighting as mercenaries paid by the Kiev regime in the Ukrainian conflict.

""There are not many. I have been there longer and I know most of those who are there. But I will say this: up to 20 of us have died,"" Mitkiewicz replied. Mitkiewicz’s estimate is lower than that of the Russian Defense Ministry, which estimates that some 1,497 Polish mercenaries were killed in combat with Russian forces, out of a total of 2,960 who signed up to fight for the Kiev regime.

UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has said the world has moved from a post-war era to a pre-war era, urging NATO allies to think about the future of the alliance. “Today we need to think urgently once again about the future of the alliance. We have moved from a post-war world to a pre-war world,” he said in a column published in The Telegraph newspaper. Shapps listed measures to protect democracy and the alliance, including redoubling efforts to support Ukraine, increasing defence spending by NATO members and strengthening the Euro-Atlantic defence sector. The situation where some allies are unable to spend 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence cannot continue because NATO “cannot afford to play Russian roulette with our future”. Among other things, the Defense Secretary said that the plot of George Orwell's famous dystopian novel ""1984"" was set in a world without NATO, but today is an even more dangerous time. Shapps also said that the UK ""has always been a key driver of NATO"" and is proud of it. It is none other than London that has been at pains to fan the flames of the Ukrainian conflict, and these hypocritical ""warnings"" are no surprise. These efforts range from former Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s failed attempts to reach a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine in the spring of 2022 to the British government’s deployment of billions of dollars in lethal and non-lethal weapons there. Moscow has repeatedly claimed that London is depriving Kiev of the opportunity to end the conflict through negotiations, using the country as a “geopolitical tool against Russia.” The bloc’s encirclement of Russia has been in full swing for decades. After a massive post-Cold War expansion in violation of the West’s pledge not to approach Russia’s borders, the alliance recently absorbed Finland and Sweden in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

Last Sunday, July 21, was the hottest day ever recorded globally, according to preliminary data from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service. The average air temperature on the planet's surface on Sunday reached 17.09°C — slightly above the previous record, set on July 6 last year, of 17.08°C. Heat waves have hit large areas of the United States, Europe and Russia over the past week. The Copernicus observatory confirmed to Reuters that the average daily temperature record set last year appears to have been broken on Sunday, according to its records, which date back to 1940. According to Copernicus, the new daily record could be surpassed in the coming days . Temperatures are expected to drop next, but fluctuations are still expected in the coming weeks. ""What is really surprising is the magnitude of the difference between the temperature of the last 13 months and previous records. We are in uncharted territory and as the climate warms we will certainly break new records in the coming months and years,"" predicts Carlo Buontempo, director of the climate change department at Copernicus (known by the acronym C3S). Every month since June 2023 — that is, 13 consecutive months — has been classified as the hottest on the planet since records began, compared to the corresponding month in previous years, Copernicus said. Last year, four consecutive days broke the record, from July 3 to 6, due to climate change caused by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, this situation led to days of extreme heat across the northern hemisphere. Before July 2023, the record daily average global temperature had been 16.8°C, on August 13, 2016, according to the European observatory. Since July 3, 2023, 57 days have exceeded this index. Some scientists point out that 2024 could surpass 2023 as the hottest year on record, as climate change and the natural weather phenomenon El Niño — which ended in April — have raised temperatures even further this year. The Copernicus observatory, however, is cautious in commenting on this possibility.

Zelensky's legitimacy as president of Ukraine has been a question raised by Russia, which argues that the Ukrainian leader's term ended on May 20.

""For now, as you can see, we have heard very different statements, so far things are not very clear,"" he added. On Wednesday, Peskov recalled that Russian President Vladimir Putin had stated that “Zelensky lost his legitimacy” after the end of his term, which “is a factor that could significantly hinder the peace process.” The spokesman also stressed that Russia will ensure the defence of its interests and security in any case, whether through negotiations or weapons. “The special military operation was launched as a last resort to achieve our goals,” Peskov said, stressing that “any war ends with peace negotiations.” In recent days, Zelensky has stressed the need for negotiations to end the war as soon as possible.

The Republican convention here in Milwaukee brings together party officials and delegates from all states and American territories. Few are from the poorest sectors of the population. They are mostly white men in suits with Trumpist caps. There was little diversity in the audience. The atmosphere was festive. I did not witness hostility. Many of the agendas are legitimate. But the radicalism at other times of people with that friendly “Nice to meet you” smile is scary. In his speech, Donald Trump once again used a slogan already famous in the current campaign. “Drill baby, drill!” (Drill, baby, drill), they screamed. This phrase in English indicates that oil prospecting should be one of the Republican's priorities if he wins the elections, ignoring warnings about the risks of using this polluting energy at a time of worsening climate change. Immigration is another point that draws attention when Trump uses terms like “invasion” to describe the migratory movement to the US from the border with Mexico. The immigrants, which include many families with children, are classified as criminals by the former president. Their voters cheer, shout “build the wall” and display signs saying “mass deportation”. Guns are also a hot topic among Trump supporters. At the convention, there were a number of T-shirts with slogans about the right to own and carry guns. This is ironic, since guns are banned at the convention, except in the hands of the police and the Secret Service. More seriously, Trump was almost killed by a 20-year-old who had access to an AR15 rifle and still didn’t change his mind.

Russia considers the US position on the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack to be clearly biased, Washington is trying to defend Ukraine, Maria Zakharova, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told Sputnik. Earlier, the head of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) Aleksandr Bortnikov said that preliminary data on those arrested in the case of the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack confirmed the Ukrainian trail, and that the security services will continue to work on the information. ""They exposed themselves. They [the US] started shouting, not calling for an investigation, and started shielding Ukraine from the blow. Their involvement and involvement in this story is obvious,"" Zakharova said. According to the diplomat, in the absence of Kiev's involvement, Washington's first statements should have been about the need for an investigation and presentation of facts. It is worth noting that shortly after Friday's (22) attack, the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, John Kirby, said there was no evidence that Ukraine or Ukrainians were involved in the Moscow attack. The US later repeatedly stated that there was no ""Ukrainian trail"" in the case. In particular, the US State Department stated that ""there was no Ukrainian involvement in the attack on Crocus City Hall, period."" In response, Maria Zakharova expressed doubts that the Washington authorities would draw ""conclusions about anyone's involvement in the tragedy."" The attack on Crocus City Hall, located in the city of Krasnogorsk, outside Moscow, occurred on Friday night (22), when a large number of people were preparing to attend a concert by the Russian rock band Picnic.

540,PT_28.txt,"West would condone ‘virtually any crime’ Ukraine committed, military analyst argues

One example is the silence on Ukraine’s illegal use of anti-personnel mines, which were banned by the 1999 Mine Ban Treaty. The military equipment that became common during World War II was designed to kill or injure several people who were near the devices after they exploded. The West would likely condone any crime committed by the Kiev regime against Russia, argued Boris Rozhin, a military expert at the Center for Military-Political Journalism. In one example, Rozhin pointed to the illegal use of anti-personnel mines by President Vladimir Zelensky’s government. The 1999 Ottawa Treaty, or simply the Mine Ban Treaty, was ratified by Ukraine at the time and prohibits signatory countries from using anti-personnel landmines. Since the beginning of the Russian special military operation, Ukraine has been using the equipment in its combat operations, including targeting civilians in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). However, there has been no reaction from Western politicians. ""So any crime that Ukraine could commit, all of them would be approved,"" Rozhin said, adding that outrageous acts that the West could not openly approve of would be ""contained at the media level."" ""There is no reason to believe that the West would in any way condemn or protest against such use [of landmines] by Ukraine. On the contrary, the West supplies [Kiev] with the same type of anti-personnel mines that are being used against civilians, and this is approved by the Western leadership,"" he condemned. Regarding the fact that Washington turns a blind eye to the use of weapons prohibited by international treaties by its allies, such as the use of white phosphorus munitions by Israel, Rozhin explained that ""essentially, none of the international treaties work today."" According to the analyst, Western powers choose to abide by the treaties that they consider advantageous at the moment, while those considered disadvantageous to their interests are used to accuse Russia of one or another offense. The conventions in question are not subject to independent monitoring, while international organizations are used by the West for propaganda. ""That said, when it comes to the use of certain banned munitions, such as cluster munitions, accusing Ukraine of this is laughable,"" Rozhin said. According to the expert, ""the United States, in particular, has supplied Ukraine with a vast quantity of cluster munitions that are being used by Kiev both in combat and against civilians, so there is no reason to expect any reaction.""",0,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia will consider any US troops sent to Ukraine as interventionists. The remarks were made during an interview with Dmitry Kiselev, CEO of the Rossiya Segodnya media group, which Sputnik is part of. Putin responded to the announcement that the US would not send troops to Ukraine by saying that Russia would not underestimate the seriousness of such an action. ""We know what US troops are on Russian territory, they are intervention troops, and that is how we will treat them, even if they appear on Ukrainian territory,"" the Russian president said. Putin stressed that Washington understands Russia's position on the issue. Tensions between Russia and the West have been rising since 2014, and the US and its NATO allies have supported Kiev. Putin, in the interview, also did not rule out the possibility of Russia conducting nuclear tests if the US does so. ""If they carry out such tests, I do not exclude it, it is not mandatory, if we need it, we do not need it, we still have to think about it, but I do not exclude that we can do the same."" He specified that Russian forces are prepared for a nuclear war: ""From a military point of view, of course we are ready. Our forces are constantly on alert."" ""I said that [US President Joe] Biden is a representative of the traditional political school, and this is being confirmed. There, besides Biden, are many other experts in Russian-American relations and deterrence strategy. Therefore, I do not believe that everything is heading directly towards this, but we are ready."" He stressed that there is a treaty that prohibits such tests. The Americans have not ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), and Russia has withdrawn its ratification in order to maintain parity, the Russian president recalled. ""Since the treaty was not ratified by the United States, it did not enter into legal force, because it did not receive the required number of ratifications. However, we are still observing these agreements,"" Putin said. However, he added that the possibility of conducting such tests is being considered in the US. ""This is due to the fact that when new warheads appear, some experts believe that it is not enough to test them only on the computer, they need to be tested in real conditions."" ""Such ideas are circulating in certain groups in the US. We know about this. And we are also observing,"" the Russian president said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday congratulated Nicolás Maduro on his victory in Venezuela’s election, and the Kremlin said it was deepening cooperation in all areas — including sensitive ones — with Caracas. Maduro and his opposition rival Edmundo Gonzalez both claimed victory in the presidential election, with Washington and some other foreign governments casting doubt on the official results that gave the incumbent victory. The national election authority said Maduro had won a third term with 51% of the vote. Putin backed Maduro, 61, an ally who accuses the United States and the West of fueling the war in Ukraine, saying Moscow enjoyed a strategic partnership with the South American country and that Maduro was always welcome in Russia. “Russian-Venezuelan relations have the character of a strategic partnership,” Putin said in a message to Maduro, according to the Kremlin. ""I am confident that your activities as head of state will continue to contribute to its progressive development in all directions. This fully serves the interests of our friendly peoples and is in line with the construction of a more just and democratic world order,"" Putin said. “I would like to confirm our willingness to continue our constructive joint work on current issues on the bilateral and international agenda.” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had serious concerns that the results announced by the electoral authority did not reflect the votes of the people. The authority is supposed to be an independent body, but the opposition says it acts as an arm of the Maduro government. But Moscow sees Venezuela as an important partner in Latin America, and the two sanctioned states have cooperated over the past two decades in areas such as oil, weapons and military exercises. When asked whether Russia would deepen cooperation with Venezuela, including in the area of ​​defense, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “We are developing our relations with Venezuela in all areas, including sensitive ones.” “This cooperation is in the interests of both the Venezuelan people and the Russians, so we will develop our relations with Venezuela comprehensively,” Peskov added.",0,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Russia has international support from a number of countries and people', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In recent weeks, attacks on this Russian region, which borders the Ukrainian provinces of Sumy, Kharkiv and Lugansk from west to south, the latter of which was annexed by Russia in September 2022, have intensified. The Russian military offensive on Ukrainian territory, launched on 24 February 2022, has plunged Europe into what is considered the most serious security crisis since the Second World War (1939-1945). Ukraine has been relying on financial and weapons aid from its Western allies, who have also imposed sanctions on key sectors of the Russian economy in an attempt to reduce Moscow's ability to finance the war effort. Recent months have been marked by large-scale Russian airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, while Kiev's forces have targeted targets in Russian territory near the border and on the Crimean peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014.

One month after the start of summer in the northern hemisphere, last Sunday, July 21, the world recorded the hottest day in history, according to preliminary data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, linked to the European Union. The global average air temperature this Sunday reached 17.09 ºC – slightly above the previous record, set in July last year, of 17.08 ºC. It may not seem like a big deal, but the rise in temperatures is part of a dangerous trend over the last 13 months, in which each of them, consecutively, broke their respective records compared to the same month in previous years. In the boreal summer, heat waves have already started to hit large areas of the United States, Western Europe – mainly in the Mediterranean region – and Russia last week. In addition to causing fires in California and causing Greece to close public monuments, the heat also raised the temperature of the oceans and caused the earliest and most intense hurricane season in the Atlantic.

The Copernicus institute confirmed to the Reuters news agency that the average daily temperature record set last year was broken on Sunday, according to its records, which date back to 1940. Last year, four consecutive days broke this record, by July 3rd to 6th. It is the direct result of the effects of climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, which have caused increasingly extreme heat waves and progressively higher temperatures across the planet.

""Floods pose the greatest mortality risk, with an estimated 8.5 million deaths by 2050, followed by droughts (3.2 million) and heat waves (1.6 million),"" said a press release from the report, which estimates that ""the total costs of health systems to treat diseases caused by climate change will exceed the value of one billion euros"" in the same year.

Asia is the region where the impact of climate change in terms of health is expected to be greatest, with “economic losses of around 3.2 trillion euros” being calculated. In terms of economic losses, Europe (2.3 trillion), South America (1.9 trillion) and Africa (1.8 trillion euros) follow.

""The concentrated presence of NATO ships - and we take into account Bulgaria and Romania, which are NATO littoral states - poses additional threats to Russia, especially in the current situation,"" he said.

The Kremlin signaled on Thursday that it is open to negotiations with Ukraine to end the conflict while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy remains in power, despite publicly questioning his legitimacy to rule. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Wednesday during a visit to China that Kiev was prepared to hold talks with Russia as long as Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity were fully respected, though he said Ukraine saw no sign of that. The Kremlin, while signaling its readiness for talks on its own terms, has publicly questioned Zelenskiy’s mandate to rule, noting that his five-year term expired in May and that he should have called an election. Zelenskiy and the West argue that normal political rules must be suspended in wartime and that the Kremlin, given Russia’s tightly controlled political system, is in no position to criticize. When asked on Thursday whether Russia would be ready to hold talks with Ukraine while Zelenskiy was in power, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters:

“Russia is generally open to a negotiation process. But first we need to understand how ready the Ukrainian side is for this and how much the Ukrainian side is allowed to do this by its handlers.” Moscow describes Zelenskyy as a puppet of the United States, a characterization it rejects. “Because so far we see very different statements being made, and this is still not very clear. Moreover, in addition to the problem with Zelenskyy’s legitimacy, there is also a problem with the (Ukrainian) legal ban on having any contacts and negotiations with the Russian side. So there is still a lot to be clarified and clarifications to be heard,” Peskov said. Pressed during a conference call whether the Kremlin would consider the possibility of negotiating with Zelenskyy or whether it categorically ruled out such a possibility, Peskov said:

“The question is not easy. From a legal point of view, this problem (of his legitimacy) is on the agenda, but from a practical point of view, we are open to achieving our goals through negotiations. So different options are possible here.""

The pinnacle of useful idiocy. Historically, young people have always been pawns of certain ideological elites. Social movements are almost always inorganic, almost always artificial, created in universities and then amplified by the “owners” of the narratives and by those who hold the dominant instruments in the communication system, in this case the media. It is no coincidence that social networks are completely attacked in every way, precisely because of this. What social networks came to do was to take away the monopoly of narratives from the owners of the communication system. What is the main objective of these social movements? The main or only objective, regardless of whether the activists are aware of it or not, some will be aware, others have no idea at all – they believe they are defending very important causes. But the main objective is the destruction of the infrastructure of Western society, or in Marxist terms, of “bourgeois capitalist” society. They use numerous tools: the LGBT movement, instrumentalized to destroy the traditional family, which is the basis of any healthy and civilized society and is the basis of Western civilization. The “climate madness”, which aims to take away people’s freedoms. The end of fossil fuels, which is linked to climate change, ultimately aims to destroy the energy base of the bourgeois capitalist model. Regarding this action at the Faculty of Psychology – anti-Zionism. Zionism is a nationalist political movement. That is the problem. Communism is one of the globalist currents and is intrinsically internationalist. The Nation is to be destroyed and, therefore, the Zionist State of Israel is a problem (Jewish anti-nationalism). All these instruments contribute to the destruction of the pillars that support the edifice of Western civilization and the objective is to destroy them, so that the way is clear for the end of the market economy.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has condemned what it said was an attempt by the West to cover up its role and demonise the Russian government following the tragedy at the concert hall. Western media outlets have been instructed to keep quiet about the number of victims of the terrorist attack at Crocus City Hall, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday (8). ""Particularly cynical are the attempts by the West to distract the international community from the real organisers and beneficiaries by categorically instructing them not to cover the true scale of the tragedy in the media: not to mention the number of victims of the terrorist attack, the number of children killed, or to show the reaction of ordinary citizens to what happened,"" the ministry said on its Telegram channel. The foreign ministry explained this by a desire not to show sympathy and humanism towards the Russians. The ministry added that immediately after the attack, Western media and authorities organized a public relations campaign to deny the involvement of Ukrainian security services. The media were instructed to spread the story that Daesh (a terrorist organization banned in Russia and several other countries) was involved in organizing the attack; they were instructed to deny the Islamists’ links to Kiev and Western secret services, as well as to discredit the results of the investigation and promote the theory that “Russian secret services were involved”. On March 22, several armed men stormed the Crocus City Hall concert hall and started shooting at people. The terrorists also set fire to the venue. The attack left 144 people dead, according to the latest figures from the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The four main suspects in the case — all citizens of Tajikistan — tried to flee the scene by car, but were detained near the Russian border and charged with terrorism. Russian authorities believe that the suspects planned to flee to Ukraine, where the organizers of the attack had a safe haven for them.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Saturday (2) that sending military personnel from the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to Ukraine could precipitate a global apocalypse. In a video posted on social media, he highlighted Ukraine's inability to resolve the conflict, despite the substantial financial and military aid provided by the West. He stressed that, although the military presence of the EU and NATO could potentially change the dynamics of the conflict, it could also trigger catastrophic consequences. ""The West sees that, despite significant financial and military aid, Ukraine is incapable of resolving this armed conflict"". ""The situation could change with the arrival of EU and NATO military personnel in Ukraine, but then there would be nothing left but to wait for the arrival of the global apocalypse"", said the Slovak Prime Minister. Fico stressed the pressing need for modern air defense systems for Ukraine, but warned that the West cannot provide these systems without a commitment to maintain and operate them. He also argued that sending Western troops would only exacerbate the conflict, rather than resolve it. Russia has been continuing its special military operation in Ukraine since February 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin justified the move as a measure to protect the population from “genocide” by the Kiev regime and to counter NATO’s eastward advance. Moscow has repeatedly warned against Western arms supplies to Kiev, saying that foreign convoys carrying weapons would be legitimate targets for its forces once they crossed the border.

The meetings served as a sort of screening of what was acceptable to both countries – but Ukraine never had representatives at these meetings. The governments of Russia and the US authorized these meetings, even though they were not official. The negotiations lasted just over a year, but according to the Russian minister, they did not produce the desired result. In practice, they were of no use. Sergei Lavrov only shared one more topic addressed in these meetings: the status of ethnic Russians within Ukraine.

Citing sources close to the Kremlin, the Bloomberg news agency had reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to understand whether Washington was in favour of starting talks on ending the war in Ukraine. Russia denied this Friday that President Vladimir Putin had expressed any willingness to the United States to negotiate Ukraine's entry into NATO in exchange for Russian control over the territories annexed in the neighbouring country. ""This information is wrong and does not coincide at all with reality,"" said the spokesman for the Russian Presidency (Kremlin), Dmitry Peskov, at the usual daily press conference. Previously, and citing sources close to the Kremlin, the Bloomberg news agency had reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to understand whether Washington was in favour of starting talks on ending the war in Ukraine. According to two sources cited by Bloomberg, the Russian leader had sent signals to the United States of America (USA) about a possible willingness by Moscow to engage in dialogue. According to information provided by the news agency, the Kremlin leader may be willing to consider Ukraine's eventual accession to the Atlantic Alliance, provided that Kiev accepts the new ""territorial realities"", referring to the Ukrainian regions annexed by Moscow. Until now, Ukraine has always opposed making territorial concessions to Moscow or freezing the conflict because, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, this would only benefit Moscow.

The Kremlin also criticized Western countries for failing to condemn the downing of the Russian Il-76 military transport plane, which was carrying Ukrainian prisoners and which Moscow says was Ukraine's responsibility, during Thursday's meeting of the United Nations Security Council. ""So far, there is no categorical condemnation from Western countries of this horrific terrorist attack. We have not heard a single word of condemnation,"" Peskov said. According to the Kremlin spokesman, ""this event requires a proper assessment by the international community,"" since, he claimed, ""this is not the first time that Kiev has killed its own people."" Asked about the Russian presidency's willingness to present evidence to the UN or other international organizations that Ukraine was involved in the downing of the plane or that Ukrainian authorities knew who was traveling on board the aircraft, Peskov replied only that, at this moment, he had ""nothing to add"". ""Investigators are working and decisions will be made as they obtain all the necessary information,"" he added. According to the Russian version, the Il-76 military transport plane was shot down on Wednesday by Ukraine with 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war on board, as well as six crew members and three Russian guards, which was allegedly traveling to Ukraine for a prisoner exchange. In turn, Ukraine, which confirmed that an exchange was being prepared, claims that the plane was carrying weapons and not prisoners of war.

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Ukraine joining NATO would be a declaration of war against Moscow and that only “prudence” on behalf of the alliance could prevent the planet from being torn apart.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders pledged at their summit last week to support Ukraine on an “irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,” but left open the question of when that membership might happen.

Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council and a leading voice among Kremlin hawks, told the Argumenty I Fakty media outlet that Ukraine’s accession would go beyond a direct threat to Moscow’s security.

“This would essentially be a declaration of war – albeit a belated one,” he said in comments published on Wednesday.

“The actions that Russia’s opponents have been taking against us for years, expanding the alliance, are bringing NATO to a point of no return.”

In a standard Kremlin line since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Medvedev said Russia was not threatening NATO but would respond to the alliance’s attempts to advance its interests.

“The more such attempts there are, the harsher our responses will become,” Medvedev said. “Whether this will tear the entire planet apart depends solely on the prudence of the (NATO) side.”",0,"['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak, Emmanuel Macron and other G20 leaders will be in New Delhi for the 18th G20 Summit.

At the previous G20 summit in November 2022, hosted by the Indonesian G20 presidency in Bali, leaders discussed the impact of Russia’s war on Ukraine on the global economy, and in particular food and energy security. Despite issuing a joint declaration, Amnesty International believes that it has so far failed to be honoured and calls for its implementation, as well as for new commitments.

For years, experts have been warning humanity about the impact of global warming: as temperatures rise, there is concern about the world's food supply, rising sea levels and the fact that regions of the Earth are becoming too hot. to live. Now, in a study published in the journal 'Nature Geoscience', scientists have predicted the moment when humanity will witness the “triple extinction” event that will wipe out human beings and what will cause it. The study, led by the University of Bristol (UK), indicates that the Earth could become a hot, dry and largely uninhabitable supercontinent, with the entire landmass merging into one giant terrain – were used for the research the first supercomputer climate models of the distant future and showed that the world will have more volcanic eruptions that will emit huge plumes of carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures even further. The Sun could become hotter and brighter in the sky, heating the Earth more than ever and causing the average temperature to be between 40 and 50 degrees Celsius. According to Alexandrer Farnsworth, lead author of the study and senior research associate at the University of Bristol, “the newly emerged supercontinent would effectively create a triple whammy, comprising the effect of continentality, a hotter Sun and more CO2 in the atmosphere, increasing heat. across much of the planet.” The result is a hostile environment, without sources of food and water for mammals. Widespread temperatures between 40 and 50 degrees Celsius and even greater daily extremes, worsened by high humidity, would ultimately seal our fate. Humans — along with many other species — would die due to their inability to release this heat through sweat, cooling their bodies. According to the study, even if humanity stopped using fossil fuels, this would not prevent extinction. Even if humanity survives until the event, there will be total extinction. The only advantage is that the event is 250 million years away. Eunice Lo, co-author of the study and researcher in Climate Change and Health at the University of Bristol, said “it is vitally important not to lose sight of our current climate crisis, which results from human emissions of greenhouse gases.” “Although we are predicting an uninhabitable planet within 250 million years, today we are already experiencing extreme heat that is harmful to human health.

There are millions of fungi in the world. Although 150,000 are catalogued, scientists believe that the real number could vary between 1 and 5 million different species. However, a minority of them are at risk of infection. The group of researchers investigated 98 infections caused by fungi between 2009 and 2019, recorded in Chinese hospitals. They claim to have discovered a new species that causes infections. “We identified two independent cases of human infection with a previously undescribed invasive fungal pathogen,” the study says. Rhodosporidiobolus fluvialis was the identified species. In general, high body temperature prevents fungi from surviving. The researchers then carried out tests in laboratories with mice that were induced to a body temperature of 37ºC and discovered that this species of fungus not only remained alive, but recorded an increase in mutation rates, compared to milder temperatures. As a result of the accelerated mutation, fungi can become even more resistant to drugs, which would make it difficult to treat any disease. “Temperature-induced mutagenesis can also trigger the development of pan-resistance to three of the most widely used antifungals (fluconazole, caspofungin and amphotericin B),” the researchers say. The group also put forward the theory that rising global temperatures, as a result of the climate crisis, could encourage the spread of infectious diseases. “Global warming could promote the evolution of new fungal pathogens,” the article states.

Submerged houses in Lajeado (RS) this Wednesday (6) after a cyclone passed through. Recently affected by the formation of an extratropical cyclone in Rio Grande do Sul that killed more than 40 people, the southern region of the country registered 71 of the 92 alerts issued to the federal government in the last ten years due to this natural phenomenon. G1 analyzed data from the Integrated Disaster Information System, which receives daily alerts from Brazilian municipalities about the effects of natural phenomena. The system is linked to the Ministry of Integration and Regional Development. The South represents 77% of the alerts, due to the state of Santa Catarina, which registered 64 occurrences between January 2013 and August 2023. In the same period, five occurrences were registered in Rio Grande do Sul and two in Paraná. The city with the most cyclones was Balneário Barra do Sul (SC), with 13 episodes. See below a map with all the municipalities that issued a cyclone alert to the federal government in the last decade. Why in the South? Climatempo meteorologist Fábio Luengo explains that the southern states are historically more affected by extratropical cyclones due to their location in a zone where air masses meet. ""It is a region that has a greater thermal contrast between the hot and humid air (coming from the North) and the cold air that comes from the South [of the planet]"", he explains. What is unusual, says Luengo, is the intensity and frequency that these natural phenomena have gained. This week's extratropical cyclone, for example, marked the greatest natural tragedy in Rio Grande do Sul's history. Name three factors that explain this increase in extreme weather events. - Climate change, caused by human action on the planet, which increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events;

- Warming of the Atlantic Ocean, a process that is also more intense and frequent due to climate change;

A new storm hits Rio Grande do Sul, with unprecedented amounts of precipitation. In two days, it rained more than triple the average for the month of May. The frequency of meteorological disasters requires authorities to change the way they face them. This is the fifth climate scourge to hit Rio Grande do Sul in less than a year.

The support of the federal government is essential, which has already announced the sending of one hundred National Force agents and 31 transport vehicles. But, given the scale of the tragedy, which left thousands without homes and means of subsistence, in addition to the loss of loved ones, all action seems insufficient to alleviate such suffering. It seems clear that something abnormal is afoot and that global warming is at its root. Although extreme events can result from natural climate variation, this is increasingly unlikely. Public authorities therefore need to prepare for the worst-case scenarios. Nothing that happens now is unpredicted by science. It is still urgent to mitigate global warming by cutting greenhouse gas emissions more drastically and decisively than has been done so far — but in reality, they continue to rise worldwide. In the short and medium term, adapting to climate change should already be a priority for policymakers. The federal government, states and municipalities need to create integrated action plans to mitigate the effects of global warming and the fatalities caused by events, in areas such as forestry legislation, since green areas are essential to contain floods, and basic sanitation, which is shameful in Brazil. If there are obstacles to reducing and cutting carbon emissions at a global level, local authorities must take precautions to ensure that extreme events do not become, at the very least, catastrophic events.",0,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective']",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The 11 climate activists from the Climáximo movement, who this Tuesday morning began blocking the Second Circular, in Lisbon, from 9 am, during peak hour, in three of the four lanes in the Benfica-Airport direction, already were released by authorities after being arrested at the protest. The young people were released at 5pm from the PSP and Benfica police station, where they were being held. On the way out, there were some family members and colleagues from the movement, who clapped and shouted new slogans, calling for Government action to stop climate change. A sign was displayed that said “They are destroying everything you love.” “Fires, floods, droughts, heat waves that kill thousands of people. They know this and continue to increase emissions. We need peace and a disarmament of the weapons that are aimed at all of us”, said Noah Zino, one of the activists. The activists will be presented to the judge tomorrow, at 10am, at the Justice Campus, in Lisbon. Saying that they did not yet know the crimes of which they were accused, they admit that it is most likely that they will be charged with disobedience and disturbing public order. “We have stopped accepting a normality that kills more people every two days than died in Pedrogão Grande, in the fires. We will accompany anyone who wants to stop this genocide”, continued the activist, ensuring that actions of this type will continue to happen. Nine of the detained activists, who had cut the Second Circular, were taken away by a special police unit vehicle, and the two hanging from the viaduct ended up being removed by the authorities, especially the Lisbon Sapadores Firefighters, and detained. Several INEM ambulances, two cars from the Lisbon Firefighters Sapadores with more than 10 officers, four cars from the special police unit and five officers from the Prevention and Immediate Reaction Team (EPRI) of the metropolitan command of the PSP of Lisbon were mobilized to the scene. . Remember here the videos of the protest and chaos this morning in Lisbon:

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate change will lead to an average rise in global sea levels of between 32 and 84 centimeters by 2100. Researchers from financial comparison service Money.co.uk have produced travel posters imagining the impact of dramatic sea level rise in famous destinations. Although exaggerated, the artworks are a way to draw attention to the plight faced by many coastal areas due to rising sea levels. However, there are several destinations that are likely to be affected by rising sea levels over the next hundred years. The team created a map of tourist destinations around the world that are at risk of flooding and even disappearing completely. Fiji, a country where the economy is largely dependent on tourism, has already started to see the effects of rising sea levels, with research showing that water levels will continue to rise to 1-2 meters by 2100, which puts the island at risk of being completely submerged. Seychelles, Solomon Islands and Palau are also at risk of disappearing by 2100, which would be a devastating loss for the planet. Some of the world’s most popular tourist destinations, including London, Dubai, Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro, are vulnerable to extreme flooding by 2100. In Dubai, a three-meter rise would cause the city to lose much of its infrastructure. If sea levels rise by nine meters, Dubai could be completely submerged, making it the shortest-lived urban infrastructure in human history. The Maldives – famous for its iconic overwater villas – could lose up to 77% of its land area to the sea by 2100, according to some experts.",0,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Access to 14 villages in the southern Russian Belgorod region bordering Ukraine will be closed to most civilians, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said Tuesday, citing the “extremely difficult” situation due to Ukrainian shelling. Announcing the new restrictions in a video posted on his Telegram channel, Gladkov said that starting next week, only adult men accompanying military or government officials will be allowed to enter the settlements. Men must travel in armored vehicles and wear bulletproof vests and helmets, he added. “I hope you will agree that it is unacceptable to allow women and children to enter the settlements that are shelled every day,” Gladkov said. “We have already lost too many civilians, we have too many wounded. And of course, our task is to maximize security measures.” The Belgorod region has come under frequent fire from Ukrainian shelling and drones. Air raid sirens sound almost daily in the regional capital of the same name, just 40km north of the border. Ukraine says Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities has been devastating and, after nearly two and a half years of war, Russian forces are now in control of about a fifth of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in May that Russian forces were working to create a buffer zone in northeastern Ukraine to protect Russia from attacks launched by Kiev’s forces across the border. Gladkov’s announcement is a sign that the security situation in the region may have become more dire, prompting authorities to do more to protect civilians. More than 200 civilians have been killed in the Belgorod region since the start of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine in February 2022, Gladkov told the state-run Tass news agency on Tuesday.

""The plans of the Western minority to isolate Russia and create a kind of cordon sanitaire around us have failed. The promoters of these initiatives themselves are forced to admit this,"" said Sergei Lavrov, during a speech in the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament), quoted by the official news agency TASS. In his speech, Lavrov considered that the West, led by the United States, used the ""Kiev regime"" to achieve these goals, in addition to having made available ""a wide arsenal of hybrid warfare tools"", including economic and diplomatic sanctions, which also covered the sectors of information, culture and sports. However, he stressed that the ""collective hostility"" of the West also allowed the emergence of ""new opportunities"" to direct Russia's relations in ""various geographical directions"", giving as examples China and Africa, which has become ""one of the poles of the emerging multipolar world"". Lavrov, who will visit Cuba, Venezuela and Brazil next week, noted that during his visit to Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday and Thursday - where he will participate in the G20 foreign ministers' summit (the world's 20 largest economies) - Russia will continue to oppose ""selfish goals"" that have emerged within the group, including ""the 'Ukrainianization' of the agenda."" Still on Ukraine, Lavrov reiterated that Russia is willing to start negotiations, as long as its ""legitimate interests"" are respected, which are completely contradictory to Ukrainian demands, which are committed to recovering the entire territory. These words from the Russian Foreign Minister follow statements from other Russian sources who, on Tuesday, assured that Russian President Vladimir Putin's suggestion of a ceasefire in Ukraine and negotiations, following contacts between intermediaries last December, was rejected by the United States of America (USA). An official US source denied on condition of anonymity that there had been any formal contact and said that Washington would not engage in negotiations that excluded Ukraine. The Russian military offensive on Ukrainian territory, launched on February 24, 2022, plunged Europe into what is considered the most serious security crisis since the Second World War (1939-1945).

Ukraine has received its first Western F-16 fighter jets, which have been expected for more than two years, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced today, showing them to reporters and stressing that their number is “insufficient”. “We have held hundreds of meetings and negotiations” with allies to obtain these planes and strengthen the country’s air defense and “we often hear the words ‘it is impossible’ in response,” Volodymyr Zelensky said during a ceremony at a secret location in Ukraine, according to AFP. “Now it is reality, reality in our skies.

According to the Reuters news agency, Toroczkai's words were spoken at a party press conference, which was also attended by leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Forum for Democracy, among others.

The month of August begins to approach but summer seems to remain far away. Pedro Sousa, meteorologist at the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA) confirms that, this week, “we are witnessing an episode of hot weather” and, last week, “there were also some”. The heat that is being felt at the end of July is “relatively normal” and the meteorologist classifies these periods as typical “summer heat”. “Without records and without very prolonged heat episodes, it has been a calm summer”, admits the meteorologist. And it is, in fact, like that, especially because there have been many complaints that the heat arrived late. For August, temperatures are expected to be above average in the interior and below average on the coast, says Pedro Sousa. The weeks are therefore predicted to be dry and hot, with cooler trends on the coast. “The probability of August being hot is high”, he explains, due to the global warming trend over the years and also the El Niño phenomenon which, “whenever it happens, the planet experiences high temperatures”. Furthermore, there are ocean anomalies above normal which cause the sea to become warmer, which also reduces the influence of the sea breeze on temperature. Despite this, the IPMA meteorologist warns that this is not an absolute certainty, as “forecasts are losing reliability” and a “forecast for three weeks from now can always change”. “Forecasts change quickly,” he concludes. Comparing the temperature of August 2024 with the last three decades, he highlights, the meteorology of the next month should be higher, but “nothing guarantees that it will be hotter than last year or 2018”, which were marked by temperature phenomena . “The predicted and observed temperatures are above those of the last thirty years, which does not mean that they are very high”, he explains. The end of July and the first week of August are predicted to be hot and dry with above average interior and negative anomalies on the coast. “The normal summer thing,” says the expert.

Water scarcity has led some Greek islands to ban the use of swimming pools and resort to desalination. Just weeks after Greece faced its earliest-ever heat wave in June, several parts of the country are now dealing with a new crisis: severe water shortages. An emergency has been declared in Sifnos, the Cyclades, Leros, the Dodecanese islands, Sami, Cephalonia, and parts of Crete. Residents of these regions are demanding urgent intervention as water resources become depleted. Water levels are also low on the Attica peninsula, which encompasses Athens. On the southern Aegean island of Naxos, the largest reservoir has dried up due to low rainfall and hot weather, according to Reuters news agency. The lack of rain in recent months, combined with scorching temperatures of up to 40ºC, has caused this situation. Inadequate infrastructure and lack of maintenance of desalination units on the islands further aggravated the problem. Forest fires also contributed to the crisis. In June, a fire on Serifos destroyed part of the island's water supply network, which now faces its lowest water reserves in 20 years. With the maximum need for water for supply and irrigation, farmers are the most affected. Many are being forced to turn to seawater-contaminated wells due to low water levels, Reuters reports. With the tourist season in full swing, visitor infrastructure is putting further pressure on water resources. Increased construction and uncontrolled use of swimming pools have contributed to water shortages on the islands, Elissavet Feloni, a hydrologist and professor at the University of West Attica, told Greek channel Naftemporiki. Last month was the hottest June on record globally and the 13th consecutive month of record temperatures, according to European climate service Copernicus. It was also the 12th month in a row in which the world was 1.5ºC warmer than in pre-industrial times, extremes attributed to man-made emissions. With dry conditions expected to persist in the coming months, Feloni called for controls on water consumption and stricter government monitoring. Some islands have already taken action on their own. Karpathos and Serifos have imposed restrictions on refilling swimming pools. In Viannos, Crete, strict limits have been set on the use of water for irrigation. The small Dodecanese island of Lipsi has gone ahead and banned the construction of swimming pools in the hot summer of 2023 to encourage a more sustainable approach to tourism. The northern island of Thassos is investing in a desalination plant to make its seawater drinkable, according to Reuters. In places where an emergency was declared, processes for transferring water, improving supplies and accessing government funds were accelerated. Three new wells are planned in Crete, while the navy has transported water to Leros, according to local press reports.

In recent years, with the recognition of climate change as a global phenomenon, a mode of protest has spread, from young ‘climate activists’. Integrated into anti-system vanguard parties, which, believing they are saving the world from the apocalypse, consider themselves above the Law. The protests of these activists or radicals take different forms. All over the world, they stick to works of art to draw attention to their causes, usually forgetting that those works of art represent the best that the human spirit has produced over thousands of years of existence. Another form of protest they encounter is by sticking themselves to the ground in the most diverse places, occupying a space that is not theirs, believing that they can freely impose themselves on others. We have already had a few episodes like these here, some of them involving the pretense of believing that they are the only ones who care about the future of the planet and Humanity, intending to represent the vanguard of contemporary society. They interrupted a private event where the Minister of Economy was present. They invaded and stuck to the floor of the Ministry of Economy. They blocked access to the building where the Council of Ministers was supposed to meet. In another case, the leader of the JS of Oeiras, after insulting the Municipal Executive in a session of the Oeiras Municipal Assembly, addressed the Executive's bench throwing a 10 euro note, in order to reinforce the municipal budget in the fight against climate change. This week, the holders of truth and above good and evil, invaded a CNN conference where the Minister of the Environment was present, attacking the minister with bags of green paint, protesting against the minister's presence at an event supported by companies of the energy sector. All of this is possible and all of this is tolerated because the poor 'young free radicals' are drawing attention to a greater cause, and because they want to save Humanity from itself. In reality, all of this is tolerated because the vast majority of the political class, as well as other institutions, live in a state of cowardly surrender to political correctness. Politicians are insulted or subjected to insinuations and are afraid to react. Fear is the worst advisor for decision makers. Governments, and the President of the Republic, have been particularly responsible for establishing this state of affairs. Portugal is a country absolutely conditioned by these groups, and by the hand that rocks their cradle. A substantial part of blocking national decisions involves imposed public conditioning (with strong support from newsrooms), and this conditioning afflicts our society with fear. Yesterday it was public that 40% of judges admit to being conditioned by the media. How many of the remaining 60% still don't tell the truth?

Italian environmentalists used dye to dye Venice's Grand Canal green on Saturday (9) in protest against what they considered a lack of progress at COP28, the UN Climate Change Conference taking place in Dubai until next Tuesday (12). Hanging from the Rialto Bridge over the canal with the help of climbing ropes, activists from the group Extinction Rebellion also displayed a banner that read: ""COP28: While the government talks, we are hanging by a thread"". Small stretches of rivers and canals in other Italian cities have also been dyed green in similar protests. ""In a few hours, these waters will be back to what they were before,"" the group said in a statement. ""In the meantime, we count the damage and victims of the constant floods and fires."" According to the protesters, the visual effect was created by a dye used by companies to track items in the water. Boat traffic was halted during the protest, and the canal water and columns had to be checked for safety reasons, according to Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro. The politician criticized the activists' actions, calling them ""eco-vandals,"" and called on Italian authorities to punish them. ""Venice is a fragile city that must be loved and respected! Enough is enough,"" he said. Brugnaro borrowed the nickname given to the protesters from figures such as the current Italian Minister of Culture, Gennaro Sangiuliano. The head of the department is waging a crusade against protests by environmentalists who target monuments and works of art — acts that have become more common in recent years. In April, the government of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni announced a bill that provides for stricter fines, between 10,000 and 60,000 euros, for those who destroy, tarnish or disfigure, totally or partially, cultural and scenic assets. The measures were added to sanctions already present in the penal code for this type of crime, which currently reach five years in prison and a fine of R$15,000. “Whoever damages our artistic heritage cannot and should not get away with it,” said the ultra-rightist on social media at the time.",0,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other']",1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Three out of four young people aged 16 to 25 consider the “climate future frightening” and fear that world leaders will not be able to implement effective measures. This is according to the survey Young People’s Voices on Climate Anxiety, Government Betrayal and Moral Injury: A Global Phenomenon, which interviewed 10,000 people from countries such as the US, India, France, Nigeria and Brazil in September. The survey also showed that 45% of these young people feel distressed, overwhelmed, anxious and guilty about the environment. These figures explain and reflect the leading role that young people are demanding – albeit by force – in decisions to combat the climate crisis. “Our leaders are not our leaders. This is what a leader should look like”, said Greta Thunberg, pointing to the thousands of young people listening to her in Glasgow. In Glasgow, young people from all over the world called for greater participation and representation in the negotiations. A declaration signed by 40,000 of them was delivered to the COP presidency and other leaders. “Youth action and scrutiny are essential to keeping the 1.5 degrees Celsius target alive and creating a zero-emissions future,” said Alok Sharma, president of the Conference. The Brazilian delegation included around 80 young people, the largest youth representation to date. And the only Brazilian to participate in the COP-26 opening ceremony was Txai Suruí, a 24-year-old indigenous girl. He shared the stage with António Guterres, UN Secretary General, and Boris Johnson, British Prime Minister, and spoke to diplomats from more than 190 countries. In his speech, Txai cited the murder of Ari Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, his friend and indigenous guardian killed in 2020 for protecting nature, and warned about the urgency for change. “Today the weather is getting warmer; animals are disappearing; the rivers are dying; our crops don't flourish like they used to. The Earth is speaking. It tells us we don’t have any more time.”

The negative impact of passenger vehicles on the climate, which is considerable, could have fallen by more than 30% in the last decade if not for the world's appetite for large cars, suggests a new report from the Global Fuel Economy Initiative. Transportation is responsible for about a quarter of all climate-warming gases from energy, and much of that can be attributed to passenger transport, according to the International Energy Agency. But the negative environmental impact of SUVs could have been reduced by more than a third between 2010 and 2022 if people had continued to buy the same size cars, according to the initiative, a global partnership of cleaner vehicle groups. One solution to this could be electric vehicles (EVs). George Parrott, a 79-year-old avid runner who lives in West Sacramento, California, decided to switch to cleaner vehicles in 2004 when he purchased a hybrid Toyota Prius. Since then, he has owned several pure electric cars and currently has a Genesis GV60 electric SUV and a Tesla Model 3. Not all consumers feel the same way about energy consumption and environmental benefits, especially in the US. While EV sales accounted for 15 percent of the global auto market last year, that share was just 7.3 percent in the U.S. Meanwhile, smaller vehicles, or sedans, have lost a lot of ground in the U.S. market over the past decade. In 2012, sedans accounted for 50 percent of U.S. auto retail space, with SUVs at just over 30 percent and trucks at 13.5 percent, according to the auto-buying firm Edmunds. By 2022, sedans’ share in the U.S. had fallen to 21 percent, while SUVs reached 54.5 percent and trucks had grown to 20 percent. “People don’t want to be limited by the space in their car,” said Eric Frehsée, president of the Tamaroff Group of dealerships in southeast Michigan. “Everybody wants a seven-passenger car.” “It was all a combination of broad environmental concerns,” he said. More efforts are underway by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to improve the fuel economy and tailpipe emissions of gasoline-powered vehicles.

The Rio Negro, in Manaus, reached its third lowest level this Friday, the 13th, at 13.93 meters. The level is 28 centimeters away from breaking the record low level recorded in 2010, when the river reached 13.63 meters. With the low level, the city of Manaus issued a statement reinforcing the closure of Ponta Negra beach, which has been closed to bathers since October 2nd. The decision to close the beach for bathing, for reasons of safety and to prevent drowning, is due to the proximity between the end of the perennial landfill and the natural riverbed, which may present changes in the terrain, such as holes, unevenness and depressions. Last Monday, October 9th, the beach was fenced off to physically delimit the area where bathers are prohibited, with signs measuring 1.20 meters high and 1,500 meters long. This physical restriction is intended to prevent people from passing through and to raise awareness among those who insist on bathing in the river in the restricted section. Climate change is altering the landscape in several parts of the country

The Negro River has seen a very rapid decline, with a reduction of more than 7 meters in water column in just 20 days in September. The explanation lies in the El Niño phenomenon, which has prolonged the intensity of the drought in Amazonas. The capital of Amazonas declared a state of emergency on September 28th due to the drought. Furthermore, the city hall also recommended that the population not practice physical activities. This is because Manaus was once again covered in smoke. “I recommend not practicing sports. You can't breathe carbon monoxide, which causes problems. As a result, we will postpone our city's marathon, which was scheduled for the weekend.

Several tourists were forced to be evacuated from hotels in Greece due to the threat posed by the numerous forest fires spreading across the country: according to the British from 'The Independent', firefighters fought fires on the islands of Chios and Kos, in the east of the Aegean Sea, this Monday, which injured five people. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has already warned of a dangerous summer ahead, highlighting that the population's help was essential to limit the impact of forest fires: it is worth remembering that in 2023 20 people died in forest fires during the summer months . Greece has experienced a recent past marked by several forest fires: however, hotter, drier and windier weather, which scientists associate with the effects of climate change, has increased their frequency and intensity. On Monday morning, emergency services issued evacuation orders for people in the Metohi area of ​​western Chios to move to a nearby beach – by evening, more than 140 firefighters, along with eight specialist teams in forest fires, seven planes and three helicopters were fighting the fire. According to fire department spokesman Vasilis Vathrakoyiannis, two firefighters were slightly injured: state television 'ERT' later reported that two other firefighters and a volunteer suffered non-life-threatening burns. “The situation remains difficult in Chios, and all Civil Protection forces will make great efforts to limit it,” assured Vathrakoyiannis. Further south in the Aegean, another fire broke out on the tourist island of Kos, which forced the evacuation of several people, including tourists from hotels as a precaution: the fire was fought by more than 100 firefighters, including reinforcements sent from Athens, as well as six planes and two helicopters, Vathrakoyiannis added.

An international study with the participation of Maria João Feio and Manuel Graça, researchers from the Center for Marine and Environmental Sciences (MARE) at the Faculty of Science and Technology of the University of Coimbra (FCTUC), published in the journal Nature, concluded that, despite From the positive trends of the 90s, from 2010 onwards, the recovery of river biodiversity has stagnated. In Europe, over the last three decades, and especially after the publication of the Water Framework Directive in 2000, several mitigation measures have been implemented to combat the degradation of rivers and their ecosystems. However, the number of factors threatening these ecosystems continues to increase around the world. Thus, «this study aimed to analyze whether, over the last few decades, there has effectively been a recovery of aquatic biodiversity in riverine systems over time, as a result of mitigation measures implemented in Europe, and what factors determined this», he explains. Maria João Feio, adding that it was possible to conclude «that there really was a small increase in the number of species (0.73% per year), functional richness (2.4% per year) and abundance (1.7% per year) in the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities'. However, the researcher continues, «despite these positive trends, the number of species still decreased in 30% of the sites. The riverine ecosystems where there was less recovery were those located downstream of dams, in urban areas and agricultural lands. Furthermore, invertebrate communities located in areas with faster warming rates had less recovery, which shows the impacts of climate change, namely the effect of increasing temperatures», he warns. According to experts, the increases seen in biodiversity mainly occurred before the 2010s and have since stagnated. Gains in biodiversity in the 1990s and 2000s reflect the improvement in the physical-chemical quality of water, due to the implementation of more effective treatment systems and ecological rehabilitation or restoration projects. The slowdown in the recovery of riverine biodiversity in the 2010s shows that current measures are not sufficient, resulting in fewer and fewer positive results in the recovery of biodiversity. This stagnation, says the researcher, “occurred because new threats also emerged, namely emerging pollutants, such as medicines and microplastics, climate change and invasive species. In fact, the number of non-native species (found in 69% of the locations analyzed) has been increasing sharply (4% per year)», he states. Given these results, the researchers consider it «urgent to continue ecological restoration based on the renaturalization and recovery of species, not merely aesthetic, or focused on runoff, or the removal of nutrients from the water, but also on new planning focused on new impacts, such as such as emerging pollutants, climate change and invasive species. Furthermore, the research also shows the importance of continuing the ecological monitoring of rivers so that studies can be carried out that address temporal evolutions», they conclude.

578,PT_58.txt,"Climate crisis could impact insects’ sex lives, study finds

In cold weather, an insect with a darker body is better at capturing a mate than a rival with a brighter structure. Darker males can warm up more easily in the early morning and therefore have more time to mate while others are still warming up. This is one of many examples of how temperature affects insects’ coloration and, in turn, can affect their ability to mate, according to a new review paper published in the journal Ecology and Evolution and reported by the Guardian. Scientists are still trying to figure out what will happen to insects’ sex lives now that man-made climate breakdown is pushing temperatures to unprecedented levels. “On the one hand, we could be happy and say, ‘How are the insects? They’re responding to climate change. We don’t need to worry about them,’” said Mariella Herberstein, a behavioral ecologist at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, who is one of the study’s authors. The prevailing theory among scientists, Herberstein says, is that as temperatures rise, insects largely evolve to produce less of the pigment that regulates their hue, becoming lighter and brighter. That’s because darker objects absorb more heat and warm up more quickly, while lighter objects reflect more radiation and can stay cooler longer. For example, the wing colors of some North American mountain butterflies have faded over time as temperatures have risen—their bright sulfur-yellow wings have become paler, according to a 2016 study. Between the 1980s and 2000s, it became increasingly unlikely that the two-spotted ladybug would be black with red spots rather than red with black spots. But Herberstein’s team found that the pattern isn’t always that simple. A follow-up study of Meadii butterflies, which looked at more than 800 animals collected for museum specimens between 1953 and 2013, found that in some areas, their yellow wings became richer and darker in color over time. “The mechanism is not so clear – it’s confusing,” said another of the study’s authors, Tonmoy Haque, a PhD student at Macquarie University. This may be because the researchers are working with a limited set of data from similar studies on similar insects, he says. It’s also likely because melanin doesn’t just have a heat-related function, but is involved in immune defenses and helps protect against ultraviolet radiation from the sun.",0,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The investigation comes as Kyiv tries to crack down on corruption in an attempt to accelerate its membership of the European Union and NATO, one of the conditions imposed by European partners. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected on an anti-corruption platform in 2019, long before Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Both the president and his aides have touted the recent dismissals of senior officials, notably Ivan Bakanov, former - head of the State Security Service, in July 2022, as proof of his efforts to crack down on corruption. Security officials say the current investigation dates back to August 2022, when officials signed a contract to purchase artillery shells worth 1.5 billion hryvnias (€37 million) with arms company Lviv Arsenal. After receiving payment, company officials were supposed to transfer the funds to a company registered abroad, which would then deliver the ammunition. However, the goods were never delivered and the money was sent to various accounts in Ukraine and the Balkans, according to investigators. The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office says the funds have since been seized and will be returned to the country's defense budget. Meanwhile, Ukraine reported a wave of Russian attacks on its infrastructure in several regions of the country on Tuesday, and Russia announced that it had repelled new Ukrainian advances in Kharkiv and Donetsk. Zaporizhia was one of the worst-hit regions, having seen at least 130 Russian shellings in the past 24 hours, according to the head of the Ukrainian regional administration, Yuri Malasko. At least 24 communities were hit by shelling in 33 drone strikes. Another 15 communities in the Sumy region were hit by Russian shelling, according to the Ukrainian military administration in the region, in a message also posted on its Telegram account. ""Ninety-one explosions were recorded at the regional level,"" according to the authorities. Russia, for its part, said today that its forces repelled five attacks and counterattacks by assault groups of two brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the direction of Kupiansk, near Sinkovka, in the Kharkiv region, and Terniv, in Donetsk. ""The motorized rifle units of the group, in cooperation with artillery, repelled two attacks and three counterattacks by the assault groups of the 32nd mechanized brigade and the 103rd Ukrainian territorial defense brigade in the Sinkovka and Ternov areas.

Russian troops in the Donetsk direction have taken advantageous positions with the Yug (South) grouping of troops, the losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have reached 175 servicemen, the Russian Defense Ministry reported on Monday (25). At the same time, it said that Russia destroyed six military vehicles, including a Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, as well as a Krab self-propelled artillery system, a Rapira anti-tank gun and two Nota and Anklav-N radars.

In the Kupyansk and Kherson directions, Ukrainian casualties in the last 24 hours amounted to about 60 men in combat with Russian forces, and an attempted attack on Russian troops failed, which used the efforts of units of the Zapad (West) and Dnieper troop groups to also destroy two cars, nine pick-ups and a Gvozdika self-propelled artillery system. Meanwhile, according to the Russian military body, in the Avdeevka and southern Donetsk directions, the Ukrainian Armed Forces conducted ten unsuccessful counterattack attempts and lost some of their positions, but Russia, with the Vostok (East) and Tsentr (Center) troop groupings, destroyed about 230 personnel, 13 military vehicles, an Akatsiya self-propelled artillery system, an AN/TPQ-48 radar and other Ukrainian weapons.

582,PT_60.txt,"Earth's core is slowing down and may rotate in the opposite direction; understand how this affects the planet

Radical natural phenomena and events caused by climate change are scaring people about the future. Concerns apparently grew after a group of scientists recently suggested that the rotation of the Earth's core is slowing down and may start rotating in the opposite direction. The theory was presented in a study published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience. According to the publication, the process began in 2019 and the new cycle may last up to 70 years, with the possibility of changing the length of days. However, the researchers reinforce that this is a structural phenomenon of the Earth and not a catastrophic event. The authors of the research used seismic records to understand the change in the rotation of the Earth's core, and claim that this process may be related to some natural disasters. After analyzing data on the planet's inner core between the 1990s and 2020, scientists identified a noticeable change in recent years. On the other hand, this hypothesis does not come from these researchers alone. Professor John Vidale, dean of Earth Sciences at the California Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences (USC Dornsife), explained in an article in Nature Geoscience that the planet has undergone a slow deceleration until it began to spin in reverse in recent years. This new movement would cause major changes in the functioning of all forms of life on Earth. The scientific community concluded that the rotation of the core is not completely consistent, as it seemed to be constantly slowing down. Even so, experts emphasize that understanding the Earth's core is extremely difficult because direct observations are impossible. “Here we analyze repeated seismic waves from the early 1990s and show that all paths that previously showed significant temporal changes have shown little change over the last decade. This globally consistent pattern suggests that the differential rotation of the inner core has recently stopped,” says the study. Why is the Earth's core spinning backwards? The first discovery about the functioning of the Earth's inner core was made in a study conducted by seismologist Inge Lehmann in 1936. At that time, the Danish woman realized that this region functioned like a ""solid metal ball."" On the other hand, research into the variation in the core's rotation speed occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. Then, in the early 1990s, the first seismological evidence was released. Researchers used data from seismic waves and earthquakes to understand interactions with the planet's inner core. Even so, there are disagreements among scientists about this theory. Some of them argue that the data is still limited due to the difficulty of gathering samples and making accurate observations.",0,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Russian Defense Ministry announced Saturday that Russian forces had taken control of the town of Lozuvatske in the Pokrovsk sector of Ukraine’s Donetsk region, the site of some of the fiercest frontline fighting in the 29-month war. Ukraine’s General Staff did not mention the town in its report, but said the area around it had been engulfed in heavy fighting. Unofficial military sources reported the loss of at least two other towns in the sector. Russian forces have been advancing slowly through the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, making steady, incremental gains since taking the key town of Avdiivka in February. The Russian Defense Ministry said the “central” group of Russian forces had captured Lozuvatske, northwest of the Russian-held regional center of Donetsk. Russia also said its forces launched strikes elsewhere in the sector and repelled three Ukrainian counterattacks. Ukrainian authorities have reported for several weeks that the Pokrovsk sector is experiencing the heaviest fighting along the 1,000-kilometer front line. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy discussed the sector twice on Thursday with his top commander, Olexandr Syrskyi.

Javier Milei believes in property rights and the privatization of natural resources to solve environmental problems. Why are whales becoming extinct but chickens are not? Global warming? “Nothing, it's another lie of socialism. There's a whole agenda of cultural Marxism,” said Javier Milei, the anarcho-capitalist President-elect of Argentina, with a hairstyle that resembles an out-of-fashion football player. He doesn't believe in climate change, wants to abolish the Ministry of the Environment (among many others), privatize the Ministry of Science and believes in private property as a way to regulate pollution. Climate change is not the fault of humans, he said, against all scientific evidence. “The world has had other peaks of high temperatures. It's a cyclical behavior, independent of the existence of man. Therefore, all these policies that blame humans for climate change are false and only serve to raise funds to finance lazy socialists who write fifth-rate documents,” he said in the second debate with Sergio Massa, the defeated candidate. s
Milei’s speech became famous in which he said that “a company can pollute a river however it wants.” Pause: “And? Where is the damage?” The problem, said the far-right politician, is that property rights are poorly defined. An economist, former rock singer and former football goalkeeper, among other colorful biographical details, Javier Milei defines himself as a libertarian who believes in defining property rights to solve potential environmental problems. “A company can pollute a river however it wants, and do you know why? Because this is a society where there is plenty of water and the price of water is zero. Consequently, who is going to claim ownership rights to that river? No one, because they can’t make money,” he said. Now, if someone owns the water in that river, they will have an interest in negotiating with those who pollute it. “They will see how the contamination is going to end,” said Milei. These policies that blame humans for climate change are false and only serve to raise funds to finance lazy socialists who write fifth-rate documents. His main advisor, Alberto Benegas Lynch, illustrated the idea that involves the widespread privatization of state resources and assets using whales. “Why are whales on the brink of extinction, while chickens and cows are not? The difference is in the fence that protects them. Where there is an owner, there is economic benefit, and this protects the fauna,” he said, suggesting privatizing the sea.",0,"['CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Downplaying climate change: Other', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives', 'CC: Downplaying climate change: Climate cycles are natural', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures']",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A severe heat wave in the eastern Indian states of Bihar and Odisha could have caused the deaths of at least 24 people from heatstroke, local officials said. This extreme weather phenomenon is expected to last until Saturday. India has been buffeted by an extremely hot summer and a part of the capital, Delhi, this week recorded the country's highest-ever temperature at 52.9 degrees Celsius, although this figure may be revised after the meteorological department Check the weather station sensors that recorded the reading. While temperatures in northwest and central India will come down in the coming days, the heat wave prevailing in eastern India is likely to continue for two days, said the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which declares a heat wave when the temperature is 4.5 to 6.4 degrees Celsius higher than normal. 14 people died in Bihar on Thursday, officials said, including ten people who were working on organizing the seven-phase national elections that are currently underway. Citizens of some parts of Bihar will vote this Saturday. Authorities told Reuters that ten people died at the government hospital in Odisha's Rourkela region on Thursday. The Odisha government has banned outdoor activities for its employees between 11am and 3pm, when temperatures peak. Three people have died of suspected heatstroke in the state of Jharkhand, neighboring Bihar, local media reported. Animals in suffering

In Delhi, where high temperatures have caused wild birds and monkeys to faint or become ill, the city's zoo is turning to swimming pools and sprinklers to relieve its 1,200 occupants. “We have switched to a summer diet, which includes a more liquid diet as well as all seasonal fruits and vegetables that contain more water,” Sanjeet Kumar, director of the zoo, told news agency ANI. New Delhi, where temperatures are expected to reach 43 degrees Celsius on Friday, recorded its first heat-related death this week and faces severe water shortages. Thousands of people across Asia, including neighboring Pakistan, have been struggling with rising temperatures – a trend that scientists say has been worsened by human-caused climate change.

Wet-bulb temperatures are rising around the world, and Earth's climate has begun to exceed the 35°C threshold. A study by NASA, the American space agency, showed that some places in the world could become uninhabitable in the coming decades because of climate change. According to the report, areas of the Central-West, Northeast, North and Southeast of Brazil are included in a study that mapped five regions. Colin Raymond, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and author of a 2020 study on extreme heat and humidity, analyzes that ""climate models tell us that certain regions are likely to exceed these temperatures [35ºC] in the next 30 to 50 years "". In addition to Brazil, Raymond mentions South and parts of Southeast Asia, East China, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. The US is not immune either: Within 50 years, the country's Midwestern states such as Arkansas, Missouri and Iowa will likely be in dire straits as well. The 35ºC reported in the research refers to the wet-bulb temperature used as a standard for measuring heat and humidity, especially in long-term global climate research. According to Raymond, this is the highest wet-bulb temperature that humans can survive when exposed for at least six hours. Wet-bulb temperatures are rising around the world, and Earth's climate has begun to surpass this 35°C threshold.

A 4-meter-long pink dolphin, made by artist Gil Reais, was the protagonist of Brazil's first protest action at COP28, in Dubai, held this Sunday (3). The initiative, entitled “Boto Alerta: Queremos nadar na água, não no petrol!”, was carried out by the youth organization Engajamundo, in partnership with Greenpeace Brasil, in the Blue Zone of the UN climate conference. The objective was to denounce the socio-environmental impacts that oil exploration in the Amazon region can cause, one of the issues that is clouding Brazil's presence at the first COP of the Lula government. Brazil's protest at COP28 inspired by the death of dolphins

The inspiration for the sculpture was the death of dolphins impacted by the severe drought of the last period, representing the fauna and oil exploration in the Amazon River Basin. For Marcelo Laterman, spokesperson for Greenpeace Brazil, the action carried out in partnership with Engajamundo denounces the contradiction of the Brazilian government in defending the expansion of oil frontiers in the country, especially in sensitive areas such as the Amazon, while at the same time seeking to reposition the country in a leading role in the climate agenda. “These young activists are creatively sending an important message: there is no virtuous future for the Amazon with the advance of oil in the region. The opening of this new frontier could be marked as President Lula’s worst socio-environmental legacy. The government must fulfill its promises and defend the Amazon, its people and face the climate crisis responsibly.” According to Engajamundo, between 2012 and 2020, the number of oil fields in the Amazon increased by 13% and, if this new frontier on the Amazon coast is opened, this number will increase exponentially. Brazil is the 9th largest oil producer in the world. Engajamundo and Greenpeace criticize Basil’s entry as an observer in OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), in the middle of COP28, “which shows that the country and its leaders still have oil as an economic priority, despite speeches in defense of decarbonization.” Jaciara Borari is one of the indigenous activists from Engajamundo and is part of the delegation that organized this action. “We want the protest at COP28 to somehow express the urgency of this agenda reaching decision-makers, and for the process of oil exploration in the Amazon River Basin to be rethought and stopped. “We still have time to avoid a major disaster that has been announced!” warns the activist.",0,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other']",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some of the most high-profile actions have included road closures, disruptions of motorsport and winter sports events, confrontations with politicians, disruptions of theatre performances, cementing cars, disrupting shareholder meetings of fossil fuel companies, disrupting marathons and, most recently, protests at airports. Now the group has announced an end to the protest actions, at least until it finds new ways to make its voice heard.

Lula added that the ""objective is to establish the conditions to expand and accelerate public policies based on a national plan to face extreme climate risks"". According to the proposal presented in the election, the National Authority for Climate Change would have the objective of monitoring the measures taken by the government to reduce the emission of gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. After the victory, the proposal was put aside. One of the reasons given was budgetary constraints. Lula traveled to Amazonas accompanied by ministers Rui Costa (Chief of Staff), Marina Silva (Environment), José Múcio Monteiro (Defense), Nizia Trindade (Health), Wellington Dias (Social Development) and Silvio Costa Filho (Ports and Airports). The president announced an investment of 81.8 million euros in dredging interventions in the rivers of the state of Amazonas, to facilitate navigation in the midst of the drought. He also promised to pave a 20-kilometer stretch of the BR-319 highway, at a cost of 25.8 million euros. During his speech, Lula also criticized the administration of his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro (PL). ""The previous plan for the environment was clear; it was to open the gate to let the cattle through. And we think that we can even raise cattle, but it is not necessary to destroy the forest and our planet in order to raise them. And that is why we are treating it with great decency."" The Amazon has been recording below-average rainfall since July. In recent weeks, fires have left cities and even indigenous territories engulfed in smoke. On August 27, 1,516 fires were recorded in the Amazon, according to the monitoring panel of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE): 39% in Pará, 29% in Amazonas, 12% in Acre, 10% in Rondônia and 8% in Mato Grosso. In July, the Amazon experienced its worst July since the beginning of the historical series of fires, in 1998.

The world once again had its hottest day on record, on Monday (22), surpassing Sunday (21), which had also broken a record, according to preliminary data from a European Union monitoring agency. With heat waves around the world and wildfires in parts of the Mediterranean, Russia and Canada, the global average surface air temperature rose to 17.15 degrees Celsius (°C) on Monday. That number was 0.06°C higher than Sunday's record, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, which has been tracking this data since 1940. This includes temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere, which is currently in winter, which reduces the world average. Scientists said it's possible Tuesday and Wednesday this week could surpass Monday's record again. Until then, the record hot day was recorded in July 2023, when the average daily peak was broken for four consecutive days – from July 3rd to 6th. Before that, the record was recorded in August 2016. El-niño

What makes this year's record unusual is that, unlike 2023 and 2016, in April the world exited the El Niño weather pattern, which typically raises global temperatures due to warmer-than-normal waters in the Eastern Pacific. Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Leipzig in Germany, said it is remarkable that the record has been broken again now that the world is in the ""neutral"" phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. This points to the greater influence than ever of climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, on rising global temperatures. ""Last Monday may have set a new world record for the hottest absolute global average temperature ever, that is, tens of thousands of years ago,"" Haustein said. China has issued a series of heat warnings this week, with dozens of weather stations in parts of the central and northwestern regions of the country recording temperatures exceeding 40°C. Extreme events

Taiwan braced for the impact of Typhoon Gaemi on Wednesday, with factories and financial markets closed amid forecasts of torrential rain. Scientists say climate change is making typhoons – tropical cyclones that gain energy by feeding on ocean heat – more intense, capable of reaching higher wind speeds and dumping more rain. Japan also suffers from record heat throughout the month of July. Heatstroke warnings were issued in 39 of the country's 47 prefectures on Monday, with temperatures exceeding 37°C. More than 40 million Americans were facing dangerous temperatures on Tuesday, mostly in the western United States, where gusty winds and dry conditions have fueled dozens of wildfires. Even the Arctic is experiencing a heat wave.

""We are registering drops in our sugar production due to some difficulties caused by the bad weather recorded in recent years in the country"", Pascoal Macule, director of Tongaat Hulett, the group that owns the Mafambisse Sugar Company, told journalists on Thursday. The executive said that, of the 75 thousand tons produced annually by the firm, it fell to 40 thousand in the last two years, creating huge losses for the factory. Another factor that influenced the sharp drop in production was the loss of around 8,000 hectares of sugar cane, the raw material for sugar production, due to the effects of climate change: ""This in Nhamatanda, due to the drought in our fields and to the El Niño phenomenon."" Located in the administrative post of Mafambisse, in the district of Dondo, in Sofala, the sugar factory has an installed capacity to produce 92 thousand tons of sugar per year. Mozambique is considered one of the countries most severely affected by climate change in the world, cyclically facing floods and tropical cyclones during the rainy season, which takes place between October and April. The 2018/2019 rainy season was one of the most severe in memory: 714 people died, including 648 victims of cyclones Idai and Kenneth, two of the biggest ever to hit the country. The province of Sofala, in the centre of the country, has been one of the worst hit by storms. In the first quarter of last year, heavy rains and the passage of Cyclone Freddy caused 306 deaths, affected more than 1.3 million people in the country, destroyed 236,000 homes and 3,200 classrooms, according to official government figures. Tongaat Hulett recently announced an injection of 500 million rand (25 million euros) into the Mafambisse and Xinavane sugar mills, both in Mozambique and in which the South African group is the majority shareholder. The challenges the two sugar mills have faced in recent times include countering a continuing decline in sugar sales and obtaining support to prevent low-priced sugar imports from entering the domestic market and affecting domestic production. To turn the situation around, according to the director of Tongaat Hulett, Mafambisse Sugar Mill adopted several strategies, including seeking more financial partners to leverage the company.

For more than two years, Ukrainian forces have been waiting for these reinforcements. But this is “insufficient”, warned President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukraine has received its first Western F-16 fighter jets, expected for more than two years, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced today, showing them to journalists and emphasizing that their number is “insufficient”. “We held hundreds of meetings and negotiations” with allies to obtain these planes and reinforce the country’s air defense and “we often heard the words ‘it is impossible’ in response,” said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during a ceremony at a secret location in Ukraine, according to AFP. “Now it is reality, reality in our heaven. The F-16s are in Ukraine,” he said. Since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Kiev has been begging for the delivery of F-16s in hopes of ending Russian dominance in the air and better protecting its cities and military against incessant bombardment by Moscow's forces. Made in the United States, the planes are considered the crown jewel in the extensive list of military equipment that Ukraine has requested from its allies in an attempt to repel the advance of Russian forces on its soil. The president of Ukraine did not reveal the number of aircraft received by Kiev, limiting himself to saying that it is “insufficient”, as well as the number of Ukrainian pilots trained in the West to fly those aircraft. The delivery date and the country that supplied this first batch were also not revealed. “What is positive is that we expect more F-16s” and that “many of our men are being trained”, assured Zelenskyy. AFP journalists saw at least two F-16s flying over the site during the ceremony. Behind Volodymyr Zelenskyy, two other gray F-16-like aircraft were placed on the ground, partially covered by camouflage netting and with their tails emblazoned with the national coat of arms, the trident.

The climate justice discourse is yet another nonsense in the debate led by groups on the watermelon left: green on the outside, red on the inside. The combination of the two ideas, justice and climate, is abhorrent. Opinions or policies with this level of absurdity must be denounced and rejected! Justice is a social concept. There is no justice without human beings in society. Climate, in turn, corresponds to a set of atmospheric conditions in a region over many years. And most importantly, climate does not depend on humans. Climate depends mainly on the Sun. Without the Sun, there would be no climate, no life on Earth, no human beings – watermelons or not. The watermelon left replaces family with climate in the formulation of national and global policies. In the name of climate justice, draconian environmental measures are taken. They drive industry out of Europe and make fuel prices unsustainable. Our tax burden on diesel is 44% and gasoline is 51%. We all know the consequences. More expensive transport and products. Fewer job opportunities. Fewer jobs. Less justice. And with everything getting more expensive, we still have to pay for a poorly designed energy transition. We are forced to bear environmental costs ignored by countries like China, which has almost 200 times more emissions than we do.

Donald Trump's entry into the US presidency could confuse everything and leave Europe vulnerable

“If anyone thinks this is just about Ukraine, they are sadly mistaken.” The warning was made by the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The Ukrainian president's objective is not new: the idea is to continue putting pressure on the West, namely the United States, for continued financial and military support for Kiev, at a time when Congress remains deadlocked in approving more aid. And if the situation is complicated with Joe Biden's administration, behind the scenes there are fears that a possible election of Donald Trump will only make everything worse. The former president and likely Republican Party candidate has said several times that he wants to leave NATO and stop helping Western allies militarily. If this extends to Ukraine, Kiev will hardly be able to resist Moscow's advances, and it is possible that, one year at a time, it will fall. This scenario leaves several European countries alarmed, and many of them afraid of not being able to resist a possible Russian move beyond Ukraine, especially if the United States is not available to provide support. “We always thought there was a threat like this,” said Major General Veiko-Vello Pal, commander of the Estonian army, speaking to The New York Times about a possible Russian invasion. But the problem is not just the possible lack of American aid. The official from Estonia, one of the countries of the former Soviet Union, which borders modern-day Russia, was merely echoing what the country has been saying for a long time. Because of its geographical location, Estonia is one of the most vulnerable countries. For this reason, it is also one of the countries that has contributed the most to NATO, having one of the largest armies in terms of size, but it will never be enough to defend the country from a power like Russia. The problem is, according to Veiko-Vello Pal, that many other countries do not have this capacity either. “In recent times, we have made it very, very clear that, as a military alliance, many NATO countries are not ready to conduct large-scale operations,” he said. “Simply speaking, many NATO armies are not ready to fight Russia,” he concluded, admitting great discomfort with the situation.",0,"['URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

601,PT_156.txt,"Southeast Europe records unusually hot summer: Greece records hottest July ever

July 2024 went down in history as the hottest month ever recorded in Greece, according to preliminary data analyzed by the scientific team at meteo.gr and the National Observatory of Athens. This heat record not only exceeded the average July temperatures from the period 1991-2020 by 2.9°C, but also exceeded the previous record from July 2012 by 0.3°C. July 2024: a month of historic records in Greece and the world

Analysis of climate data revealed that July 2024 was marked by long periods of exceptionally high temperatures, significantly exceeding seasonal normals across the country. This pattern of extreme heat is in line with a worrying trend observed in recent decades: since 1960, the average July temperature in Greece has increased by 2.5°C. Furthermore, over the past four years, three of the four hottest Julys in the last 80 years have been recorded in Greece, highlighting a growing trend of extreme temperatures attributed to climate change. Additionally, the persistent heat of July 2024 was compounded by one of the longest heat wave periods since 1980. This heat wave occurred between July 8 and 23. But anyone who thinks that this trend was limited only to Greece is mistaken. In fact, globally, July 21, 2024 was considered the hottest day ever, with a global average temperature of 17.1°C, as reported by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service. This record was surpassed again the following day, July 22, with the global average temperature reaching 17.2 °C. Adaptation and mitigation measures: Greece's response to extreme heat

One cannot, in fact, neglect the inherent concerns. Greek authorities have been taking measures to adapt and mitigate the impacts of extreme temperatures. During heat peaks, several cities opened air-conditioned centers to help the vulnerable population. Additionally, there has been an increase in preparedness and response to wildfires, which are a greater threat during periods of extreme heat. Note, for example, the concern that civil protection elements have had, closing the most visited monument in Greece, the Acropolis, in Athens, during the heat, between 12pm and 5pm. Data from July 2024 reinforces the urgency of concrete measures to adapt to climate change. The record temperatures, not just in Greece but globally, are a clear sign of the intensification of extreme weather phenomena, which have expanded into the month of August. Note, in fact, the days with very high temperatures that continue at the beginning of this month across Europe and in Greece, in particular, and that will last for at least the next few weeks.",0,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Traditional Communities Fighting for Climate Justice call has been open since Monday (27) and interested parties may submit projects until January 31, 2024. Applications must be submitted on the organization's website. Proposals may involve topics such as land rights, productive alternatives, training activities, among others. Traditional communities will be considered to be culturally distinct groups, which are characterized by their own forms of social organization and which relate to their territories and natural resources as a fundamental condition for their cultural, social, economic and spiritual reproduction. This includes indigenous people, andirobeiras, everlasting plant gatherers, caatingueiros, mangaba gatherers, quilombolas, extractivists, riverside dwellers, caiçaras, gypsies, terreiro peoples, cipozeiros, chestnut tree growers, faxinalenses, fundo and fecha de pasto, geraizeiros, islhéus, isqueiros, morroquianos, pantaneiros, artisanal fishermen, piassava growers, pomerans, babassu coconut breakers, retireros, rubber tappers, vazanteiros and veredeiros. The Fund indicates that these communities have been greatly affected by the advance of the exploitation of biomes observed in Brazil in recent years, with the growth of illegal occupations and agrarian conflicts. Furthermore, it notes that they are also impacted due to their vulnerability to the consequences of climate change, such as drought or excessive rainfall depending on the region and time of year.

From 2015 to 2017, the water crisis in Espírito Santo required tough measures, such as the prohibition of irrigation of plantations during the day in municipalities in critical situations, with economic impacts on the agricultural sector. Industries also committed to reducing consumption. The population had to commit to a culture of rationing. The state government then began a program to build multipurpose dams. The Reis Magos supply system, in Serra, was also inaugurated in 2017, in this context, reducing the overload on the Santa Maria da Vitória System. And, in 2018, the construction of the Jucu River dam between Domingos Martins and Viana was announced, with the capacity to store 23 billion liters of water: accumulating the resource in the wet season for use in the dry season, as the little ant teaches in the fable. This important project, which is progressing slowly, is included in the PAC. Its urgency is undeniable. In this atypical month of November, with no rain, in which Espírito Santo is one of the states affected by the heat wave, the alert for a new water supply crisis is sounding. In the Metropolitan Area, the Jucu and Santa Maria rivers are approaching the critical level, as reported by Leonel Ximenes in his column. Cesan also reported that the rivers from which the company draws water to supply the population have had their water levels reduced due to the recent drought and warned that the situation affects the 53 municipalities served by the company. In Pinheiros, in the north of the state, the water supply has been compromised in the district of São João Sobrado for 15 days, requiring the use of tanker trucks. Neighborhoods in Marataízes, on the South Coast, have also been suffering from a lack of water since last week. As previously stated, this is still only a warning, which already requires the government to prepare contingency actions. No government has the ability to control when it rains or shines, but experience in previous critical scenarios should teach what needs to be done to avoid or face future supply crises. Without standing idly by. Periods of drought, like those of rain, are cyclical and unpredictable, but will become increasingly common with climate change. Governor Renato Casagrande chairs the Consórcio Brasil Verde, created in 2021 to develop coordinated actions between federative entities, obtaining external financial resources and seeking good practices to mitigate climate effects in the country. Investments are needed not only in large-scale projects, but also in smaller rainwater harvesting projects, as well as industrial water reuse projects and the conservation and recovery of riparian forests, which are responsible for the health of rivers.

Brazil is an environmental powerhouse. Period. It is large, has a voice, has the largest tropical forest on the planet, and has an efficient diplomacy that has already found several solutions to real problems. This year, the country returns to the table at COP28, after four tragic years of denialism, with data on emissions and deforestation reductions. Brazil at COP28: Lula and Marina with ideas and solutions

Environment and health: Approval of the 'Poison Bill' goes against new trends and happens at the worst time

I spoke this morning with Minister Marina Silva, who is already in Dubai for the conference, and she told me that Brazil will present the new financing mechanism for forest countries tomorrow. This is a new path, in addition to those that already exist and that could prosper in the negotiations over the next few days, such as the 91.4 billion euros per year for mitigation and adaptation, which, in COP jargon, means that rich countries with older industrialization will finance policies to reduce the impacts of climate change and also to adapt to irreversible changes in developing nations. There is another path, which is the agreement on losses and damages. Speaking from there today, the minister stated that the agreement is being reached to make compensation for vulnerable countries concrete. COP28: Research shows that workers would like to contribute to sustainability, but are unaware of company strategies

The problem is that here in Brazil, Congress gives a signal that is completely contrary to the agenda presented by Brazil at COP28. By approving a coal subsidy, what Congress is doing is subverting the meaning of the green agenda, corrupting the meaning of the wind energy law to serve the lobbies and transferring the cost of this contradiction to you, reader. Subsidizing coal also means sending this cost, estimated at R$4.6 billion per year, to the electricity bill. There is also a contradiction in Dubai, of course. There is an expectation of progress on the climate change agenda at COP28 despite it being held in the United Arab Emirates, the heart of oil, which is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, therefore a large part of the problem. Minister Marina Silva told me that the big victory would be to leave the conference with a commitment to reducing the use of fossil fuels, which will be challenging as the president of COP28, Sultan al-Jaber, also heads the local oil company. Contradictions: On his way to the COP, Lula goes to the birthplace of oil and tyranny in the Middle East

At this meeting, it is expected that the first assessment will be made of the commitments, national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions established in the Paris Agreement. But it will be in Brazil, at COP30, ten years after the agreement signed in the French capital, that the great adjustment and the reestablishment of goals will be made. Now, one detail: at COP28, everyone is looking towards COP30 in Belém. But where will COP29 be? There is a stalemate.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said this Friday, the 1st, that world economies need to address the debate on fossil fuels and reduce their use. The president's speech was given at COP 28, in the United Arab Emirates, one day after Brazil received an invitation from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Allies (OPEC+) to join the group. “The world is already convinced of the potential of renewable energy. It is time to address the debate on the slow pace of decarbonization of the planet and work towards an economy less dependent on fossil fuels,” he said. In his opening speech, Lula drew attention to the increase in global temperatures and extreme global events, such as the historic drought in the Amazon and cyclones in the southern region of Brazil. “The bill has come early,” said the president, stating that the planet is “fed up” with climate agreements that are made and not fulfilled, and reiterated that Brazil is willing to lead “by example.” The day before, Brazil received an invitation to join OPEC+, the organization that controls oil prices through a cartel of major producers such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela and other allied countries, such as Mexico and Russia. The organization, which uses the increase in fuel production to control the value of the commodity on the international market, has a different view from that defended by Lula in his speech at the COP, which is that fossil fuels should continue to be used. This Friday, Petrobras CEO Jean Paul Prates told Reuters that Brazil should join the OPEC+ group of oil producers. According to him, the country should play a cooperative role and monitor decisions, but without participating in the production quota system. “They call on other countries that do not have the right to vote and are not subject to quotas. We would never participate in an entity that established a quota for Brazil, especially with the support of Petrobras, which is a publicly traded company and cannot have a quota,” the executive stated. In addition to defending the use of renewable energy and the obvious awkward situation that the country is putting itself in by accepting to join OPEC+, Lula said in his speech that spending on weapons and wars should be used to combat hunger and climate change. “How many tons of carbon are emitted by missiles that cross the sky and fall on innocent civilians, especially children and women?” The president also said that “the world has naturalized unacceptable disparities in income, gender and race and that it is not possible to tackle climate change without tackling inequality.” In his speech, Lula also criticized the UN’s stance on its inability to maintain peace, “simply because some of its members profit from war.” The United Nations has Russia, Ukraine and Israel as member countries, for example. “Governments cannot be exempted from their responsibilities. No country will solve its problems alone. We are all obliged to act together, beyond our borders. Brazil is willing to lead by example. We have adjusted our goals, which are now more ambitious than those of many developed countries,” he said.",0,"['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities']",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
606,PT_157.txt,"United Kingdom: The country has been invaded by a new species of jumping spider! Scientists have recently discovered a new species of spider in the south of England. It is believed that its migration has been facilitated by climate change. Researchers assure that this species is not poisonous to humans. However, it is attracting a lot of attention. But what is happening? Several cities in the United States have recently been on alert for invasions of giant exotic spiders. It is enough to send people into panic. Now it is the turn of Europe, more specifically, the southern regions of the United Kingdom. During a biological census carried out by the British Arachnological Society in Penryn, west Cornwall (England), in 2023, researchers identified for the first time a species of spider native to the Caribbean. Far from the giant exotic spider invading the United States, this species is tiny, measuring no more than 3 to 4 mm in length. Scientifically called Anasaitis milesae, this species of jumping spider is completely harmless. Like most spiders, this one is not poisonous, but like all animals, it defends itself by biting when it feels threatened. Given its size, its bite seems insignificant. But how did it get from the Caribbean to England? According to scientists, it traveled thanks to international trade. Due to its tiny size, it could easily fit into suitcases or be transported in international shipping containers. And it clearly enjoyed the Anglo-Saxon climate. It is not the only animal and insect to travel this way; the Asian hornet was also introduced this way. As a result of climate change, insect invasions are becoming more frequent. The milder climate of the UK's port areas is favouring the establishment of these new specimens. Anasaitis milesae is not the only species to have recently arrived in the European country. Experts have also observed a Mediterranean spider called Zoropsis spinimana, or 'false wolf spider', in London. Another species identified in the south of the UK is Segestria florentina. This spider has the distinctive feature of having green fangs. Unlike the Caribbean species, these two species are imposing in size and have a painful bite.

The debate between the eight party leaders with parliamentary seats had started four minutes ago when it was interrupted by a young man from the Climáximo activist movement. “The fight against climate change is not on the voting table, it is in the hands of the people”, shouted the protester, who invaded the studio that RTP set up at the Nova SBE university, in Carcavelos, and placed himself in front of the moderator, the journalist Carlos Daniel. The young man was immediately removed by a member of the production, at the moment when Pedro Nuno Santos, leader of the PS, was explaining the scenarios he defends for governance for the country after the legislative elections on March 10th. Shortly afterwards, when the president of the PSD, Luís Montenegro, was being questioned, more background voices from protesters were heard due to the atmosphere, which led Carlos Daniel to mention that some protests were continuing “by some people who understood that this was the moment to bring your message to the public space.” “It is no longer new in the country, but we will keep the debate within what was planned”, he added. Climáximo protesters also painted the windows behind the candidates with red paint. In a statement seen by Observador, the group states that the protest “aimed to interrupt the normality of electoral debates that ignore the climate crisis and whose plans” lead “to climate collapse: water shortages for people, losses in agriculture and food production, deaths due to unbearable heat waves, displacements due to deadly fires”. António Assunção, spokesperson for Climáximo, says that “in these elections, not only is stopping the climate crisis not the main issue, but no party — with or without parliamentary seats — presents a plan compatible with the limits of nature”. “Failing to implement” cuts of “at least” 75% of emissions by 2030 is “guaranteeing climate and civilizational collapse”, he considers. “We cannot allow them to continue taking us to climate hell. All parties deliberately reiterate their declaration of war against people. Society must resist and fight to stop the climate crisis”, adds the spokesperson, who reiterates that the group believes that an “alternative” to stop the climate crisis is “on the streets, not at the ballot box”. In the statement released this Friday, Climáximo recalls that over the last week it has been altering the billboards of several parties, placing the phrase “with your vote we guarantee climate collapse”.

1. The rector of the University of Coimbra thinks he can fire the director of the Center for Russian Studies at that University with the same arbitrariness with which any boss of a stairwell company fires a young man on a trial period. There is no disciplinary process, there are no facts to justify it. There is the fact that the fired director is Russian and there is the accusation made by two Ukrainians that the director recommends books by Russian authors and has an opinion on the war in Ukraine that does not coincide with that of the informants. In all the news that came out about this dismissal, which was carried out outside any legal process, which is serious in a public institution, there are no other facts that justify it other than the nationality of the author and the statement regarding his opinions. . It is clear that we are facing a gross violation of article 13 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, according to which no one can be harmed or deprived of any right due to their language, territory of origin, religion, political or ideological convictions. That Ukrainian whistleblowers ignore the Portuguese Constitution and the democratic rights it enshrines does not surprise me, but that the rector of a University should promote the summary dismissal of a professor based on his nationality and for a crime of opinion, is something that bothers me. It amazes me, it outrages me, and I consider it to be a disservice to a University whose prestige should be defended. Were we not living in the climate of witch hunt that has been imposed on this western corner of the world and the news of a rector who, in an act of total arrogance, summarily dismisses a professor, violating his fundamental rights with the same degree of carelessness with which he prohibits beef in canteens would be the cause of a national and international scandal. 2.

In June, Zelenskyy had already described the failure of the operation. “I spoke with the commander-in-chief about the general situation. “A very significant result is that the Russian army failed in its operation in Kharkiv. Now we are holding them back as much as possible and destroying Russian units that enter our territory and terrorize the Kharkiv region,” the Ukrainian president said. Russia, however, has already denied giving up the territory, according to The Moscow Times. “This operation is ongoing and will continue until it is successfully completed,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on July 17. In a July 24 update, Ukrainian forces near the city described the fighting as “tense and difficult.” Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, was overrun by some 30,000 Russian troops, who entered several villages and reopened the northeastern front of the war. The city lacked the necessary defenses that should have been in place by now, experts and commanders in the war that has dragged on since 2022 said.",0,['URW: Praise of Russia'],['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
