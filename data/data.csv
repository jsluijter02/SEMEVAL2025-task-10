 VLADIMIR Putin has honoured an army unit accused of war crimes and genocide in the Russian town of Bucha, reports suggest.

A decree signed by the Russian tyrant gave the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade the title of guards – scandalously praising them for ""mass heroism and valour, tenacity and courage.""

Earlier this month, the Ukrainian ministry identified the unit as those responsible for the alleged rape and murder of innocent Ukrainians.

The barbarous pack, headed by Lieutenant Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - dubbed the “Butcher of Bucha” - left a trail of death and destruction in their wake.

Harrowing pictures from the city, to the north-west of the capital Kyiv, showed the bodies of civilians scattered in the road and in shallow graves — many with bound hands and signs of torture.

Some of them, from the wounds they had suffered, had been shot from close range.

Heavily mutilated corpses of what appeared to be men scattered along the floor of a children's camp as rescue workers carried the innocent victims out in body bags.

A local priest said dogs were seen eating rotting corpses in apocalyptic scenes to grip the commuter town after the troops laid waste to warzones.

Men, women and children were found handcuffed with a bullet in the head and chest as evidence of alleged torture chambers emerged online.

Women and children were also found by Ukrainian soldiers, having been raped and then murdered.

The barbaric troops are believed to have conducted the Bucha slaughter as they scarpered from Kyiv after their botched attempt to take the Ukrainian capital.

Days later, Ukrainian intelligence suggested the troops were being redeployed in Belgorod in Western Russia amid claims that Russian commanders were refusing to rotate their brigades.

The country’s defence ministry claimed troops were being sent to the ""hottest spots"" in the hope they will be slaughtered by Ukrainian fighters before they can testify before a war crime tribunal.

The Kremlin has continued to deny accusations its troops committed war crimes in Ukraine after suggesting chilling pictures of dead bodies strewn across Kyiv streets were staged by Ukraine and the West.

Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky was visibly emotional as he visited the site just days after the mass graves were discovered.

The Ukrainian leader was flanked by security as he vowed to ensure that the “war crimes” committed by Russian soldiers on his country’s soil were “the last such evil on Earth”.

Boris Johnson later described the events as not “far short of genocide” as the EU's Ursula von der Leyen was later seen visiting the scene of the massacre.

It comes as the number of heads of state and former prime ministers backing calls for an international tribunal over Ukraine continues to rise amid widespread international condemnation of the events unfolding in Eastern Europe.

1,EN_UA_023211.txt,"Europe Putin thanks US journalist Tucker Carlson for interview 

 Former Fox News star Carlson released a two-hour interview with Putin in Moscow last Thursday, just ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia's offensive in Ukraine.

ussian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said he was grateful to controversial right-wing US talk show host Tucker Carlson for his interview last week and ""intermediary"" role with the West.

Former Fox News star Carlson released a two-hour interview with Putin in Moscow last Thursday, just ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia's offensive in Ukraine.

In it, the Russian president said the West needed to understand that it was ""impossible"" for Russia to be defeated in Ukraine.

""Since we are not able to have direct dialogue (with the West) today... we have to be grateful to Mr Carlson to be able to do it by his intermediary"" role, Putin told journalists in quotes distributed by the Kremlin.

Even so, Putin said he was ""not totally satisfied"" with the interview, the first he has given to a Western journalist since launching his offensive in Ukraine.

It has been seen more than 200 million times on X, formerly Twitter.

Putin's disappointment, though, seemed to stem from his hopes for a more bellicose exchange, saying that he expected Carlson to be more ""aggressive"" and was waiting for ""difficult questions"".

""I was not only ready for that but I was hoping for it because that would have allowed me to reply in the same manner,"" Putin said.

Carlson came in for criticism from Western media for the lack of tough questions in the interview, in which Putin lectured him on his views of Russian history, portraying the country as a victim of Western betrayals.

Putin acknowledged that Carlson had ""tried to interrupt me several times"" but praised the conservative journalist, who is close to former US president Donald Trump, for his ""patience"".

The Russian leader did complain, though, that his quotes were ""deformed"" in Western media.

2,EN_UA_011260.txt,"Russia has a clear plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine 

 The conflict in Ukraine may end either by diplomatic or military means. However, it can be possible only after Moscow achieves its goals.

""An opportunity to resolve the conflict will appear only when Ukraine ceases to pose a threat to Russia and discriminate against Russian-speaking Ukrainians,” Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's Ambassador to the UN Security Council, said at a briefing at the UN Security Council.

""If this result can be achieved through negotiations, we are ready for such a scenario. If not, then our objectives will be achieved by military means,"" he added.

Russia is not fighting against the Ukrainian people. Russia is fighting against the criminal nationalist regime that came to power in 2014” after the coup in Kyiv, the diplomat said.

""The new Ukrainian leadership is trying to purge the country of everything connected with Russia and glorify Nazi accomplices. <…>

""The Kyiv regime and its most rabid patrons have forgotten the meaning of the word ""peace."" It is no coincidence that the European Union finances arms supplies to Kyiv through the European Peace Fund, without even thinking about how blasphemous it sounds and looks. <…>

""Ukraine, in fact, has become a NATO PMC. It gets money, weapons and intelligence data. Ukraine receives instructions which targets to attack and where. It is the Ukrainian people who suffer from this in the first place and the people of Ukraine are forced to fight for the sake of someone else's tasks.""

However, the Russian Ambassador to the UN said, everything could have ended differently for Ukraine, if Kyiv had implemented the now-defunct Minsk Agreements that were signed in 2014 and 2015 ""in an attempt to pave the way for peace by granting the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics a special status as part of the Ukrainian state"".

Former Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and ex-president of France Francois Hollande later confirmed that neither sitting President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, nor his predecessors, nor France and Germany, who were involved in the Minks Agreements process, never intended to fulfil them. This diplomatic process served only as a ""smoke screen"" behind which they secretly armed Ukraine against Russia.

Merkel's and Hollande's confessions caused an uproar in Moscow. Russian officials called them a formalisation of betrayal. Interestingly, though, no one in the West was embarrassed about those statements. It appears that the West continues implementing its strategy.

In December, Ukraine put forward the idea of the Global Peace Summit based on Zelensky's ""peace formula."" In that formula, among other things, Zelensky demanded Russia should withdraw its troops from all Ukrainian territories.

Moscow dismissed the plan as it ignored the new status of Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, Kherson, Zaporozhye (Zaporizhzhia) regions and Crimea as part of Russia.

Now Kyiv has a new ""idea"":

The Ukrainian administration wants to hold a ""peace summit"" at UN headquarters in New York on February 24 (one year anniversary since the start of the special operation), but without Moscow's participation.

According to The Associated Press, Ukrainian President Zelenskiy was planning to visit New York in February to address a high-level meeting of the 193-member General Assembly on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine would like the UN General Assembly to adopt two resolutions:

""Peace talks could start after the UN General Assembly passes the resolutions or after the proposed summit is held,"" Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova said.

3,EN_UA_101067.txt,"First war of TikTok era sees tragedy, humor and deceit 

 eart-rending videos of artillery strikes are being served up alongside funny snippets such as bomb-shelter cooking tips and invasion misinformation as the war in Ukraine plays out on TikTok.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, millions of people have tuned into the hugely popular social networking service for news and views of what is happening on the battleground.

That was not lost on United States officials who hosted a video call to brief popular TikTok ""influencers"" on details about the war, according to posts at the social network.

""Lots of people have been turning to digital creators to learn about the invasion of Ukraine,"" read a tweet Friday by Gen-Z for Change, a nonprofit focused on using social media to promote civil discourse.

""Yesterday, we joined the @WhiteHouse and @WHNSC for a briefing on the United States' strategic goals in Ukraine so we're better able to debunk misinformation,"" it added, referring to the White House National Security Council.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, music-themed video clips in Marta Vasyuta's account gave way to images of soldiers and the ravages of war.

Stuck in London, the 20-year-old Ukrainian exchange student uses TikTok to share glimpses of the tragedy inflicted on people still in her home country.

""My mission is to spread information, to not stop talking about that, because it really matters,"" said the economics student from Lviv, whose videos have logged millions of views.

Valeria Shashenok stayed in the city of Cherniguiv, northeast of Kyiv, and switched to English to broaden the reach of her sometimes surreal wartime TikTok posts.

In one, she shows how to cook borscht in a bomb shelter. In another, she walks through rubble to a Rihanna music remix.

The 20-year-old photographer is among those who have not given up on the playful nature of videos considered a trademark of TikTok, which boasts more than 1 billion users.

""I try to keep the humor, because it is my nature,"" said 23-year-old TikTok creator Rimma, who asked for her second name to be withheld.

""I'm living through this trauma. My life is ruined, and there is nothing left for me but irony.""

Her TikTok clips include one of her in a basement in Odessa, quipping that Ukrainians' idea of going for a walk now is a jaunt to the nearest shelter.

She said the line between what was funny and what was hurtful was no longer clear, given the suffering and fear afflicting so many.

But the appetite for wartime content at TikTok appears strong, with Vasyuta and Shashenok seeing their accounts’ subscriber ranks multiply.

Youthful sass

While breaking news events such as armed conflicts have featured on social media for years, TikTok tends to feature spontaneity and a bit of sass that has proven particularly popular with younger audiences.

In the US where members of Gen Z, born in the late 1990s, shun traditional television, online platforms like TikTok are prime sources of news.

""I hope that the kids who watch this war unfold on TikTok become opposed to war [and] realize the horrors and dangers of it,"" said US high school history teacher Chris Dier, who is also a TikTok creator.

""What I don't want is for it to desensitize them and normalize war.""

Young TikTok users were also being ""bombarded"" with propaganda that they likely needed help navigating, said Dier.

TikTok told AFP that it had ramped up resources to detect and counter ""emerging threats"" and ""harmful disinformation"" on the platform.

On March 6, the subsidiary of China-based ByteDance suspended the uploading of videos in Russia in reaction to a new law making it a crime to ""discredit"" the Russian military.

The flow of pro-Russian messages has noticeably declined at TikTok, with the most popular account being state-backed news agency RIA Novosti, which is known for false or discredited claims, such as the alleged existence of secret bioweapons labs in Ukraine.

4,EN_UA_102963.txt,"Ukraine's President Zelenskyy to address Mexico's Congress to gain support in ongoing conflict with Russia, say sources 

 Mexico City: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will address Mexico’s Congress by video on Thursday in an effort to gain support for his nation’s ongoing conflict with Russia, according to two persons with knowledge of the situation.

The leftist president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has come under fire from certain Ukrainian sympathisers for his opposition to European arm supplies to Kyiv. The Mexican administration has stated its desire to maintain neutrality in the crisis.

Nevertheless, Mexico has cast a vote on a number of significant UN resolutions with the United States and other Western nations.

According to the sources, the address was scheduled to start Thursday at about noon.

Zelenskyy’s address to the lower house of Congress came at the invitation of a congressional friendship group between Mexico and Ukraine, according to the sources. There are other similar groups in the Mexican Congress, including one for Russia.

The Ukrainian embassy in Mexico did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The German president and the US ambassador to Mexico have been among the diplomatic allies that have sought to persuade the Mexican government to side with Ukraine against Russia.

Attempts to sway public opinion in Mexico over the war in Ukraine have led to some notable spats in Congress.

Last year, the Russian ambassador to Mexico told Mexican lawmakers that Mexico would never take orders from “Uncle Sam”, prompting the US ambassador to urge Mexico to support Ukraine.

Lopez Obrador last year proposed a plan to halt the fighting in Ukraine, although Ukrainian officials opposed it, arguing it would be advantageous to Russia.

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard met separately with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts to discuss the peace plan at the UN General Assembly in September. Nothing has come of the plan so far.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is currently on a Latin American tour, visiting Brazil, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.

5,EN_UA_022319.txt,"Shapps Says UK Facing ‘Pre-War World’ and Can’t Risk Cutting Defence Spending 

 Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has said Britain is in a “pre-war world” and cannot afford to reduce spending on the military.

In a major speech at Lancaster House in London, Mr. Shapps said the “peace dividend” that followed the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s was over.

Mr. Shapps said: “Because the era of the peace dividend is over, in five years’ time we could be looking at multiple theatres including Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.”

“Ask yourself, looking at today’s conflicts across the world, is it more likely that that number grows or reduces? I suspect we all know the answer. It’s likely to grow,” he added.

Mr. Shapps also announced 20,000 British service personnel would take part in NATO’s largest military exercises since the Cold War, following the announcement last week of a £2.5 billion support package to Ukraine.

Over the weekend the RAF carried out air strikes with U.S. forces on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, after they targeted merchant shipping in their campaign against Israel.

The British government has set a goal of increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP, but Mr. Shapps has argued it should rise to 3 percent.

His speech on Monday—in front of an audience including top brass in the British military—might be seen as pushing the argument for increased defence spending.

Mr. Shapps said, “We made the critical decision to set out our aspiration to reach 2.5 percent of GDP on defence, and as we stabilise and grow this economy we’ll continue to strive to reach that as soon as possible.”

“But now is the time for all allied and democratic nations across the world to do the same thing and ensure their defence spending is growing too,” he added.

‘The Tanks Are Literally on Europe’s Ukrainian Lawn’The defence secretary said: “An age of idealism has been replaced by a period of hard-headed realism. Today our adversaries are busy rebuilding their barriers, old enemies are reanimated, new foes are taking shape, battle lines are being redrawn.”

“The tanks are literally on Europe’s Ukrainian lawn and the foundations of the world order being shaken to their core,” he added.

Mr. Shapps refused to rule out further action against the Houthis following the weekend attacks.

He said the strike against the Houthis was a “single action” but added, “We will now monitor very carefully to see what they do next, how they respond and we will see from there.”

Later Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would “not hesitate” to protect British shipping in the Red Sea.

Mr. Sunak told Sky News, “As we’ve said, not just to the Houthis but to their Iranian masters, in a sense, because they are really proxies for Tehran, this cannot go on.”

“Freedom of navigation is just a given and always has been for many years. We cannot have that situation where they are trying to harass it, and we will keep a very close eye. If we have to take further action, that is something that we will consider,” he said.

He added, “They should be aware that if it doesn’t stop then of course we will then have to take the decisions that need to be taken.”",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 While the liberal elite continue to lecture ordinary people about carbon emissions, the 4,000 page Omnibus Bill, which is packed with expensive climate change initiatives, is being transported by private jet to Biden’s holiday home in the US Virgin Islands.

“This is the optics of climate politics, especially when the climate envoy John Kerry takes a flight like this. The White House, they’ve used what’s called an auto-pen before, when presidents have been on trips and have to sign something,” said Fox News host Bill Hammer.

 A top Ukrainian official has appealed for calm as he reassured the nation that an invasion from neighboring Russia was not imminent—despite officials acknowledging there is a real threat as NATO allies have ramped up defenses in the Baltic Sea region this week.

Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s Minister of Defense, said on Monday that at this time, “there are no grounds to believe” that Moscow is preparing an invasion very soon and there is no need for citizens “to have [their] bags packed.”

“Don’t worry, sleep well,” he said, adding that “there are risky scenarios. They’re possible and probable in the future,” though at this time “such a threat doesn’t exist.”

On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also told the nation that the situation is “under control,” while Reznikov affirmed Russia had not formed what he called battle groups, “which would have indicated that tomorrow they could launch an offensive.”

Reznikov’s and Zelensky’s statement in a bid to project calm in order not to destabilize the situation and avoid panic comes as another multi-million dollar shipment of U.S. military equipment arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday.

“Our partners are increasing the amount of military assistance. And today we are meeting the third aircraft from the United States government as part of this assistance,” the defense minister said at a press briefing before the aircraft loaded with defensive aid totaling about $200 million landed at an airport in the capital of Ukraine.

Moscow has repeatedly denied intentions to invade Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the West is showing “hysteria” and is putting out information “laced with lies.”

Peskov on Tuesday again accused the U.S. of “fomenting tensions” around Ukraine, a former Soviet state that has been locked in a conflict with Russia for almost eight years.

Western concern over Moscow planning an invasion of its neighbor started after tens of thousands of Russian troops massed near the Russia–Ukraine border. In 2014, Russia used its military forces to annex the Crimean Peninsula, a move that drew sanctions from then-President Barack Obama. The fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a peaceful settlement have stalled.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 s the world faces the critical challenge of climate change, building nurseries has become one of the key ways to mitigate its effects through reforestation and restoration efforts.

In Indonesia, a notable project is the Rumpin Nursery in Bogor, which has emerged as a prominent model of public-private partnership in supporting Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink initiative. Established in 2022, the Rumpin Nursery was inaugurated by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and is the result of a collaboration between the Environment and Forestry Ministry, the Public Works and Housing Ministry, and APRIL Group, a pulp and paper producer.

APRIL Group's nursery system in Pangkalan Kerinci, Riau province, inspired the Rumpin Nursery development, which has the capacity of planting approximately 200 million new seedlings per year. The company continues to invest heavily in research and development to increase plantation fiber productivity.

Over the next three years, the Indonesian government plans to build 30 nursery centers, each with an annual production capacity of 10 to 12 million seedlings, which will result in a combined annual production of 360 million seedlings. These seedlings will be used to rehabilitate and restore degraded lands, to be planted on critical land, areas with high landslide potential and upper reaches of river basins (DAS).

The Rumpin Nursery has successfully grown and planted thousands of native tree species, including Manglid, Sengon, Salam and Sirsak. Since President Jokowi's inauguration last year, the nursery has begun distributing seedlings in a number of locations such as the Ciliwung River. Following the Rumpin Nursery's successful collaboration, the government is currently focusing on developing additional nurseries in other regions, including Danau Toba, Likupang, Mentawir and Bali.

By replicating and scaling up such models, Indonesia can unlock the potential of nurseries and other nature-based solutions to achieve its ambitious climate goals. This public-private partnership has enabled the Rumpin Nursery to align with the Indonesian government's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 31.89 percent unconditionally by 2030, as per the updated NDC.

As part of its efforts to support Indonesia's restoration and forestry goals, the APRIL Group recently earned an appreciation award for its role in the public-private collaboration that established the Rumpin Nursery.

PT Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper, the operating arm of APRIL Group, also received an appreciation award for its work to improve the performance of industrial forest plantations. Both awards were presented by Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya and received by Sihol Aritonang, president director of PT RAPP.

""APRIL is proud that our technology and seed management system can serve as a reference for nursery development in Indonesia. Through the Rumpin Nursery, we show our continuous support for one of the government's activities in achieving FOLU Net Sink 2030,"" said Sihol.

Indonesia's Forestry and Land Use (FOLU) Net Sink is the newest forest policy in Indonesia that identifies the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) absorption targeted to be equal or higher than emissions in the FOLU sector in 2030. The Net Sink FOLU is projected to contribute up to 60 percent of the Net Zero Emission target by 2060 as part of the country's efforts to achieve its climate goals under the Paris Climate Agreement and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

The key targets of Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink 2030 include efforts to ensure reduced deforestation and forest degradation, the importance of sustainable forest management, social forestry and land rehabilitation, biodiversity and ecosystem preservation.

 During the state visit by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, King [Name] honored K-pop sensation Blackpink with honorary MBEs, acknowledging their role as ambassadors for the COP climate change summit and advocates for the UN’s sustainable development goals, BBC reported.

The King praised Blackpink’s commitment to environmental causes, highlighting their ability to address vital issues while being global superstars. The investiture took place in Buckingham Palace’s prestigious 1844 room, underscoring the significance of this diplomatic exchange with South Korea. Blackpink members—Roseanne Park, Jennie Kim, Jisoo Kim, and Lalisa Manoban—are now honorary members of the Order of the British Empire.

Despite the King’s admission of a personal lack of familiarity with “Gangnam Style,” a military band surprised onlookers by playing the song during the changing of the guard. The state visit prioritized both serious diplomacy and pageantry, focusing on enhancing trade links and military partnerships.

 FACT CHECK: Did Greta Thunberg Say Saving The Banks Would Save The World?

A video shared on social media purports climate change activist Greta Thunberg said to save the banks in order to save the world.

Verdict: False

This video is missing context. Thunberg was not advocating for banks to “save the world.”

Fact Check:

Thunberg recently pulled out of an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book festival, BBC reported. The event was sponsored by the company Baillie Gifford and Thunberg refused to appear at the event claiming that Baillie Gifford, “invests heavily in the fossil fuel industry.”

The Facebook post purports Thunberg suggested the way to save the world is to save the banks. The post shared a small clip from an interview with Thunberg in which the audience claps after her alleged statement.

“The money is there if we can save the banks, we can save the world,” she says in the clip. The caption reads, “GRETA – Saying the quiet parts out loud. The only way to save the planet is to save the banks.”

The clip is taken out of context. Check Your Fact conducted a reverse image and found the clip stems from a conference called, ‘The Right to a Future’ held by The Intercept.

The interviewer asks Greta about her rebuttal to governments saying fighting climate change is “too expensive.” The full exchange features Thunberg arguing that world governments have enough money to help curb climate change suggesting if there is “enough money to bail out the banks, then there is enough money to help the environment.” (RELATED: Did RFK Jr. Meet With Then-President Trump To Lead A Vaccine Safety Commission?)

There is no credible news report that suggests she was making this claim or had recently made such a remark.

 Climate change protesters have been arrested in Melbourne, Victoria after they staged another blockade, this time at the busy Flinders Street Station.

Over 30 climate activists refused to move off the road at the intersection of Flinders and Swanston Streets on March 16. This followed a protest of hundreds of activists who marched from Treasury Gardens to Flinders Street Station in the city later in the afternoon.

The activists were heard yelling, “People power, power to the people,” and, “This is civil disobedience in action.”

“Doing it for the kids I love,” and, “Climate crisis,” were among the signs and banners waved by the group of protesters.

“Free Palestine” signs were also seen among the climate emergency signs displayed on Melbourne streets.

Meanwhile, police arrested 32 people who remained on the runway, and 27 of them will be charged on summons with obstruction of the road.

Police had warned rally organisers who wanted to avoid arrest to leave the intersection, The Age reported.

A spokesperson for Victorian Police told The Epoch Times they attended the planned rally and say about 300 people were there.

“A number of protesters remained at the intersection of Flinders and Swanston Streets after being told to move on by police,” the police said. “32 protesters remained on the roadway and were subsequently arrested. 27 of those protesters will be charged on summons with obstruction of a road.

“Five of those protesters needed to be carried from the roadway by police, four will be charged with intentional obstruction of an emergency worker, and summary hinder police, and bailed to Melbourne Magistrates Court. One will be charged on summons with intentional obstruction of an emergency worker and summary hinder police.”

Extinction Rebellion Victoria posted multiple videos showing footage of the event on March 17.

Multiple Protests Throughout the WeekDuring the week, Extinction Rebellion held multiple “disrupt the city” protests in the city.

“We rebel on the unceded lands of the peoples of the Kulin Nation. Always was, always will be,” the group claimed.

Police were forced to move activists to the footpath on March 13 after they allegedly blocked traffic on LaTrobe and Bourke Streets.

“We are non-violent protesters—we would never resort to violence because we creating the world that we want to see.”

However, the Victorian Police said they respect the right to peacefully protest.

Incident Follows Perth Climate ProtestIn late February, a climate change activist was arrested, and multiple others were issued move-on notices, at a protest against a major Woodside gas project.

The activists were seen holding signs including “oil and gas collapse,” “climate action now,” and “Woodside ecocide blood on your hands,” gathered outside the company’s headquarters in Perth.

Police were seen placing handcuffs on an individual on the road in front of the company’s building on Feb. 20.

This rally was timed to coincide with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese travelling to Perth for three days to discuss the economy, cost of living, and housing at a Federal Cabinet meeting.

Commenting on the incident, a police spokesperson confirmed with The Epoch Times that one person had been charged with obstructing the carriageway.

 Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg this week announced his intent to spend $500 million on a campaign to replace coal plants and prevent the construction of new natural gas plants in favor of renewable energy sources.

The Washington Examiner noted that this $500 million, along with the $500 million Bloomberg previously gave to the ""Beyond Carbon"" campaign, make it one of the largest philanthropic efforts involving climate change ever.

""By working with our partners across the country, we hope to transform the way we power America by moving beyond fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy,"" Bloomberg, a United Nations special envoy on climate ambition and solutions, said during the U.N. Global Assembly in New York on Wednesday.

In a press release, the former mayor's organization Bloomberg Philanthropies announced that it has helped to retire more than two-thirds of all the coal plants in the United States. The group is also helping to fund several environmentalist groups in the country, including Sierra Club, Earthjustice, and the League of Conservation Voters.

Chris Jahn, chief executive of the American Chemistry Council, hit out at the announcement in a statement to The New York Times.

""Attempts to shut down American chemical manufacturing are a bet against millions of hard-working men and women in our industry,"" Jahn said, adding that this program ""would send essential jobs overseas and threaten America's leadership to innovate and compete with countries like China.""

 KHARKIV - Russia pounded over 30 villages and towns in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region after launching a ground offensive in the border region, forcing almost 6,000 to evacuate, the governor said on Monday. Ukraine’s General Staff acknowledged on Monday that Russia “currently is achieving tactical success” after driving a wedge into Kyiv’s defences. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday that troops had “improved the tactical position and dealt a blow to (Ukrainian) manpower” around border villages including Lyptsi and the town of Vovchansk.

“They are shelling the villages, firing on everything they can,” Sergiy Kryvetchenko, deputy head of the military administration in the village of Lyptsi, told AFP. “The KABs (guided aerial bombs) are flying. The artillery is flying. Drones. Everything,” he said.On Friday, Russia began an offensive across its border into the Kharkiv region and later claimed to have taken several villages in the region near the border.

The situation in the Kharkiv region is “complex and dynamically changing”, with Russian troops mounting assaults in various areas, Ukraine’s General Staff said. Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov wrote on social media that over the last day, “more than 30” towns and villages “were struck by enemy artillery and mortar attacks”, wounding at least nine people.

Some areas were also bombed by Russian aircraft, Synegubov added. A total of 5,762 people have been evacuated from their homes since the start of the offensive, the governor said. Over the course of Sunday, Russia “carried out 22 assaults” in five border areas, 14 of which were still ongoing, the General Staff said. The General Staff said fighting was ongoing for the border town of Vovchansk, where Russia was deploying “significant forces”.

numbering up to five battalions.

Vovchansk, which previously had a population of 2,500 but now has only 200-300 residents, suffered “massive shelling” on Sunday that hit houses and wounded seven, said Synegubov.

A 69-year-old man was also wounded in the town of Izyum by detonating ammunition and a woman was injured in a village near the town of Kupiansk.

The city of Kharkiv itself had not been struck over the last 24 hours, however, he said.

Synegubov said on national television that “the grey zone and the front line are expanding” because Russia is “trying to deliberately stretch it, attacking in small groups in new directions”.

The DeepState Telegram channel, which is close to the Ukrainian army, wrote that Russia had taken pockets of territory measuring around 100 square kilometres (39 square miles).

Russia “continues to advance to Vovchansk”, the channel said.

“They are gaining foothold on the outskirts for further entry into the town.”

Russia was also advancing towards the border village of Lyptsi and attempting to enter the nearby village of Glyboke, it said.

Ukraine was mounting “constant fire”, including from drones, “but unfortunately it does not stop them”.

The Russian defence ministry said troops had repelled Ukrainian counterattacks near Glyboke.

Rybar, a Russian Telegram channel with military links, said Moscow’s offensive led to territorial gains because troops took some villages where Russian soldiers already had a presence and others that were “deserted wastelands”.

As of Monday morning, there were no “large-scale breakthroughs of the enemy’s defences”, Rybar said.

14,EN_UA_026142.txt,"Oppose imperialist War! SEP/IYSSE public meeting in Sri Lanka 

 The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) and the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) in Sri Lanka are holding an online meeting entitled “Oppose imperialist war!” on Thursday, May 23, at 7pm.

In announcing the recent International May Day Rally, David North, chairman of the International Editorial Board of the World Socialist Web Site, warned, “A third world war is not a distant possibility. The opening stages of this war are already underway.”

Israel’s genocide in Gaza against Palestinians and its US-backed attacks against Iran are just one front in a rapidly emerging world war involving nuclear armed powers. US imperialism and its allies are already engaged in a war against Russia in Ukraine and are making advanced preparations for a catastrophic conflict with China.

The imperialist leaders as well as various media pundits now casually refer to a nuclear war as an acceptable strategic option, despite the grave threat it poses to the existence of humanity.

The Biden administration, along with other NATO powers, have repeatedly crossed the “red lines” in Ukraine which they previously accepted as necessary to prevent nuclear war.

One might consider that the imperialist leaders—Biden, Sunak, Macron and Scholz—are criminally insane as they drag the planet towards nuclear conflagration. However, their policies are not simply the product of deranged individuals but of the profound crisis of world capitalism for which they have no rational, progressive solution and see a global war for domination as the only way out.

War is being accompanied by savage repression against any opposition as the terrible, continued persecution of Julian Assange for exposing the crimes of US imperialism graphically demonstrates.

Our comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk of the Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninists has been detained by the fascistic Zelensky government in Ukraine earlier this month on false accusations of being a Russian agent. Bogdan has courageously opposed the war in Ukraine, along with his comrades in Russia, denounced both the Ukrainian and Russian regimes and fought for the unity of the Ukrainian and Russian working class.

In the US and other imperialist countries, brutal police crackdowns are taking place against protesters opposing the Gaza genocide with thousands of arrests including of students.

The ongoing anti-war protests in universities and cities are significant, but on their own are incapable of halting the bloodbath. For seven months, the Zionist regime and its imperialist backers have not only ignored protests by millions around the world, but they are also turning to police repression.

The only social force capable of halting the drive to world war is the international working class which is coming into struggle in Sri Lanka and around the world in opposition to the austerity program of the ruling classes. As governments engage in, support and prepare for war, it is workers who are forced to bear the burden.

A struggle against war requires the building of a unified anti-war movement of the working class based on a socialist program, exposing the futility of protest politics and all the apologists for imperialism. Appeals to capitalist governments are bankrupt. The independent mobilisation of workers on this basis needs to take up the fight to free Assange and Syrotiuk as well.

The burning need is for a new revolutionary leadership in the working class based on socialist internationalism to abolish the source of militarism, austerity, authoritarianism and all sorts of social misery—the capitalist system.

The Minister of Education, Prof Tahir Mamman said this at the 2023/2024 Pre-departure briefing of Bilateral Education Agreement Scholars to Russia in Abuja on Tuesday. The first batch of students are already on their way to the airport for departure, while the second and third batches would depart on November 15 and November 17 respectively.

Represented by the Director of Universities Education in the ministry, Rakiya Ilyasu, Mamman advised the scholars not to see the opportunity as uncontrolled freedom to do things that would be to their disgrace.

He explained that the country had invested a lot in them and as such required the returns of investment on their return to the country.

“Note that you are few out of thousands who secured this opportunity which you must not take for granted. Your parents and teachers would also be happy with your succor.

“Your selection is part of a broader plan which ensures that brilliant Nigerians, especially those that cannot afford to study programmes that are not readily available in Nigeria, are supported to get necessary knowledge, skills and competence that would be useful in Nigeria’s development agenda.

“I am happy to inform you that in spite of the global economic meltdown, the number of our development partners have increased and many of them now offer scholarship to Nigeria.

“As you prepare to travel out, ensure to uphold and eschew good values, focus on your studies and be a good ambassador of your country,” he said.

The Minister also charged the scholars to always strive to abide by the laws of their host country and as well remember to be their brother’s keeper in their new environment.

“Most importantly, you need to make your presence known to the Nigerian Embassy in Moscow. This is very necessary based on our experiences from Ukraine.

“Your parents are also spending a lot of resources on you. Note that we all expert you return to our dear country at the end of your studies to assist Nigeria to become a better place by contributing your quota to its development, using your new knowledge and skills,” he added.

Also speaking, the Director, Federal Scholarship Board, Asta Ndajiwo said the journey began in November 2022 with applications from thousands of Nigerians which later translated to the nomination of the candidates. Ndajiwo commended the Federal Government efforts especially in the payment of the scholars allowances from September to December.

She also advised the scholars to do away with any extracurricular activities that could take their lives, recalling an incident with previous two scholars who lost their lives while swimming in a pool.

16,EN_UA_103667.txt,"Desperation and Diplomacy: North Korea's Tech Hunt in Russia Amid Sanctions 

 For several decades, North Korea has masterfully balanced its relations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia, maintaining a relationship with the latter that is both complex and ever-changing.

The dynamics have shifted notably since Russia found itself sanctioned and isolated by the international community following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Since then, North Korea and Russia have grown increasingly close, as recently seen when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited eastern Russia, where he held a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.

After a six-day visit, Mr. Kim returned to Pyongyang on Sunday.

Sanctioned by the international community, North Korea desperately needs Russian technology for nuclear weapons, satellite development, and food production.

Similarly, Russia, also facing sanctions, urgently seeks to replenish its dwindling front-line supplies with large quantities of ammunition from North Korea.

Before the summit, when asked whether Russia would assist North Korea in developing artificial satellites, Mr. Putin confirmed this was a primary reason for their meeting.

Both sides appear willing to overlook the threat of escalated international sanctions against them.

During their summit, Mr. Kim vowed to “fully and unconditionally support” Moscow.

Rocket technology holds particular interest for Mr. Kim and his regime.

From Outward Support to Clandestine CyberattacksAccording to reports, North Korea has long eyed Russian technology, resorting to cyber theft to obtain it, and it is something that Moscow now appears ready to overlook despite recent reports such as one by Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC).

The MTAC report indicates that between March last year and this March, North Korean cyber operatives launched attacks on Russian aerospace research facilities and penetrated academic institutions engaged in research. Additionally, the operatives sent phishing emails to personnel within Russian diplomatic agencies.

The study further revealed that the countries most frequently targeted by North Korean cyberattacks during the same period included South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Russia.

The hacking groups, identified as ScarCruft and Lazarus, covertly installed digital backdoors within the company’s systems to exfiltrate sensitive information. While the full extent of the hackers’ achievements remains unclear, North Korea announced significant advancements in its ballistic missile program mere months after the cyber-attacks were initiated.

SPUTNIX, a private enterprise affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Space Research Institute, lost a substantial amount of information to these cyber incursions. The report speculates that North Korea may have stolen critical technology related to the design of ultra-small satellite bodies.

Experts suggest North Korea’s successful launches of rockets equipped with reconnaissance satellites this year likely capitalized on its prior hacking exploits. These cyber activities appear crucial in advancing the country’s space technology.

Additionally, the report disclosed that in 2020, North Korean hackers penetrated the internal network of Russia’s Almaz-Antey, a leading manufacturer of surface-to-air missiles. The intruders pilfered various information, including developer personal data and proprietary details on missile components.

In 2019, North Korean cyber operatives also exfiltrated design blueprints from Russia’s Uralvagonzavod tank factory, the entity responsible for producing Russia’s next-generation T-14 Armata battle tank.

Moreover, the report highlighted the frequency of North Korean cyber-attacks against Russian defense corporations specializing in avant-garde weapon systems like hypersonic technologies and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

Military commentator Xia Loshan told The Epoch Times on Sept. 10 that both North Korea and Russia are in a desperate situation.

“While North Korea is eager to acquire military technology, the ultimate decision is not in their hands,” Mr. Xia stated, emphasizing that the alliance is precarious and likely unsustainable in the face of stringent international sanctions.

Independent analyst Zhuge Mingyang also weighed in.

“In a relationship marked more by utilitarian needs than genuine alliance, both nations recognize the other’s motivations,” he told The Epoch Times.

“Moscow likely knows full well that Pyongyang is siphoning off its military technology but seems willing to turn a blind eye in exchange for much-needed ammunition—a clear example of a ‘friendship’ based on mutual expediency.”",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Glaciers Give the Lie to Global Warming Narrative

According to the Gospel of the Global Warming Hoax, 1850–1910 was the coldest period of the past millennium. Yet glaciers were retreating rapidly. Now that the planet allegedly has a fever, the retreat has slowed dramatically and even reversed:

Our moonbat rulers canceled the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age for failing to comply with climate ideology. But preventing glaciers from growing is more difficult than doctoring the historical record to support climate con man Michael Mann’s spurious hockey stick graph.

Shyam Bishen, the head of the Centre for Health and Healthcare, opened the panel dedicated to “Disease X” at the annual World Economic Forum globalist gathering that is taking place this week in Geneva, Switzerland.

Bishen said that he has been working on sustainability and resilience in healthcare for a long time and that we need to prepare the healthcare system for the “looming crisis of climate change.”

He said that this can be achieved through disease surveillance. “How do we make sure that we have a good global data system that can be accessed quickly so that the private sector can come up with countermeasures whether it be vaccines, diagnostics or therapeutics?” he asked.

19,EN_UA_000568.txt,"Russia Responds to UK’s ‘Very Dangerous’ Coup Allegations 

 Russia’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday dismissed claims from the United Kingdom that Moscow wanted to install a pro-Russia leader in Kyiv while it considers whether to invade the beleaguered Eastern European nation.

The UK further suggested that the Kremlin currently is “maintain[ing] links with” former officials including Serhiy Arbuzov, a former deputy prime minister of Ukraine between 2012 to 2014; Andriy Kluyev, first deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2012; former deputy chief of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council Vladimir Sivkovich; and Mykola Azarov, the prime minister of Ukraine from 2010 to 2014.

What’s more, the UK statement alleges that former Ukrainian Parliament Member Yevhen Murayev “is being considered” by Russia’s leadership “as a potential candidate” to lead the Ukrainian government.

The UK did not provide evidence for its claim. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss asserted, however, that Moscow must deescalate tensions and “end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy.”

But over the weekend, Russian officials said the UK’s Foreign Office should stop publishing “nonsense” and “disinformation.”

The embassy further alleged that the UK’s strategy is to accuse “Russia of plotting ‘inevitable’ invasion of Ukraine and try to play the role of an ideological leader, defending itself from ‘autocrats’ and aiming to ‘free the world.’”

Murayev, meanwhile, responded to the UK’s statement by dismissing the claim.

In a message to Reuters, Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian adviser to the presidential office, said the allegations should be taken seriously, acknowledged there was doubt among Ukrainians as to whether Murayev was “too ridiculous a figure” to be the Kremlin’s pick to lead Ukraine. But he added that Russia had propped up previously minor figures in leadership positions in annexed Crimea and separatist-held Donbass.

Therefore “one should take this information as seriously as possible,” he said.

On Saturday, U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne appeared to endorse the UK assessment that the Kremlin is plotting to install a Moscow-friendly puppet administration.

“This kind of plotting is deeply concerning,” Horne said. “The Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically-elected partners in Ukraine.”",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
20,EN_CC_100044.txt,"The bottom-up Brussels green revolution 

 A Belgian region’s environmental and social conditions for research funding offer a possible model for the EU.

By Anthony King

In the EU and Belgian capital Brussels, Barbara Trachte reflects the strengths of a third governmental layer in Europe: its numerous regions.

Trachte is secretary of state of the Brussels-Capital Region responsible for the economic transition and scientific research. The first member of Belgium’s French-speaking Green party to be put in charge of an economic portfolio, she shows the scope for bottom-up EU policy changes.

Setting an example

Trachte helped put in place a Brussels law that, starting in 2024, has made regional subsidies for research organisations, companies, public administrations and civil society conditional on respect for social and environmental standards. She believes the EU should do the same for its €95.5 billion research programme known as Horizon Europe.

‘Sometimes you need a revolution – or at least a mini revolution,’ Trachte told Horizon Magazine.

She said that Europe’s regions have a key role to play in advancing the continent’s transition to a net-zero economy.

With the EU seeking to become climate neutral by 2050 under the European Green Deal, Horizon Europe has placed increasing emphasis on projects to hasten the switch towards clean energy and away from fossil fuels and to ensure the process is socially fair.

Already the third-biggest part of the EU budget, Horizon Europe would have even greater impact on green and social matters across the continent by following the example set by the Brussels-Capital Region.

In a nutshell, €50 million of subsidies granted annually by the region for research and innovation require recipients to respect a do-no-harm principle and have a positive impact on the environment or social equality, according to Stephanie Lepczynski, who is Trachte’s policy adviser.

‘We are showing the way and we hope that this can influence the European Commission by encouraging it to put environmental, social and governance criteria into the eligibility of Horizon projects,’ Lepczynski said at the European Research and Innovation Days event in Brussels on 20-21 March 2024.

Secrets to success

Gender and transborder-cooperation requirements currently in place for EU funding help ensure greater diversity in research teams and produce scientific results that better reflect the make-up of society, according to Lepczynski.

She said that social and environmental conditionality in Horizon Europe would force researchers systematically to check that they’re acting for the common good and help ensure that funding advances EU green and social goals.

Trachte said such conditions will also be merited in the successor programme of Horizon Europe, which runs for seven years through 2027.

‘I wish for the next EU framework programme to decide the same – to have a greater impact and make a bigger contribution to the objectives of the European Green Deal,’ she said.

For Trachte, EU projects can have the most impact where academic, industry, government, civil society and the environment interact.

This is known as the “quintuple helix” approach to innovation. It has led governments increasingly to prioritise public involvement in innovation processes.

‘This ensures that research is rooted in society and geared towards finding solutions to today’s major societal challenges such as climate degradation, growing socio-economic inequalities or democracies,’ Trachte said.

Mission driven

She singled out as particularly important the five Horizon Europe “Missions”: adapting to climate change, fighting cancer, restoring oceans, cleaning up soil and establishing 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030.

‘The five Missions are a very innovative tool to make the societal challenges stand out – in particular the triple crisis of climate, biodiversity and pollution and the health challenges related to it,’ Trachte said.

In Brussels, the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission was notably successful in bringing together regional and local administrations as well as other partners from the private sector.

‘The enthusiasm created behind the Missions has mobilised many different actors,’ Trachte said.

The views of the interviewees don’t necessarily reflect those of the European Commission.

 by Mac Slavo, SHTF Plan:

Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned that if the United Kingdom signs an imminent deal with Ukraine to put troops in the country, Moscow would consider it as a declaration of war. Medvedev was reacting to the imminent signing of a security agreement between London and Kiev.

Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, issued his warning in a social media post.

A visit to Kiev on Friday by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is set to sign a security agreement with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, would ensure British troops would be openly deployed to Ukraine.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Sunak’s arrival in the Ukrainian capital is meant to “set out a major new package of support and reaffirm the close UK-Ukraine partnership,” his office said in a statement. The security document is a follow-up to agreements reached by G7 and NATO members last year, it noted. The statement did not mention any plans for a British military deployment in Ukraine, however, it could be implied.

“[The deal] formalizes a range of support the UK has been and will continue to provide for Ukraine’s security, including intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training, and defense industrial cooperation,” Downing Street said, according to a report by RT.

The British government has pledged £2.5 billion ($3.2 billion) in military aid to Ukraine over the next two years, including in the form of thousands of military drones, which London said will be the largest of their kind ever received by Kiev. Most of the UAVs will be made in the UK, the announcement added. –RT

Moscow has repeatedly accused the UK (and the United States) of helping Ukraine organize attacks against Russia, particularly in the Black Sea. The Russian Defense Ministry has claimed that British military personnel already have a presence in Ukraine.

24,EN_UA_102034.txt,"Most Taiwanese do not view US as ‘trustworthy’, but majority trusts its security commitment for island: Survey 

 A majority of Taiwanese do not consider the United States a “trustworthy” country, despite expressing belief in Washington’s security commitment to the island, according to a recent survey conducted by National Chengchi University in Taipei.

According to South China Morning Post, the annual survey, which polled 1,211 Taiwanese adults in September, found that only 34 per cent agreed that the US is trustworthy, maintaining the same level as the previous year when it fell from 43.4 per cent in 2021.

Yet as American credibility remained stable, more than 50 per cent did not deem the US “trustworthy” in the survey of 1,211 Taiwanese adults conducted in September, although China fared significantly worse.

Analysts attribute this skepticism to the unfolding events in Ukraine and how the US government responded to Russia’s invasion.

“We suspect that the drop may have come from the occurrence of the Ukraine war and how the United States government responded,” South China Morning Post quoted Hsin-Hsin Pan, a member of the survey team at Taipei’s Soochow University, as saying.

“Washington’s handling of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine indicates to many Taiwanese how the US might respond if Beijing were to engage in armed conflict with the island,” Pan added.

Despite the mixed views on the US, perceptions of China were consistently negative.

Only 9.3 per cent of respondents considered China “trustworthy,” a slight decrease from last year’s 9.4 per cent and 13.5 per cent in 2021. China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has asserted its intention to reunite it with the mainland, even if force is necessary.

While the US does not officially recognise Taiwan as an independent country and adheres to a one-China policy, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 legally binds Washington to “provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character” and maintain the capacity to resist any form of coercion.

President Joe Biden has reiterated the US commitment to intervene militarily should China use force against Taiwan.

The survey also indicated strong support for American arms sales to Taiwan, with over 65 per cent of respondents expressing approval. Approximately 57 per cent believed that the US would use force to assist Taiwan if Beijing attempted to unilaterally change the status quo.

The findings highlight a notable gap between the overall credibility of the US and the credibility of its security commitment to Taiwan. Analysts emphasise that more people are willing to assign credibility to the US security commitment to Taiwan than to the US overall.

Regarding the question of whether Taiwan and China belong to the same country, about 78 per cent of those polled rejected this idea.

Notably, more than 50 per cent of Kuomintang party members or supporters, who generally favor closer ties with Beijing, also asserted that Taiwan and China are not part of the same country. This suggests a disconnect between the KMT party stance and the beliefs of its support base.

As Taiwan approaches its presidential election scheduled for January 13, the political landscape is becoming increasingly complex.

The election is expected to focus on local health and welfare issues, as well as relations with Beijing and the island’s sovereignty.

With regional tensions rising, the outcome of the election is seen as a potential turning point for the island’s future relations with China and the United States. The winning party will play a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of these relationships amidst evolving geopolitical challenges.

 BRAZZAVILLE, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President William Ruto said on Saturday that Kenya will lift visa requirements for all Africans by the end of 2023 with the aim of boosting trade with African countries.

""By the end of this year, no African will need a visa to enter Kenya. The time has come to understand the importance of doing trade between us,"" said Ruto, while speaking at the summit of the world's three major forest basins, namely the Amazon, Congo, and Borneo-Mekong Forest Basins, in Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of the Congo.

Ruto noted the low rate of intra-African trade and urged to reduce customs tariffs within the African continent to accelerate the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area.

""It is time we realize the importance of trading among ourselves and allowing goods, services, people and ideas to move freely across the continent,"" he said, adding that trade among East African Community countries had grown significantly due to the removal of visa requirements and tariffs.

Ruto said that acknowledging and providing incentives to countries in tropical forest basins for forest protection is a smart climate action.

The Amazon basin in South America, the Congo basin in Central Africa, and the Borneo-Mekong basin in Southeast Asia collectively constitute 80 percent of the world's rainforests and contain approximately two-thirds of its biodiversity.

 West silences activists at home while promoting rights abroad – report

Democratic governments suppress protests at home but preach human rights abroad, Climate Rights International has said

Rich democratic nations are deploying harsh measures against climate change activists, while criticizing states in the Global South for similar actions, according to a report by Climate Rights International.

The report highlights the increasingly “heavy-handed treatment” of eco activists in Australia, Germany, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, the UK, and the US, emphasizing that authorities in those nations are violating their legal commitments to protect basic human rights.

According to the study, the drastic steps taken by governments in nations perceived as democratic include lengthy prison terms, preventive detention, and intimidation and harassment online and in the media.

The 70-page report entitled “On Thin Ice: Disproportionate Responses to Climate Change Protesters in Democratic Countries” also highlights how such governments criticize authorities in developing nations for not respecting the right to peaceful protest.

“Governments too often take such a strong and principled view about the right to peaceful protest in other countries – but when they don’t like certain kinds of protests at home they pass laws and deploy the police to stop them,” the executive director of Climate Rights International, Brad Adams, told The Guardian.

Judicial authorities in several countries including the UK, Germany and the US have been imposing “record-breaking” sentences for “non-violent protest,” the report said, emphasizing that some national and state governments are using preemptive arrests and detention of those suspected of planning rallies.

Governments in Western states are also adopting new laws to make the vast majority of protests illegal, and allowing more severe penalties for demonstrators, the report noted.

The researchers accused Western authorities of undermining the right to a fair trial by taking legal steps to stop juries from hearing about people’s motives for taking part in protests during court hearings.

In one UK case in July, five Just Stop Oil protesters were convicted of conspiracy to cause public nuisance by blocking a highway, and were handed the longest-ever sentences for a nonviolent protest. One of the group received a five-year sentence, while four others received four-year terms.",['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities'],['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
27,EN_CC_100069.txt,"U.K. Backs $1 Trillion Climate ‘Reparations’ I... 

 What fresh nonsense is this? Climate ‘reparations’ are coming, to compensate other countries for the ‘extreme weather’ they’ve been experiencing, which is allegedly our fault, because a model which has always been wrong said so. The U.K. has now backed the transparent scam. The Telegraph has more.

Britain has opened the door to paying climate change reparations to developing countries by supporting talks on the issue at the COP27 summit.

On Sunday, at the meeting in Egypt, U.K. negotiators backed a last-minute agreement to address “loss and damage” payments to countries badly affected by climate-related disasters.

Rishi Sunak will appear at the conference in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday, where he will pledge £65.5 million for green technology in developing countries.

The Prime Minister will say: “By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. And we can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future. That’s a legacy we could be proud of.”

Boris Johnson will also deliver a speech warning against the “naysayers” who threaten Net Zero targets.

Pakistan is leading a push by developing countries including Bangladesh and the Maldives for compensation from richer countries responsible for most of the world’s pollution.

The U.K. backed the issue being on the COP27 agenda during two days of negotiations ahead of the Egypt summit and is understood to accept that a deal must be done over the economic cost of climate change, which is forecast to reach $1 trillion by 2050.

On Sunday night, a Downing Street source said Mr Sunak planned to “scale up progress and support” for developing countries suffering the worst effects of global warming.

The Prime Minister will come under pressure in Egypt to agree to a costly deal on reparations at the same time as he draws up plans for sweeping domestic tax rises and spending cuts.

On Sunday night, Treasury sources said Jeremy Hunt had signed off up to £35 billion in spending cuts and up to £25 billion in tax hikes to fill an estimated financial black hole of £60 billion.

Labour has backed calls for the U.K. to pay other countries affected by climate change, with Ed Miliband, the shadow climate minister, calling it a “moral responsibility”.

 Putin Says West Prepared To Scapegoat Zelensky For War Failures: 'Replaced By Next Year'

Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam, where he signed at least a dozen energy and trade deals with the country's President To Lam, on his tour to shore up ties in Asia in an effort to offset the West's drive to isolate Moscow.

On his last day in the country he made some wide-ranging remarks to the press, and among the most interesting was a statement on the future of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Putin predicted at a moment things are going very badly for Ukrainian forces, and at a rare time Western media seems to be turning on Zelensky, that the Ukrainian leader will soon be replaced over his poor and unpopular decision-making. Putin suggested Washington is essentially going to make him a scapegoat.

""In the West, they simply do not want to replace him [Zelenskyy], the time is not right. I think it's obvious to anyone. They will blame all unpopular decisions on him, including lowering the [military] draft age, and that's it,"" Putin asserted, according to Russian media translation.

That's when he followed with: ""And then they'll replace him. I think it will happen sometime in the first half of next year.""

Putin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets, from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal. Indeed Zelensky's 'celebrity power' on display throughout the first part of the war, where it seemed he could simply do no wrong in the media's eyes, is waning fast.

More importantly, there are signs of large-scale dissent among the Ukrainian population as recruitment officers violently grab men from off the streets.

Despite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late, Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating. He has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power. Putin commented on this while in Vietnam:

Talks on Ukraine could take place as early as tomorrow, but Russia will use the current situation as a starting point, the president added.

""We have been conducting these behind-the-scenes talks, and what we hoped for has failed,"" Putin told reporters.

Zelensky's advisor, Alexey Arestovich, argued in 2019:— Glenn Diesen (@Glenn_Diesen) April 9, 2024

 ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Friday that his country will learn from China's experience to eradicate poverty and enhance exports to increase foreign exchange reserves, the Prime Minister's Office said.

In a meeting held in his office, Sharif said that China's success in lifting more than 700 million people out of poverty serves as a role model for Pakistan, the office said in a statement.

He added that Pakistan wants to benefit from China's experiences in increasing exports which will act as a major step to increase foreign exchange reserves and decrease poverty.

""Pakistan and China share longstanding and deep brotherly relations which are strengthening over time,"" he said, adding that China has always helped Pakistan in difficult times, for which he, along with the entire nation, is grateful to the Chinese leadership and people.

The prime minister encouraged Chinese companies to set up industries in Special Economic Zones being established under the framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Launched in 2013, CPEC, a flagship project of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, is a corridor linking Gwadar Port in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province with Kashgar in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which highlights energy, transport and industrial cooperation.

The prime minister said thorough preparations are being made for CPEC's new phase and its successful initiation will further strengthen economic relations between Pakistan and China.

The prime minister emphasized that Pakistan, being an agricultural country, is committed to adopting the modern techniques and technology of China in agriculture to increase productivity.

He also invited Chinese companies to set up plants for electric and hybrid vehicles in Pakistan to help the country achieve the goal of shifting to electric vehicles in the transportation sector to mitigate the impacts of climate change. ■",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Business Finland is hosting an unprecedented visit by a large delegation from the North American forest and wood products industry, marking a significant milestone in international collaboration. Over 60 delegates from nine U.S. states and Nova Scotia, Canada, are touring Finland to gain insights into the country's advanced forestry practices and innovative wood-based technologies.

For five days, the delegates will visit various Finnish industrial plants, research institutions, and universities.

They will explore forestry management, wood construction, and logging practices across southern, central, western, and eastern Finland. The aim is to familiarize the North Americans with Finland's forest expertise, sustainable forest policies, carbon reduction strategies, and the diverse operations of the Finnish forest industry.

Ulla Lainio, Senior Advisor at Business Finland Washington D.C., stated, ""The large group is touring industrial and forest sites to share knowledge about forestry, forest management, wood building, and logging. This visit reflects the significant interest in Finland's forest innovations.""

The delegates are particularly interested in Finland's manufacturers of forest machines and wood construction equipment, as well as new bio-products such as wood-textile fibers, wood-based building materials, and biofuels. The goal is to foster collaboration in smart forestry, forest health, wood construction, and biomass sectors.

The U.S. forest industry has traditionally been underutilized due to cheap fossil energy and abundant hydropower. However, with the Biden administration's renewed focus on combating climate change, there is a growing interest in biofuels, biomass utilization, forest fire prevention, and advanced forest management technologies. The Inflation Reduction Act provides grants and tax incentives for the forestry sector, making this an opportune time for international collaboration.

Wooden house building is common in North America, with a high demand for suppliers of wood construction equipment, prefabricated house solutions, and CLT (Cross-Laminated Timber) and LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) production lines. The delegation aims to find efficient construction solutions to address housing shortages and achieve carbon neutrality.

Finland, along with Sweden, is a global leader in the forest bioeconomy. The North American delegation seeks partners in both industry and research to support the renewal and diversification of the forestry sector.

Outi Suomi, Circular Transition for Zero Waste Mission Lead at Business Finland, emphasized, ""The forest policy is now favorable for reforms, and there is unprecedented interest towards Finland. The collaboration and mutual business opportunities for Finland's and North America's forest industries are significant.""

During their stay, the delegation will visit notable companies and research institutions, including Koskisen, Veisto, VTT, Pinomatic, UPM, Stora Enso, Metsä Group, Ponsse, University of Eastern Finland, John Deere, Business Joensuu, Natural Resources Institute Finland, Kira Hub, and Aalto University. They will also meet with over 25 forest sector companies showcasing innovative wood-based products, advanced wood construction techniques, and forest fire prevention solutions.

The delegation includes top officials responsible for forest use from Michigan, Minnesota, Washington, Colorado, Arkansas, California, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, and Nova Scotia, as well as representatives from leading research universities, sawmills, major forestry companies, forest owners, logging companies, wood architecture firms, and investors.

This historic visit is expected to pave the way for significant collaborations and advancements in the global forest industry, highlighting Finland's pivotal role in sustainable forestry and wood innovation.

31,EN_CC_200013.txt,"Biden Unveils Strict Auto Standards to Speed EV Shift 

 President Joe Biden's administration announced Wednesday revised pollution standards for cars and trucks meant to accelerate the US auto industry's shift to electric to mitigate climate change.

The rules set ambitious emission reductions for 2032 but are moderated somewhat compared with preliminary standards unveiled last April. Following carmaker criticism, the final rules give manufacturers greater flexibility and ease the benchmarks in the first three years.

Those shifts were criticized as a sop to corporations from at least one environmental group, even as the final rule won praise from other leading NGOs focused on climate change.

The final rules -- which were described by administration official as ""the strongest ever"" and would likely be undone if Republican Donald Trump defeats Biden in November -- still require a nearly 50 percent drop in fleet-wide emissions in 2032 compared with 2026 through increased sales of electric vehicles (EVs) and low-emission autos.

The rules, which dovetail with other key Biden programs to build more EV charging stations and manufacturing facilities and incentivize EV sales, establish the environment as a significant point of difference in the 2024 presidential election.

Trump has mocked climate change as a problem and cast the transition to EVs as a job-killer that will benefit China at the expense of American workers.

Biden argues that US auto builders need to take the lead in the expanding EV market.

""I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers,"" said Biden in a statement. ""Together, we've made historic progress.""

Alluding to his target set three years ago that 50 percent of new vehicles in 2030 would be EVs, Biden predicted we'll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.""

- Industry given more time -

EVs accounted for 7.6 percent in 2023 sales, up from 5.9 percent in 2022, according to Cox Automotive.

The original proposal had envisioned the EV share surging to as much as 67 percent of new vehicle sales by 2032.

Carmakers, which are midway through sweeping, multi-billion-dollar investments to build more EV capacity, criticized the initial standards as overly-stringent. They cited the limited state of charging capacity in the United States that has dampened consumer demand, as well as difficulties in supply of metals and other raw materials for EV batteries.

Following input from the auto industry, organized labor and auto dealerships, Biden administration officials decided to allow manufacturers a ""variety of pathways"" to reaching the standard, a senior Biden administration official said Tuesday.

This path could include a mix of EVs, conventional but more fuel-efficient engines, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which have seen a rise in demand of late.

Biden administration officials opted to soften year-to-year emissions improvements in the 2027-2030 period, while maintaining the same target in 2032.

Moderating the targets in these first three years ""was the right call,"" said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a Washington lobby representing carmakers.

""These adjusted EV targets -– still a stretch goal –- should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up,"" said Bozzella, adding that the extra time will allow more EV charging stations to come on-line.

- Too many 'loopholes'? -

The final standards set a fleet-wide target of 85 grams of carbon dioxide in 2032, down from 170 in 2027, according to an administration fact sheet.

Wednesday's initiative won praise from leading environmental groups including the Sierra Club and NRDC, which said the new rules ""take us in the right direction,"" according to a statement from NRDC chief Manish Bapna.

But Dan Becker, director of the climate transport campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, slammed the adjusted rules as ""significantly weaker.""

""The EPA caved to pressure from Big Auto, Big Oil and car dealers and riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150 through,"" Becker said.

""The weaker rule means cars and pickups spew more pollution, oil companies keep socking consumers at the pump, and automakers keep wielding well-practiced delay tactics.""","['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy']",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Nato in talks to deploy more nuclear weapons amid the growing threat posed by Russia and China - as top Ukrainian security chief warns Putin could firebomb Kyiv with tactical nukes if facing a 'catastrophic defeat'

Nato might deploy more nuclear weapons amid an increasing threat posed by Russia and China, according to the head of the alliance.

Jens Stoltenberg, the 13th secretary general of Nato, revealed there were live discussions among members about removing missiles from storage and putting them on standby to act as a deterrent.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Stoltenberg said: 'I won't go into operational details about how many nuclear warheads should be operational and which should be stored, but we need to consult on these issues. That's exactly what we're doing.'

It comes as the head of Kyiv's national security council said Putin could demand a tactical nuclear weapon be used if Russia's army is beaten in Ukraine.

Oleksandr Lytvynenko made the comments after G7 leaders warned any use by Russia of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons would be met with 'severe consequences', The Times reported.

Meanwhile, Mr Stoltenberg warned in Brussels of the threat from China, adding that nuclear transparency should form the basis of Nato's nuclear strategy to prepare the alliance for the dangers of the world.

'Nato's aim is, of course, a world without nuclear weapons, but as long as nuclear weapons exist, we will remain a nuclear alliance, because a world where Russia, China and North Korea have nuclear weapons, and Nato does not, is a more dangerous world,' he said.

Mr Stoltenberg claimed that China is heavily investing in modern weaponry, which includes its nuclear arsenal, which the secretary general said would increase to 1,000 possibly by 2030.

He insisted the US and its European allies are modernising their nuclear deterrent as a result of heightened threat from Russia.

'The US is modernising their gravity bombs for the nuclear warheads they have in Europe and European allies are modernising the planes which are going to be dedicated to Nato's nuclear mission,' he said.

It comes as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday accused Russia of not wanting peace, after Putin said he would only accept a ceasefire if Ukraine agreed to halt its NATO ascension plans.

Zelensky made the accusation at the end of a major diplomatic summit in Switzerland, which more than 90 countries attended, making it the largest gathering in support of Ukraine since the start of the invasion.

The conference saw the vast majority of the 90 nations who attended sign a communique in support of Ukraine sovereignty, and also called for Putin to return children stolen during the invasion.","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33,EN_CC_200007.txt,"These 8 States Plan On Banning Sale Of Gas-Powered Vehicles As Biden EPA Tackles ‘Climate Crisis’ 

 Eight states — California, Rhode Island, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington — and the District of Columbia are now on board with plans to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles within the next decade.

The plans to phase out the vehicles and switch to electric and hybrid vehicles come as the Biden administration continues to pursue its lofty climate goals in a struggling economy. The administration, for example, wants half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 to be zero-emission, despite sputtering EV sales.

All 8 of the states and D.C. have adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, and will have an outright ban on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles after 2035.

California was the first to adopt the rule, aiming to have 35% of new vehicle sales emit zero emissions by 2026, and boosting that goal to 68% by 2030.

According to the California Air Resources Board, the regulation overhauls the state’s “growing zero-emission vehicle market and robust motor vehicle emission control rules and augments them to meet more aggressive tailpipe emissions standards and ramp up to 100% zero-emission vehicles.”

As noted by Money, the states’ plans to ban gas-powered vehicles have generally not required votes from lawmakers, but have been advanced with support from governors and environmental regulators.

The EV market has struggled in recent months, as highlighted by The Daily Wire. Ford, for example, had to cut 1,400 employees from its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, rolled back the planned production number of the electric F-150 Lightnings in half, and slashed $12 billion in EV investments.

President Biden, however, is not slowing down when it comes to targeting the gas-powered vehicle industry. Earlier this month, Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set new eye-popping regulations in an effort to increase the number of electric vehicles on the road.


The new EPA rules set emission standards for vehicles made between 2027 and 2032 and would eliminate more than 7 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, setting off concerns across the nation.

For example, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) railed against the EPA’s move, calling it both “reckless” and “ill-informed.”

“The federal government has no authority and no right to mandate what type of car or truck Americans can purchase for their everyday lives,” the senator said. “This reckless and ill-informed rule will impose what is effectively an EV mandate without ensuring the security of our supply chains from nations like China and without a realistic transition plan that addresses our domestic infrastructure needs.”","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other']",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 RUSSIA has snatched nearly 300 children from a Ukrainian city in the past month sending them to military camps to become ""Russian zombies.""

Ruthless child snatchers have abducted a total of 280 kids from the annexed Antratsytiv district in Luhansk, according to a report.

The children were then taken to the Cossack cadet corps in Russia's Kalmykia region.

According to figures from Ukraine's National Resistance Center, Moscow plans to kidnap a total of 500 Ukrainian children by the end of summer.

The report claims that the children are not only abducted but sent to be ""zombified with aggressive propaganda"" by Vladimir Putin's forces.

It is estimated Russia has kidnapped well over 20,000 Ukrainian children since the start of the war, and sent them to be brainwashed and tortured.

A Ukrainian teenager told earlier this month how he was kidnapped from school and shipped off to a hellhole Russian camp.

Vitaliy Vertash, 16, told how he was stuck in a room with four others - and they were only fed soup and buckwheat while facing beatings from the ""camp employees"".

The true horrors of the ""re-education camps"" echo that of Nazi Germany, and have turned countless innocent children into ""Russian Zombies"".

Last year, a Sun investigation revealed Vlad's crony Maria Lvova Belova had headed up an organisation tasked with putting kidnapped Ukrainian children into Russian homes.

Meanwhile, up to 5,000 adults were also kidnapped by Russian forces in besieged Mariupol and sent to work camps in Russia.

Some were forced to wear overlarge Russian military uniforms that could make them a target while others dug mass graves for their fallen comrades in the Russian-held region of Zaporizhzhia.

One man who refused to dig was shot on the spot.

Thousands of Ukrainian civilians are being detained across Russia in centres ranging from brand-new wings in Russian prisons to hellhole basements.

And it is likely Russia is planning to hold much more, in line with Putin's plan of erasing the Ukrainian culture.

And Russia is planning to hold possibly thousands more.

A Russian government document obtained by The Associated Press dating to January outlined plans to create 25 new prison colonies and six other detention centers in occupied Ukraine by 2026.

The Russian dictator signed a decree in May allowing Russia to send people from territories with martial law, which includes all of occupied Ukraine, to those without, such as Russia.

This makes it easier to deport Ukrainians who resist Russian occupation deep into Russia.

Many civilians are picked up for alleged transgressions as minor as speaking Ukrainian or simply being a young man in an occupied region, and are often held without charge.

 by Xinhua writer Shi Hao

BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Over the past three months, Anhui Huasun Energy Co., Ltd. has been racing against time to make solar modules for a gigantic photovoltaic project in China's Xinjiang.

These 1.8-gigawatt modules using advanced heterojunction technology will be installed at a 4-gigawatt solar power plant, which is located on the edge of China's largest desert, the Taklimakan.

""For Chinese companies in the photovoltaic industry more than 20 years ago, raw materials, technologies and markets relied heavily on foreign countries and regions. But now, the tide has totally turned,"" Huasun's chairman Xu Xiaohua said.

In east China's Anhui Province, where Xu's company is based, the photovoltaic industry has snowballed in the past five years. The number of companies in the business with an annual revenue exceeding 10 billion yuan (about 1.43 billion U.S. dollars) rose to 11 in 2023.

The boom, which is also recorded beyond Anhui, is underpinned by China's vigorous efforts to expedite a comprehensive transition to green growth as tasks remain daunting.

China aims to raise the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption to around 25 percent of total energy consumption by 2030, which means the country must make every effort to increase the ratio by one percentage point annually in the next few years.

""The proportion of coal consumption in China's total energy consumption stood at 55.3 percent in 2023, and thus the potential for green and low-carbon energy transition is great,"" said Li Zheng, director of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University.

China is already revving up the transition to green energy. Official data released this week showed that the installed capacity of solar power came in at approximately 750 million kilowatts in the first eight months of 2024, rocketing 48.8 percent year on year, and the installed capacity of wind power grew 19.9 percent to some 470 million kilowatts.

Pan Huimin, deputy head of the National Energy Administration's new and renewable energy department, said the rapid development of the new energy sector in recent years resulted from full market competition, a sound business environment, constant tech innovation and a complete industrial chain.

To meet the requirement of exports and foster green industrial and supply chains, Chinese enterprises' demand for clean electricity is experiencing ""explosive growth,"" Pan said in the latest episode of the China Economic Roundtable, an all-media talk platform hosted by Xinhua. The new episode was broadcast Friday.

A key challenge is fully harnessing unstable wind and sunlight and transmitting power to users, often hundreds or thousands of kilometers away.

Last month, users in Beijing started receiving solar and wind power generated in the northwestern province of Gansu after the energy was delivered via extra-high-voltage transmission lines, benefiting Gansu companies in the business and meeting the Chinese capital's demand for green energy.

China unveiled an action plan last month to speed up building a ""new electricity system."" According to the document, Chinese authorities will use advanced power generation, regulation and control technologies to increase the transmission of clean electricity through the grid.

Local governments and enterprises should seize opportunities and vigorously exploit wind and solar power in line with local resources and with the capabilities of the grid to absorb the generated electricity, Pan said. ■",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 INCREDIBLE footage shows a panicked Russian pilot ejecting from his plane and watching as it crashes in a fireball after being shot down.

The explosion could be seen miles away after the jet was taken down by what is thought to be Ukrainian fire.

The fighter pilot had to release his parachute mid-air and was forced to land in an abandoned field.

The shocking first-person footage is believed to have been recorded in the summer but wasn't released until now.

It shows the Russian fighter pilot release his parachute mid-air after his Su-25SM was taken down by what's believed to have been incoming Ukrainian fire, according to a weapons tracking account on Twitter.

The aircraft nose-dives into the ground, unleashing a hellish explosion that can be seen from miles away while the pilot lands safety in an abandoned field.

It is unclear what happened to the pilot since the recording but some observers claim the flight crashed during a planned training run in Belgorod region, Russia.

It comes as astonishing footage shows the moment a Ukrainian tank opened fire in a vicious battle against Russian forces.

Fierce fighting can be seen in the video as the 46-tonne T-84 main battle tank blasts its 125mm cannon towards Putin's men during the bloody clash that is understood to have occurred near Kherson.

Ukrainian forces are seen engaging nearly point-blank with a Russian convoy who appear to have blundered into them as they drove up a dirt road.

Trucks emblazoned with the ""Z"" symbol can see attempting to rush past the tank - only for soldiers on the ground to then open fire on them.

The bearded gunner in the tank's turret ducks down as gunfire can be heard all around him.

With the snaps of bullets and the boom of tank guns, the convoy - with a truck towing a howitzer and an armoured personnel carrier - grind to a halt.

Other clips released as part of the video package shows the gunner opening fire on unseen foes with his heavy machine gun.

It's believed Mad Vlad would happily sacrifice 20 million soldiers to ensure he won the war in Ukraine and secure his future as Russia's leader, a former insider has claimed.

The chilling warning comes as fears of the war in Ukraine turning nuclear continue to grow as Russia's defence minister said a ""dirty bomb"" could be detonated in Ukraine.

Exiled former diplomat Boris Bondarev warned Putin would sacrifice millions of lives to win in Ukraine.

""He is not smart, he is just lucky. Now I think his luck is over,"" Mr Bondarev told Sky News.

""You should have no doubt about it, he may sacrifice 10 or 20 million Russians just to win this war just to slaughter all Ukrainians because it's a matter of principle.

""It's a matter of political survival to him. You have to understand that, if he loses the war, it will be the end for him.""

Bondarev added: ""After losing the war, he will have to explain to his elites and his population why it is so and he may find some problems in explaining this.

""And after that there may be opposition who will try to depose him or he will try to purge his subordinates to find some people who could be blamed for all these problems.""

Meanwhile, Russian war boss Sergei Shoigu warned that the brutal warzone is risking ""uncontrolled escalation"" as Putin's forces continue to be pushed back across the frontline.

Shoigu suggested that Ukraine could actually be the one to detonate a ""dirty bomb"" - an explosive laced with radioactive material.

And while not a true nuclear weapon, the consequences of using such a device could be catastrophic.

But it has been Russia wildly swinging the nuclear sabre during the war - and the latest allegation could be another diversion tactic.

Putin's forces like to spread as much chaos and misinformation as possible to cover their own tracks.

37,EN_UA_017831.txt,"Pence calls viral clip suggesting he cares more about Ukraine than US ‘fake news’ 

 Former Vice President Mike Pence fired back on social media after an out-of-context video clip of him suggesting he’s more interested in the war in Ukraine than issues plaguing cities across the US went viral on Friday.

In the video, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson questions the 2024 Republican presidential candidate about where his priorities lie after Pence criticizes the length of time it has taken the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with weapons to fend off Russia’s invasion of the former Soviet state.

“You are distressed that the Ukrainians don’t have enough American tanks. Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years. Drive around. There’s not one city that’s gotten better in the United States, and it’s visible,” Carlson says during a forum at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa.

“Our economy has degraded, the suicide rate has jumped, public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased, and yet, your concern is that the Ukrainians – a country most people can’t find out a map – who’ve received tens of billions of US tax dollars don’t have enough tanks. I think it’s a fair question to ask, like, where’s the concern for the United States in that?” Carlson asks Pence.

To which Pence responds, “It’s not my concern. Tucker, I’ve heard that routine from you before, but that’s not my concern.”

Several conservatives on social media seized on the clip, including Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who shared a snippet of the exchange on Twitter and wrote, “Tucker Carlson just brutalized Mike Pence for prioritizing Ukraine despite a litany of social ills afflicting America.”

The former vice president shot back at Kirk on social media, sharing a clip with his full answer to Carlson that showed him explaining that under a Pence administration, the country would be able to tackle both issues affecting Ukraine and domestic problems at the same time.

“Sorry [Charlie Kirk]. That is what we used to call FAKE NEWS. Here’s the full clip of my remarks if you’re interested,” Pence wrote in his tweet.

In the extended clip, Pence continues his response to Carlson by saying, “Anybody that says that we can’t be the leader of the free world and solve our problems at home has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on Earth. We can do both.

“And as president of the United States, we will secure our border, we will support our military, we will revive our economy and stand by our values. And we will also lead the world for freedom under my administration. I promise you.”

Pence made an unannounced visit to Kyiv late last month and became the first declared 2024 Republican contender to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The 64-year-old made the trip with Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian humanitarian organization that the former vice president previously accompanied to Poland and Ukraine, a Pence adviser said.

“I really do believe that if Vladimir Putin and the Russian military were to overrun Ukraine, it wouldn’t be too long before they cross the border where our men and women would be required to fight,” Pence, an outspoken backer of the Ukrainian war effort and providing US military support for the country, told NBC News in June.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Overpraising the West', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A Former Ukrainian MP Blew The Whistle On Burisma's Connections To Terrorism

Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

Former Ukrainian MP Andrey Derkach, who’s reviled by the Biden Administration for sharing dirt about Hunter Biden’s Burisma corruption scandal with Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani ahead of the 2020 elections, just gave a very important interview to Belarus’ BelTA where be blew the whistle even louder. According to him, the $6 million bribe that was paid in cash to shut down the investigation into the First Son’s scandal eventually found its way to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and its military-intelligence agency.

Derkach claimed to have proof of the secret court order that divided these funds between those two, with the first investing its portion into building up their country’s drone army while the second financed terrorist attacks like the assassination of Darya Dugina, which he specifically mentioned in the interview. These allegations expand upon the ones that he shared earlier this year regarding the real-world impact of Hunter’s corruption scandal, which were analyzed here at the time.

On the subject of Ukrainian assassinations and terrorism, Derkach said that the CIA and FBI actually condone these actions despite their public claims to the contrary, but he warned that this immoral policy will inevitably ricochet into the US itself. In particular, he cited FBI chief Christopher Wray’s testimony to Congress last April where he said that law enforcement officials fear that Crocus-like attacks are presently being plotted against their country.

About that, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Ukraine’s military-intelligence service GUR is the chief suspect of Russia’s investigation into what became one of the worst terrorist attacks in its history, thus meaning that the portion of Burisma’s $6 million bribe that made its way into their hands likely financed part of it. In other words, the third-order effect of Hunter’s corruption scandal is that it was partially responsible for the brutal murder of innocent civilians halfway across the world some years later.

That’s already scandalous enough, but Derkach shared even more details about the other indirect consequences of this cover-up into the First Son’s illicit activities, adding that some GUR-linked figures have been connected to the Western narrative about September 2022’s Nord Stream terrorist attack. He regards that story as a distraction from the US’ complicity, the view of which was elaborated upon here at the time that it entered the discourse, but lauded the CIA for the lengths it went to cover up its role.

In his view, the CIA might very well have sent a highly trained Ukrainian diving team to the Baltic Sea exactly as the Western media reported, though only to plant fake bombs. In his words, “when a cover story is made, it is done quite well. We shouldn’t belittle the experience of the CIA or the experience of MI6 in preparing cover operations. They have quite a lot of experience in using proxies, in using cover stories to form a certain position in order to dodge responsibility. This is actually what happened.”

Looking forward, Derkach expects Ukraine to attempt more terrorist attacks against Russia, which the US public is being preconditioned to accept via the CIA’s various leaks to the media. While many might lay the blame for all this on Zelensky’s lap, Derkach believes that it’s actually his Chief of Staff Andrey Yermak who’s running the show, albeit as a Western puppet. Nevertheless, he’s also convinced that the West is indeed preparing to formally replace Zelensky, but doesn’t yet know when or with whom.

Altogether, the importance of Derkach’s interview is that he’s a former veteran Ukrainian politician who still retains a lot of sources inside the regime, having served in the Rada for a whopping 22 years from 1998-2020. While his homeland charged him with treason after he fled to Russia in early 2022, which followed the US charging him with election meddling on behalf of that country in September 2020, the argument can be made that these are politically driven attempts to intimidate a top whistleblower.

The dirt that Derkach shared about Hunter’s Burisma corruption scandal, not to mention its newly revealed third-order effects that led to the brutal killing of civilians halfway across the world after part of his company’s bribe made its way into GUR’s hands, made him an enemy of the US Government. They and their Ukrainian proxies will therefore always try to discredit him with sensational allegations, but everyone would do well to listen to what he says and then make up their own minds about it.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
39,EN_CC_100122.txt,"Your Connection to Nature 

 I grew up in New England, on a bluff overlooking the Connecticut River. We lived in a quiet town with a village green, a local dairy around the corner, and houses lining Main Street that were built in the mid-1700s.

Unlike the deep snows that blanket Vermont in the winter, we lived farther south, in an area known for legendary ice storms. It’s like the weather can’t make up its mind whether to rain or snow, so it rains—then decides to freeze.

When I was in high school, we had the mother of all ice storms. The frozen rain had left almost half an inch of ice on everything from roads and rooftops to the tiniest of twigs. The trees, unable to bear the weight of so much ice, lost branches or were ripped from the ground completely. The branches and felled trees blocked roads and pulled down power lines. We huddled in front of our fireplace, making meals on a camp stove for the better part of a week, without power or heat.

The ice clung stayed for several days. And then one evening, the mercury climbed from below-freezing to 50 degrees in a matter of hours. My dad and I went outdoors to watch the weather change, and because we lived on a hill, we could see what was happening across much of the Connecticut River Valley.

As the thermometer rapidly rose, the tons of ice began falling from the trees and rooftops with a deafening roar. The broken power lines thawed and then lit up the sky with dangerous blue explosions of electricity.

Dad and I watched in wonder as our frozen, ice-caked world thawed. He turned to me and said, “You’ll never forget this night for as long as you live.”

My dad has been gone now for almost two decades, but that evening, his comment, is how I like to remember him. The awe of Mother Nature was unforgettable. But it was also that my dad, a slide-rule-carrying engineer would fearlessly turn to his then-snotty teen-aged daughter and express his amazement and wonder of the world. That’s what I remember most.*

I choose to remember that evening, that moment in time when I think about my dad because it makes me smile. But it was also a profound moment because my father, who was a deeply religious man, was tacitly acknowledging that our connection with nature is also about our relationship with God or the universe or however you define the divine.

The point is that when you stop, observe, and admire the incredible operating system that is nature, how can you be anything but in awe? Nature has the ability to turn a tiny seed into a tree or an ear of corn, just by adding air, water, and sunlight. It keeps the oceans just the right amount of salinity to sustain the lives of fish and other aquatic animals. Our planet provides millions of species of plants, animals, and insects everything they need to survive.

And yet, we get caught up in our lives and often lose touch with nature for long periods of time. Long enough for critical habitat to be turned into parking lots and for rainforests to be cut down. Long enough for our air to become toxic, and for the Colorado River to run empty before it reaches the ocean.

I don’t pretend to have any answers, except for the baby step of reexamining your relationship with the natural world. Stop and listen to the birds, notice how moss looks like a tiny forest, wonder at the tenacity of those plants that grow through the cracks in the sidewalk, and be in awe at how trees know to leaf out in the spring. Be the person who picks up a plastic bag blowing in the wind or who walks to your destination when possible, or who introduces native plants in your yard.

Like that moment in a melting ice storm, it’s the small moments, realizations, and actions that can help in sustaining our planet. Renewing your connection with nature combined with inspired action, multiplied by the billions of people on the planet can make a difference.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 The climate science denying group the Global Warming Policy Foundation has admitted that it shared an “erroneous” temperature dataset to support Lord Lawson’s false claims to the BBC last week that global temperatures aren’t rising.

Three days after Lawson’s BBC interview – which was immediately and widely criticised in the media and by scientists – the climate denial group tweeted out Sunday afternoon that it was “happy to correct the record” and has since removed the tweet after a request to do so by climate scientist Ed Hawkins.

According to the tweets, the graph was originally produced by US meteorologist Ryan Maue, an adjunct scholar of the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute co-founded by Charles Koch. It was published by weather forecaster and climate science denier Joe Bastardi. Both Bastardi and Maue work for WeatherBELL Analytics, a private weather consulting firm.

Screenshot of GWPF tweets taken on August 14 2017.

Thanks for acknowledging this Benny. Are you could to delete the original tweet so that this erroneous claim doesn’t spread further?

— Ed Hawkins (@ed_hawkins) August 13, 2017

Indeed. My bias, my mistake.

— GWPF (@thegwpfcom) August 13, 2017

As a number of climate scientists have been quick to point out, Lawson was wrong to claim that the average global temperature has “slightly declined” since 2007. In fact, the global surface temperature over this period has risen, with the three hottest years on record occurring in 2014, 2015 and 2016.

In addition to being a reaction to those debunking the graph’s false and misleading claims, the GWPF’s efforts to distance themselves from the inaccurate data comes one day after neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer featured a story using the same graph with the headline “It’s Colder Now Than When Al Gore Won the Nobel Prize for Kook Theory in 2007”.

 KREMLIN propagandists have called for London to be “turned to dust” after Ukraine said it would use British missiles.

The deranged ranting was part of a nightly show dedicated to pro-war discussion on state TV that’s hosted by a notorious Putin acolyte.

Last night’s show featured discussion of a report in The Sun saying Kyiv said it would use the Storm Shadow missile if the UK was willing to provide it.

At one point host Vladimir Solovyov bizarrely raised his hand as if to cast a spell, then stared manically at the camera and said: “London will turn to dust! To dust.”

Mad Vlad's mouthpiece, his face twisted with rage, then switches to English and begins shouting: “Burn in hell!” and “Flames!”

Solovyov was responding to a panellist who made a wildly exaggerated claim about a news story published by The Sun.

He fumed: “The British press is saying ‘We’ll give them hell! I’m quoting verbatim from their most popular paper The Sun.

“They all regard this as completely fine - ‘Russians can and need to be killed’. They’re saying that constantly.

“There’s one problem with Russians. They won’t give up as easily as that.”

The clip and its translation was tweeted by BBC Monitoring, which regularly posts on pro-Kremlin propaganda shows.

It comes after Volodymyr Zelensky asked for 600mph British missiles when he visited the UK recently with a shopping list of weapons.

Ukrainian defence sources Kyiv would be prepared to use the missiles to strike Crimea

It followed a warning from Zelensky that longer-range weapons from western allies would allow Ukraine to take the battle to areas occupied by Russian.

""It will allow us to make the evil completely retreat from our country by destroying its airbases deep in the occupied territories,” he said during his visit.

In response, Rishi Sunak said “nothing is off the table” when it comes to military support for Ukraine.

The Government is still weighing up whether to send deadly Harpoon anti-ship missiles or surface-to-air Storm Shadows to arm Ukrainian defenders.

After Germany finally agree to send tanks, Solovyov, and other Kremlin propagandists threatened nuclear strikes on the West.

In a similar rant he claimed it meant Germany had joined the war.

Solovyov said: ""It’s time to send a clear, resolute message that we now consider Germany a direct party to the conflict, rekindling memories of World War Two.

“German tanks appearing [in Ukraine] will definitely mean we consider German territory, military bases and other sites as legitimate targets.”

Raging Moscow TV pundit Yevgeny Satanovsky said warheads should be launched on the German capital Berlin and the country’s parliament, the Bundestag.

“Flat, slightly radioactive, melted-down ground [will remain in its place].”

Ukrainian defenders are bracing for an assault that could include 1,800 tanks, 3,950 armoured vehicles, 400 fighter jets and 300 helicopters incoming from Russia.

 Israel to respond to genocide charges at UN’s top court

Israel will respond to charges of genocide at the United Nations’ top court on Friday after South Africa filed an urgent request with the court to order a ceasefire in Gaza.

It is the third time the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has held hearings on the Israel-Hamas war since South Africa filed proceedings at The Hague court in December.

On Thursday, South Africa told the court the situation in Gaza has reached “a new and horrific stage”, and urged the 15 judges to take urgent action.

Israel must “totally and unconditionally withdraw” from the Gaza Strip, said Vusimuzi Madonsela, South Africa’s ambassador to the Netherlands.

South Africa has submitted four requests for the ICJ to investigate Israel. According to the latest request, the country says Israel’s military incursion in Rafah threatens the “very survival of Palestinians in Gaza”.

During hearings earlier this year, Israel strongly denied committing genocide in Gaza, saying it does all it can to spare civilians and is only targeting Hamas militants. Israel says Rafah is the last stronghold of the militant group.

In January, judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.

The court has already found that there is a “real and imminent risk” to the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israel’s military operations.

“This may well be the last chance for the court to act,” said Irish lawyer Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, who is part of South Africa’s legal team.

ICJ judges have broad powers to order a ceasefire and other measures, though the court does not have its own enforcement apparatus.

A 2022 order by the court demanding that Russia halt its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has so far gone unheeded.

Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced since fighting began.

The war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 in which Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.

Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in its count.

South Africa initiated proceedings in December 2023 and sees the legal campaign as rooted in issues central to its identity. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Blacks to “homelands”. Apartheid ended in 1994.

On Sunday, Egypt announced it plans to join the case. Several countries have also indicated they plan to intervene, but only Libya, Nicaragua and Colombia have filed formal requests to do so.

 WALL Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has had his latest appeal blocked by a judge in Moscow after he was locked up on bogus spy charges.

The 31-year-old American appeared in a glass-walled dock after being brought from the tough jail where he has been held since March.

He lodged an appeal against a Moscow court judge's earlier decision to extend his pretrial detention into late November.

But today, the judge refused to hear the case and instead sent it to a lower court because of ""procedural violations"".

Gershkovich bravely smiled from behind the defendant's glass cage in a yellow jumper and kept his hands in the pockets of his jeans.

US ambassador Lynne Tracy was present at the hearing.

The US journalist was arrested in March 29 on trumped up charges of ""espionage"", which Gershkovich, Washington and The WSJ vehemently deny.

Russian officials have not yet provided any public evidence to back up their allegations.

No date has been officially set for his trial, however Putin's spooks continue to extend his detention - which today reached 174 days.

He will now suffer behind bars in the notorious Lefortovo prison until at least November 30.

Most read in The Sun

The WSJ's Moscow correspondent's pretrial detention was originally supposed to expire on May 29 - but appeals for his release have been repeatedly denied.

This expiration was pushed back to August 30, and was then extended into late November.

He has failed in two previous appeals, in April and June.

Under Moscow's criminal law, the 31-year-old could face a pretrial extension of up to 12 months.

Putin's arrest of Evan has previously been branded internationally as a ""cowardly act"" as the despot desperately tries to escape accountability over his war in Ukraine.

His arrest marked an increasingly ferocious crackdown on media freedom in Russia.

It is the first time Russia has brought a spy case against an overseas journalist since the end of the Cold War, and he faces a jail term of up to 20 years if convicted.

His employers called the arrest ""a vicious affront to a free press"" that ""should spur outrage in all free people and governments throughout the world"".

“No reporter should ever be detained for simply doing their job,"" The Journal added.

Washington has repeatedly stated that charges against Gershkovich are bogus and baseless and has demanded his immediate release.

They have deplored his ""wrongful detention"" as a method of ""hostage diplomacy"" designed to give Russia leverage at the bargaining table at a time when relations between the two countries have plunged to their lowest point in more than 60 years.

US officials said in July that there was still no clear ""pathway"" to getting him home, despite high-level talks.

44,EN_UA_013710.txt,"Operation Babylift and the Hypocrisy of the International Criminal Court 

 by Kurt Nimmo, Kurt Nimmo on Geopolitics:

In the “collective West,” hypocrisy rules the narrative, most recently in regard to the ICC and the “kidnapped” children of Ukraine.

In America, the scurrilous neocon and warmonger propagandist Max Boot weighed in on the meaningless and unenforcible decision to arrest President Putin. Boot’s argument is delusional, but then neocons thrive on lies and delusions.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Propaganda, pure and simple. Boot is an accessory to mass murder, having advocated the invasion of Iraq, the slaughter of over a million Iraqis, and the engineered destruction of their country.

The hypocritical ICC didn’t bother to contrast and compare Putin’s supposed abduction of Ukrainian children to an organized mass kidnapping of Vietnamese children. It was dubbed “Operation Babylift,” ordered by then President Ford, and was conducted at the end of the Vietnam War as the USG evacuated, having lost the war.

The Vietnamese children abducted without permission were described as “orphans,” although many had parents and relatives that were left behind. 3,300 children, described as “infants” (many were older children), were parceled out to families in America, Australia, West Germany, and France.

The “rescue” of these children was an organized act of kidnapping pure and simple, yet in the Land of Amnesia, millions of Americans know nothing about it (or, for that matter, the Vietnam War itself and the brutal destruction of Southeast Asia).

In 1975, a class action suit was filed in San Francisco on behalf of the kidnapped children.

“The suit seeks to enjoin adoption proceedings until it has been ascertained either that the parents or appropriate relatives in Vietnam have consented to their adoption or that these parents or relatives cannot be found,” The Adoption History Project notes. “The Complaint alleged that several of the Vietnamese orphans brought to the United States under Operation Babylift stated they are not orphans and that they wish to return to Vietnam.”

A statement issued on April 4, 1975, by “professors of ethics and religion,” pointed out that many “of the children are not orphans; their parents or relatives may still be alive, although displaced, in Vietnam… The Vietnamese children should be allowed to stay in Vietnam where they belong.”

The operation was celebrated by the corporate media and “Hollywood’s celebrity elite… [and, as a propaganda event] generated a spectacle of celebration and emphasized that the babies were more than just average orphans,” writes US History Scene.

Uncritical acceptance of the Vietnam war orphans did not last long. A variety of American voices that ranged from child psychologists to news reporters to the casual observer soon began asking whether the evacuation served the best interests of the children. This concern followed closely on the heels of criticism over U.S. motivation for the evacuation. Much of this controversy began when the unclear orphan status of some of the children came to light. The government of South Vietnam reluctantly allowed so many children to leave the country only under the condition that those who left would already be in the adoption process. Volunteers processing the children found that not all of them fit into this category of orphan. In the processing centers, some of the children told the volunteers that they were not orphans and had families living back in Vietnam.

Naturally, Operation Babylift is all but forgotten today. It would be counterproductive to the onslaught of USG and ICC propaganda, not directed at the welfare of children, but rather as a crude “informational” device to further turn opinion against Russia’s SMO to denazify and disarm Ukraine and, in addition, prevent NATO from undermining Russian national security.

 Sweden says enough!

Sweden’s Prosecution Authority is bringing charges against none other than their homegrown eco-hoaxer, Greta Thunberg, for disobeying law enforcement during a climate protest in June.

The 20-year-old is facing potential fines or imprisonment of up to six months.

The charges stem from her involvement in a protest that allegedly led to major traffic disruption in Malmö in June, authorities said.

“The prosecutor has filed charges against a young woman who, on June 19 this year, participated in a climate demonstration which, according to the prosecution, caused disruption to traffic in Malmö,” the statement said. The woman “refused to obey the police command to leave the scene,” it added according to CNN.

While the prosecution authority’s statement did not specifically name Thunberg, a spokesperson for the Swedish Prosecution Authority, Annika Collin, confirmed to CNN that the individual referred to in the charges is indeed Greta Thunberg.

“The criminal classification is disobedience to law enforcement. According to the prosecutor, the act was committed with intent,” the prosecution authority’s statement added.

Irma Kjellström, a spokesperson for Ta Tillbaka Framtiden, told CNN that Thunberg was among several young people who participated in blocking the oil tankers.

Kjellström added, “After having blocked the industry which is burning our future, we have now been charged with crime. While charges are being brought against us, the real crime continues inside the gates that we blocked.”

Recently, Greta Thunberg was back in the news after her prediction that the world would end in 2023 was a conspiracy.

On June 21, 2018, she made a bold claim on Twitter, stating that humanity had a narrow five-year window to stop the use of fossil fuels or face inevitable extinction.

“A top climate scientist is warning that climate change will wipe out all of humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years.”

Thunberg shared a now-deleted Grit Post article by Scott Alden citing a prediction from James Anderson, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at Harvard University, titled, “Top Climate Scientist: Humans Will Go Extinct if We Don’t Fix Climate Change by 2023.”",['CC: Criticism of climate movement'],['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Paranoid Putin tries to hide ‘cancer battle’ by making bombshell medical files SECRET as weak ruler fears being toppled’

PANICKED Vladimir Putin has dramatically classified bombshell data which appears to prove he has been treated for cancer.

Rumours have persistently swirled that the tyrant, 70, is ""critically ill"" - fuelled by his bloated face and trembling legs.

Bombshell spy documents leaked to The Sun appeared to confirm Putin has pancreatic cancer and early-stage Parkinson's disease.

Now the panicked Russian leader has desperately classified medical files that reveal an apparent cancer battle as he fears a coup inside the Kremlin.

A loophole previously allowed investigative journalists to show that the dictator was constantly accompanied by a top thyroid cancer specialist and other medics.

Revelations last April indicated surgeon Yevgeny Selivanov, of Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital, had flown to Putin no less than 35 times in Black Sea resort Sochi.

More on Putin

The proof of Putin’s treatment by cancer doctors was deduced from the existence of contracts with the hospital which were listed on a Russian public procurement website.

Now such details have been made top secret, preventing public knowledge of current and future contracts.

Earlier it was seen that Putin was accompanied by between six and 13 medical specialists on his trips.

Medics were also seen to be on standby near his favourite official residences outside Moscow, for example in Sochi and Valdai.

Most read in The Sun

The report by Proekt media in April gave credence to rumours that Putin had suffered from cancer.

Medics appeared to be thyroid and ENT specialists.

It comes after it was revealed the Russian government has built a secret network of rail lines that lead to Putin's residences - and train stations nearby.

The blocking of data of such contracts was revealed by Sirena, part of Radio Liberty.

KREMLIN COUP?

The move is likely to increase speculation that the Kremlin is hiding the truth about Putin’s health during the war against Ukraine.

Symptoms of thyroid cancer include the appearance of a thick nodule in the thyroid area; hoarseness of voice; difficulty swallowing; pain in the neck and throat; enlarged lymph nodes in the neck; a dry cough, scratchy or scratchy feeling in the throat or behind the sternum.

There have also been claims that Putin is suffering from abdominal cancer and other ailments.

Meanwhile, there have been suggestions that drugs to treat his cancer may have distorted his mind when he launched the war in Ukraine.

The Kremlin insists that Putin is healthy.

Among the medics named as treating Putin were Dr Dmitry Verbovoy, an expert in acute illnesses, injuries and poisonings.

Another was Dr Konstantin Sim, an orthopaedic traumatologist, possibly helping with ice hockey injuries, ENT doctor Alexei Shcheglov and infectious disease specialist Yaroslav Protasenko.

He was also seen by neurosurgeons from the Central Clinical Hospital, led by department head Oleg Myshkin and Dr Elena Rastrusina, plus a resuscitator

Dr Pavel Sharikov, and head nurse Lyudmila Kadenkova.

A rehabilitation specialist was also involved, Dr Mikhail Tsykunov.In July 2020, Putin met with the head of the National Medical Research Center for Endocrinology, Ivan Dedov.

It comes after the former head of MI6 suggested said there could be a coup inside the Kremlin to oust Putin - but the mechanisms for political change in Russia are ""fragile"".

Sir Richard Dearlove told The Sun: ""I think we're heading into another phase where you're going to get a political upheaval as a result of a war gone badly wrong.

47,EN_CC_100042.txt,"Protest-Driven Change 

 Safeguarding the interests of the wheat growers, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s decision to increase the wheat procurement target demonstrates a positive shift in government policy and reactiveness.

In a powerful example of peaceful and legitimate protest, the farmers’ protest was successful in influencing the policies of the state. The complaints of delays in wheat procurement and the exploitation by flour mills that were offering rates lower than the government-mandated price have been heard and addressed by the state.

The government’s decision not only addresses the grievances of the farmers but also reflects its willingness to listen to the concerns of the citizens and adjust government strategies in a timely manner – something we have been governmentally lacking for quite some time now.

The PM directed the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited to ensure the swift buying of wheat from these farmers. This is the epitome of how citizens can hold the government accountable, reforming the governance policies and driving a positive change in society.

However, the issue of wheat prices is still an issue – one that may not exactly be in the hands of the state. Support prices set by the provincial governments vary, as can be seen in the case of Balochistan and Sindh. Their respective prices are not adjusted to the recent inflation and have been carried on from last year’s wheat prices.

This is further aggravating the concerns of the farmers who are facing a higher cost of production owing to the higher energy and fertilizer costs. Not only does this make it challenging for the farmers to receive fair compensation for their produce, but it also does not take into account the impact of global warming that has further worsened their troubles. Heavier showers this year have adversely affected the harvesting season and crop yields for these farmers, and this needs to be accounted for.

The government’s efforts to address their concerns are a good step, but we need to extend more support to them in these difficult times. If we want to be more proactive in our governance, then considering the long-term implications of climate change on our agriculture will be wise moving forward.

Unpredictable weather patterns and extreme precipitation disproportionately affect our farmers, jeopardizing their sole source of income. As such, the state must stand by vulnerable farming communities and formulate policies to mitigate the impact, ensuring sustainable agricultural development in the nation.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 by Eric Zuesse, The Duran:

First here, are a group of lies that all are false, all for the very same reason — that they all blatantly contradict the actual (as is to be documented here) history (just click onto each given lying phrase below, to see instances in which the given false phrase has been reported as being instead true — and, then, I shall here document them all to be not just false but the reverse of truth, the exact opposite of the reality):

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine” (commonly used in U.S.-and-allied official Government statements).

“unprovoked war in Ukraine” (two typical examples using it are this and this).

“Russian aggression against Ukraine” (two typical examples using it are this and this).

Any alleged report that employs any such phrase is propaganda — lying ‘news’ or ‘history’ — that bases itself upon the false unstated assumption that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 started the war in Ukraine, instead of responded to a war in Ukraine that U.S. President Barack Obama’s Administration (including Joe Biden) — the American Government — had actually started there, in 2014, against Ukraine’s adjoining nation of Russia. America is planning ultimately to invade Russia from the only nation that is only 300 miles away from Moscow (Russia’s central command — far closer than Cuba was to Washington DC during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis).

Here, as proven in the links, are the historical facts, documenting the U.S. Government’s increasing aggression against Russia — using Ukraine as its primary springboard in its plan to conquer Russia:

The Obama Administration perpetrated in February 2014 a bloody Ukrainian coup (hidden behind popular anti-corruption Ukrainian demonstrations that the CIA and State Department had trained and organized local racist-fascist anti-Russian Ukrainians to lead) overthrowing the democratically elected President of Ukraine and replacing him by a racist-fascist (ideologically nazi) regime that immediately replaced Ukraine’s generals with ones to ethnically cleanse pro-Russian Ukrainians and kill some and terrorize the others to flee into Russia so as to get rid of the people in the Ukrainian regions that had voted 70% or more for that democratically elected President — and this ethnic cleansing would enable the nazi U.S.-installed regime in Ukraine to be ‘democratically elected’, and so to continue the U.S.-Government’s control over that country, on Russia’s border.

For the full details, see this.

So: all three of those phrases (“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”, “unprovoked war in Ukraine”, and “Russian aggression against Ukraine”) are lies, which reverse the aggressor (purportedly Russia, but actually America) and the defender (purportedly Ukraine — which is America’s proxy in its war against Russia — but actually Russia).

The war in Ukraine started with Obama’s coup, not with Putin’s ultimate response to it (which occurred soon after America’s rejection on 7 January 2022, of Russia’s demand, NOT to allow Ukraine into NATO).

America’s plan here is to place its missiles on Ukraine’s border with Russia, only a five-minute-missile-flight away from blitz-nuking The Kremlin and thereby beheading Russia’s central command — too fast for Russia to be able to launch its retaliatory missiles.

 Erdogan – Moscow and Kiev agree exchange of 200 prisoners

Russia releases captured Western mercenary fighters – Reuters

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has mediated the release by Russia of ten foreign combatants in the Ukraine conflict, Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry announced on Wednesday. Hailing from five countries, the mercenaries had been captured while fighting for Kiev.

The prisoners, who are citizens of Croatia, Morocco, Sweden, the UK and the US, were transferred from Russia to Saudi Arabia by Saudi authorities, according to a statement from the ministry. Saudi officials are now “facilitating procedures for their safe return to their respective countries,” the announcement continued.

Bin Salman personally negotiated the release, which took place as part of a wider exchange of prisoners of war between Russia and Ukraine, the ministry added.

The full details of the POW exchange are unclear, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Moscow and Kiev had agreed to exchange 200 prisoners. This exchange would be the largest such swap since Russia’s military operation in Ukraine began in February.

Erdogan, whose government helped broker a deal earlier this summer to restart grain shipments from Ukrainian ports, said this exchange represented “a very important step.”

In addition to receiving tens of billions of dollars worth of Western arms, Ukraine has leaned heavily on foreign mercenaries to bolster its military. According to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, more than 2,000 of these foreign fighters have been eliminated by Russian troops and the militias of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics.

Shoigu said on Wednesday that just over 1,000 foreigners remain active in the ranks of the Ukrainian military. The Russian minister added that more than 150 NATO officers and advisers are in Kiev, where they are planning and commanding Ukraine’s forces.

 Letters to the Editor: No, Korean BBQ isn’t going away because of L.A.’s new gas law

To the editor: As an Asian American and advocate for healthier, safer communities for all, I was really disappointed by the article, “The end of Korean BBQ in L.A.? What the gas stove ban means for your fave restaurants.”

People in my community freaked out over the headline, re-sharing this misleading article many times on social media. Simply put, the truth is this: Our favorite restaurants will be fine, as the city of Los Angeles’ ban on most gas appliances in new construction does not apply to existing buildings or existing Korean BBQ restaurants. Their kitchens do not have to be altered due to this measure.

I talked to people who re-shared the article online who did not understand this simple truth based on your headline and article.

That said, I appreciated some commentary in the article about the concerns of chefs who are used to cooking with gas and are thinking about opening new restaurants. It is my hope that chefs across L.A. can discover new ways to cook without harmful gas.

The wok was invented thousands of years ago and used without fossil fuels, and today, we have induction cooking, which I can personally attest is a wonderful way to cook without toxic emissions. We’re all in this together, so let’s act now to deliver a healthier future for generations to come.

Jennifer Ho, La Crescenta

..

To the editor: The California Restaurant Assn. is on the wrong side of history in its opposition to all-electric kitchens. Sadly, this is not the first time restaurant associations have opposed public health and safety measures. In fact, restaurant associations once fought smoke-free laws, with funding from Big Tobacco.

To protect public health and reduce climate emissions from gas stoves, our kitchens and homes will need to be upgraded from gas to electric. Thankfully, induction cooking is a superior cooking technology that keeps kitchens cooler and safer. For chefs cooking primarily with woks, there are electric woks.

Climate change and the health dangers of gas are not going away. Instead of ignoring the problem or fighting health-protective solutions, our field must innovate to continue to prepare the dishes we love safely for our families and customers — and the planet.

 A top mosquito expert has blasted Professor Dame Jenny Harries’s claim that climate change will make dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases common in the U.K. within 20 years, branding it “entirely fictional” and “shameless”.

Professor Harries, who heads the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA), recently said that rising temperatures will make such diseases common in the U.K. by 2040 because the Asian Tiger Mosquito – which can transmit dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever and other viral diseases – will become established throughout Britain. Dengue will become endemic in London, she claimed.

But Professor Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and a leading expert in mosquito-borne diseases, has ridiculed her claims. He told Net Zero Watch:

The natural range of the Tiger mosquito, an Asian species, extends from the tropics to regions where mean January temperatures are around –10°C. Northern strains are able to survive because in late summer, as days grow shorter, the eggs they lay are dormant and remain unhatched until spring arrives.

It is true that since the late 1970s, there has been rapid global spread of the Tiger mosquito to the United States, Latin America, Europe and across Africa, probably mainly via the global trade in used tyres. Professor Reiter says that it is beyond doubt that this has nothing at all to do with temperature.

Professor Reiter has also lambasted fearmongering about the return of malaria, noting that this was once a major cause of death in many parts of England, even during the Little Ice Age from the 1300s to the 1800s, and its disappearance was, once again, nothing to do with temperature:

Shakespeare mentions malaria – “the ague” – 13 times, so it was clearly once common here. The disease began to decline – for a multitude of reasons – in the mid-19th century, despite the upward trend in global temperatures.

Net Zero Watch Director Andrew Montford said:

This is not the first time we have seen the Civil Service misleading the public in this way. Science is being misused to generate fear and to ‘nudge’ us in a desired direction. This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute.

But it seems our public officials won’t miss an opportunity to bang the climate alarmist drum as they attempt to cajole and coerce the public into accepting radical cuts in living standards to ward off threats based solely on the perennially wrong outputs of biased computer models.

 President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused US politicians of playing political games around the issue of aid for his country and claims that they don’t care how many people in Ukraine are dying.

Zelensky made his comments as US lawmakers prepared to vote on a controversial aid package for Ukraine that has been stalled in Congress for months due to a bitter dispute between Democrats and Republicans.

RT reports: In an interview on Monday, Zelensky referred to comments made at the weekend by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. The US politician told Fox News that he planned to move forward with a vote on an aid bill for Israel this week, without specifying when a Ukraine package would be taken up, or whether it would be tied to funding for West Jerusalem.

“This is pure politics, and it’s a disgrace for the world and a disgrace for democracy,” Zelensky told PBS NewsHour. “Nobody cares how many people are dying in Ukraine every day. They only care about their approval ratings,” he added

Johnson has since promised to advance the long-stalled Ukraine aid bill sought by President Joe Biden this week, multiple news outlets reported on Monday. Johnson reportedly told Republican colleagues at a closed-door meeting that he intends to allow the House to vote on a standalone bill in the coming days that would ensure additional military aid for Kiev. The House will also be expected to vote on separate bills providing more assistance to Israel and Taiwan.

House Republicans have previously refused to back the foreign aid bill unveiled by Biden in October, which includes $61 billion in assistance for Ukraine.

The legislation has been held up for months as the GOP tries to force the White House to crack down on the influx of illegal immigrants via the southern US border. Biden’s 2024 election rival, former President Donald Trump, previously urged Republicans to block the bill, arguing against unconditional aid for Ukraine.

The delay in approving more weapons for Ukraine has rattled Zelensky and other officials in Kiev, who are blaming mounting battlefield losses on shortages of foreign-supplied ammunition and air defenses.

In his interview with PBS, Zelensky reiterated that without the US support, Ukraine “will have no chance of winning” in its conflict with Russia.

Moscow, meanwhile, has repeatedly stated that no amount of foreign assistance will change the outcome of the fighting, and has accused the West of escalating the hostilities.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

 Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has promised he is ""ready to fight"" following reports of multiple Ukrainian mayors being kidnapped by the invading Russian military.

Ukraine has accused Russian forces of capturing mayors in Dniprorudne and Melitopol in recent days, sparking concerns that additional mayors could be kidnapped next, including the mayor of the country's capital city.

Klitschko, who was a highly regarded world heavyweight boxing champion before entering politics, insisted during a Fox News interview on Monday that any Russian soldiers who hope to capture him would find that their task was ""not easy.""

""I am ready to fight,"" Klitschko said after America Reports host John Roberts asked him about a potential kidnapping attempt. ""This will be not easy to do that ... nobody feels safety in our country right now in this very difficult situation. Everyone [is] ready to fight, ready to defend our city.""

""I am not worried about kidnap,"" he added. ""I am ready to fight, that's why I have weapons, that's why it's my hometown and I want to defend the interest of my citizens, the interest of my home, the interest of my family.""

Ukrainian officials announced the kidnapping of Dniprorudne Mayor Matveev Sergeevich on Sunday, while they said that Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov was captured two days earlier. Russia went on to appoint a Moscow-friendly mayor in Melitopol.

While commenting on the kidnapping of Fedorov, which was partially captured on video, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserted that ""the actions of Russian invaders will be equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists.""

Klitschko suggested that the kidnappings were part of a pattern of ""un-human"" Russian troops choosing to ignore the international rules of war, noting that mayors are civilian targets.

""War also has rules,"" said Klitschko. ""But Russians [don't] want the rules ... what they want is the symbol ... they can't break the mood of the people and that's why they kidnap the mayors.""

""Its actually against all rules,"" Klitschko continued. ""We see how unfriendly, how un-human activity make Russians in our land.""

Following Russian bombing campaigns on Monday, the Kyiv mayor surveyed scenes of damage in the city alongside his brother Wladimir Klitschko, who is also a former world heavyweight boxing champion.

""That's what Russia's war against the civilians looks like,"" Wladimir Klitschko said while standing in the rubble in a video uploaded to Twitter. ""Destroyed buildings, destroyed infrastructure. [A] city bus just got hit by a rocket. Lives are getting lost, that's the war that Russia started.""

According to the Ukrainian government, Monday's Russian strikes on Kyiv also included a missile hitting a nine-story residential building, leaving two dead and three others hospitalized.

Newsweek reached out to the Embassy of Russia in Washington, D.C., for comment.

 China shares inclusive development with the world: Former Director-General of UNESCO

Former Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, receives an exclusive interview with People's Daily Online in Beijing, Sep. 10, 2024. (People's Daily Online/Zhang Wenjie).

China's modernization and inclusive development have helped 1.4 billion Chinese people, set examples, and shared experiences with other countries, benefiting the world as a whole, said Irina Bokova, former Director-General of UNESCO.

Bokova, who is also the Honorary Dean of the School of International Organizations at Beijing Foreign Studies University, visited China several times and voiced her appreciation for China's rapid progress over the last several decades, stating that China's tremendous economic, social, and technological advancements have contributed significantly to the experience of the globe. She also noted that through cooperation mechanisms such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, China is fulfilling its obligation to share its inclusive growth with other countries.

""UNESCO and China have together developed many joint activities, partnerships and initiatives, among my most memorable moments was President Xi Jinping's visit to UNESCO a decade ago,"" Bokova told People's Daily Online during an exclusive interview.

In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at the headquarters of UNESCO in Paris, laying out his vision of civilization that features diversity, equality and inclusiveness.

""We need to encourage different civilizations to respect each other and live together in harmony while promoting their exchanges and mutual learning as a bridge of friendship among peoples, a driving force behind human society, and a strong bond for world peace,"" President Xi said.

""President Xi's speech about diversity is very important, it shows that though we belong to different cultures, we are all members of one shared community,"" said Bokova.

According to Bokova, China is fulfilling its responsibility to share its success with the rest of the world by promoting collaboration and inclusive development. For example, China was the first developing country to realize one of the UN Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, making a significant contribution to the global poverty alleviation cause.

""China's commitment, inclusive development, and strong leadership demonstrate to the world that equality and inclusion in society are attainable. This benefits not only the Chinese people, but also other countries around the world,"" added Bokova.

Bokova has also praised China's ""new quality productive forces"". With innovation playing the leading role, new quality productive forces are forces that feature advanced productivity and are free from traditional economic growth modes and productivity development paths. They are defined by high-tech, high efficiency and high quality, and are in line with the new development philosophy.

""It is a very interesting and innovative concept China is taking. I think it is justified because the world and global economy are entering a new phase, and it is critical to use innovation and technology to encourage young people to use all of the potential of science to achieve equality and social inclusion, as well as to address challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss,"" said Bokova, adding that ""new quality productive forces"" have the potential to reconcile humans with nature while maintaining all of the benefits of technological progress.

 Putin’s masses of HIV-positive prisoners choosing to go to meat-grinder frontline rather than rot in jail with no meds

RUSSIAN prisoners who have tested positive for HIV are choosing to be sent to the frontline hoping to get lifesaving medication.

A large number of Vladimir Putin's HIV-positive prisoner recruits deemed they preferred the battlefield rather than rot in jail where they were denied treatment.

The Wagner Group has been mass-recruiting inmates from Russia's infamous prisons, offering them a pardon if they survive for six months.

Ukrainian officials estimate about 20 per cent of recruits in Russian prisoner units are HIV positive.

And a lot of them were so desperate for the anti-viral medications they couldn't get in jail, they opted to join Putin's bloody war in Ukraine, the New York Times reported.

Speaking from a detention centre in Dnipro, an HIV-positive Russian soldier named Timur, 37, told the newspaper: ""Conditions were very harsh.""

He said how doctors in prison changed the anti-viral medication to a different type that he suspected was not effective.

Fearing he was not going to last his ten-year sentence behind bars, agreed to join Putin's bloodthirsty Wagner Group for six months in exchange for a pardon and supplies of anti-viral medications.

Speaking about the dilemma of poor treatment in prison or fight in Ukraine, he said: ""I understood I would have a quick death or a slow death. I chose a quick death.""

Timur, who had no military experience said he had two weeks of training before being deployed to Bakhmut- where one of the bloodiest battles of the war happened.

Most read in The Sun

He said that the unit's commanders ""repeated many times, ‘if you try to leave this field, we will shoot you.’""

While he was captured, he said that most of the soldiers were killed on their first day.

Another soldier named Ruslan, 42, said he welcomed Wagner's acceptance of HIV-positive inmates and joined the frontline for a chance at medication and freedom.

He said: ""If you have a long sentence, it gives you a chance to begin life again.""

New conscripts in Putin's private army were forced to wear coloured-coded wristbands to signify they had serious infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's Ministry of Defence claimed that Russia marks these ""sick 'fighters' with appropriate bracelets on their hands"".

""In order to 'mark' infected militants, the command of 'Wagners' forces them to wear red bracelets on the arm in case of HIV, and white bracelets in case of hepatitis,"" the Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence said in a statement.

The report suggested that Russian conscripts were furious about having to serve alongside ""infected"" militants and military doctors regularly refused to provide assistance to the infected soldiers if they got wounded on the battlefield.

Another HIV prisoner Yevgeny who suffered a gunshot wound before he was captured, said that although he did receive treatment, he felt medics were careless about infecting other patients around him.

He said: ""There were no conditions for the HIV infected.

""We were all treated together, the healthy and the unhealthy.""

 Letters to the Editor: Offshore wind can be California’s next Gold Rush

To the editor: Just as the Pacific was critical in transporting miners in the rush for gold and has been key to our state’s and our nation’s epic transoceanic commerce, it can now usher in our next Gold Rush in the form of offshore wind power.

Kudos to Michelle Solomon and Taylor McNair for reminding readers that this form of clean, renewable energy blowing along our coast needs only to be harnessed with floating wind turbines and transmitted via infrastructure to our population centers, facilitated by Inflation Reduction Act financial incentives.

The technology is available, the seed money to pay for the launch of this promising enterprise exists and the need for offshore wind energy could not be greater as the climate crisis ravages much of the world.

Gov. Newsom, this is your summons to even bolder climate leadership.

Ginger Osborne, Laguna Beach

..

To the editor: California stands to benefit from cleaner air, good-paying jobs and reliable energy with offshore wind technology. But policymakers need to pass legislation that locks in investment and resources for offshore wind to ultimately succeed in our state.

California should start by ensuring a market exists for the clean power that offshore wind will create. To do that, the Legislature should pass AB 1373. This piece of legislation ensures central procurement for offshore wind, meaning the Public Utilities Commission will start requiring utilities and companies servicing Californians’ electrical needs to have a diverse portfolio of clean energy sources — including offshore wind.

Lawmakers need to kick-start offshore wind in California, and they can start by passing AB 1373.

Dan Jacobson, Elk Grove, Calif.

To the editor: I agree that California should become a leader in building and deploying floating wind turbines. And while we can help this “nascent” technology emerge, we shouldn’t wait for it to mature to deploy offshore wind.

There are many unsightly oil platforms not far off the coast, particularly in Huntington Beach and Long Beach. These are grounded. We should deploy grounded wind turbines at similar depths and distances.

 Fetterman drapes himself in Israeli flag during DC rally in support of the Jewish state

Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) draped himself in an Israel flag as he joined the nearly 300,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, DC, Tuesday in support of the Jewish state as it wages war against Hamas terrorists.

The Pennsylvania Democrat was photographed at the March for Israel rally with the blue and white flag wrapped over his trademark hoodie as he greeted attendees.

Fetterman has been unequivocal in his staunch support of Israel since Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack despite facing some left-wing backlash over his stance.

“Of course I’m here, how could I not!” Fetterman told one rally-goer, according to an attendee’s X post.

A sharp-eyed X user pointed out that Fetterman used the strings on his hoodie to affix the flag to himself in “the most bipartisan act I’ve ever seen from a Senator.”

Fetterman’s fondness for the Israeli flag triggered several pro-Palestinian protesters outside the US Capitol last week, after the senator emerged from the building waving a small Star of David flag above his head as some demonstrators were being arrested.

“Shame! What a joke!” some of the booing protesters shouted as Fetterman strolled by.

In his office, the senator also displays the posters of the innocent Israelis kidnapped by Hamas terrorists during their deadly raid which also killed 1,200 people.

“They will stay up until every single person is safely returned home,” Fetterman noted in a video posted on X.

Fetterman has also argued against a cease-fire in the conflict, which has reportedly angered some of his supporters and former staffers.

“Now is not the time to talk about a ceasefire. We must support Israel in efforts to eliminate the Hamas terrorists who slaughtered innocent men, women, and children,” the former lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania said in anOct. 18 post on X. “Hamas does not want peace, they want to destroy Israel. We can talk about a ceasefire after Hamas is neutralized.”

Fetterman, however, has remained a harsh critic of congressional Republican efforts to decouple US military aid for Israel from a separate aid proposal for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion.

On Tuesday he called on his GOP colleagues in the upper chamber to cease efforts to pass a stand-alone Israel aid bill.

“Israel and Ukraine are going through existential threats. We need to send aid to BOTH, and my Republican colleagues need to cut the crap,” Fetterman wrote on X.

 Russia ‘could split off from global internet’ – and US fears that Russian web could look like China’s Great Firewall

RUSSIA could split off from the global internet as the Kremlin cracks down on the web, officials fear.

As real war rages in Ukraine, Russia has is pushing ahead with an intense information war online.

A key battleground in the Kremlin's online crackdown is the Russian internet.

Several businesses have shut down their online and physical operations in Russia.

Meanwhile, Kremlin officials led by President Vladimir Putin have blocked access to some of the platforms that have not halted service in Russia.

Instagram, which is three times as popular as Facebook in Russia, was blocked by state officials.

The Kremlin’s plans to isolate Russia from the global internet predate the invasion of Ukraine.

In 2019, Russia passed the Sovereign Internet Law which redirects traffic through Russian servers – allowing a watchful Kremlin to censor the web.

In 2021, the Russian government labeled the internet a national security threat.

This month, Russia’s deputy digital minister Andrei Chernenko directed Russian websites to switch to domain name system (DNS) servers that are within Russia’s borders.

In doing so, internet operations in Russia are dependent on hardware within the country which strengthens the state’s ability to control content.

Russian citizens can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to bypass Russia’s rigid internet restrictions.

A VPN shields your IP address, hides your physical location and scrambles the record of your internet history.

But with Visa, Mastercard and American Express suspending operations in Russia, many citizens have no way to pay for web tools to help them evade Russian censorship policies.

Kremlin crackdown

The Russians' work to domesticate the internet is not unlike the Chinese Great Firewall internet policy.

China governs the internet with intense scrutiny and has loads of restrictions against international websites.

The Chinese government has ownership over internet channels and lends access to people and businesses.

Chinese internet users rarely explore web pages that are based or created outside of China.

FreedomHouse, a nonprofit focused on analyzing the strength of freedom across the world, ranked the Chinese internet as one of the least free in the world with a score of 10/100.

The United States, for comparison, has an internet freedom score of 75/100.

In fracturing the internet, China and Russia leave citizens just with state-approved networks as their only source of information.

""They want the ability to move to not one big global network but different networks where you can surveil your citizens more easily,” Karen Kornbluh, an expert on US-European diplomacy, told NBC News.

“In the longer term, Russia wants to be able to cut off access to Signal,” Kornbluh said.

Signal is a secure messaging app used by journalists to avoid government snooping – and it's now the fastest growing app in Russia.

RT, one of Russia’s state-controlled media networks, has pushed false justifications for the invasion of Ukraine and has come under fire for other propagandist tendencies.

 Republican lawmakers will probe the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and large private investors for their role in pushing an environmental agenda throughout the financial sector after the midterm elections.

Republican Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said that investigating the Biden administration and Wall Street’s use of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) principles will be a major focus of his committee if Republicans gain a majority in the House on Nov. 8, according to The Washington Post. The lawmakers argue that large financial institutions have withheld investment from businesses that they don’t consider to be eco-friendly based on their ESG criteria. (RELATED: Kentucky Officials Demand Proof That State Pension Funds Aren’t Used For Woke Investing)

“My view is that ESG investing is a cancer within our capital markets,” Barr told the Post. “It is a fraud on American investors.”

Barr and other Republicans hope to force SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to answer questions on the agency’s proposed climate disclosure rule, which would require all publicly traded companies to disclose their carbon emissions and climate change risks, the Post reported. The rule could allow climate-focused investors to more easily discern the “climate risks” of certain businesses and pressure them to become more eco-friendly.

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska introduced a bill in May to combat major investors’ influence and will continue discussing such actions with industry executives, his spokesman told the Post.

“We’ve become the loud noise in their right ear after all the screaming in their left ear,” Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said about GOP efforts to push back against Wall Street firms’ climate-focused investment strategies, according to the Post.

Republican Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri and ranking member on the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions told the Post that he wants to force BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street executives to testify in front of the financial services committee as the three massive money managers have used their financial influence to push companies to adopt their climate agenda and other political movements.

BlackRock, which manages nearly $8 trillion in assets, has been scrutinized by Republican attorneys general and state treasurers over its alleged failure to place the interests of its investors above the firm’s stance on climate change.

The Republicans are expected to take back the House in the midterm elections and will hold a majority in the House Financial Services Committee as well as other committees that can be used to probe the SEC, banks and asset managers.

 Moscow court rejects Evan Gershkovich’s appeal, keeping him in jail until at least June 30

Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich will remain jailed on espionage charges until at least late June, after a Moscow court Tuesday rejected his appeal that sought to end his pretrial detention.

The 32-year-old U.S. citizen was detained in late March 2023 while on a reporting trip and has spent more than a year in jail, with authorities routinely extending his time behind bars and rejecting his appeals. Last month, his pretrial detention was continued yet again — until June 30 — in a ruling that he and his lawyers challenged. A Moscow appellate court rejected the appeal Tuesday.

In the courtroom on Tuesday, Gershkovich, wearing a white T-shirt and an open checked shirt, looked relaxed, at times laughing and chatting with members of his legal team.

His arrest in the city of Yekaterinburg rattled journalists in Russia, where authorities have not detailed what, if any, evidence they have to support the espionage charges.

U.S. journalist marks a year in a Russian prison as courts keep extending his time behind bars

Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich marks a year behind bars Friday following his arrest by Russian authorities who accuse him of espionage.

Gershkovich and his employer have denied the allegations, and the U.S. government has declared him to be wrongfully detained.

Analysts have pointed out that Moscow may be using jailed Americans as bargaining chips in U.S.-Russian tensions over the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine. At least two U.S. citizens arrested in Russia in recent years — including WNBA star Brittney Griner — have been exchanged for Russians jailed in the United States.

In December, the U.S. State Department said it had made a significant offer to secure the release ofGershkovich and Paul Whelan, another American imprisoned in Russia on espionage charges, that it said Moscow had rejected.

Officials did not describe the offer, although Russia has been said to be seeking the release of Vadim Krasikov, who was given a life sentence in Germany in 2021 for the killing in Berlin of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of Chechen descent who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany.

A Russian court extends the pretrial detention for American reporter accused of spying

A court in Moscow ruled to keep Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in custody pending his trial on espionage charges.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, asked this year about releasing Gershkovich, appeared to refer to Krasikov by pointing to a man imprisoned by a U.S. ally for “liquidating a bandit” who had allegedly killed Russian soldiers during separatist fighting in Chechnya.

Beyond that hint, Russian officials have kept mum about the talks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeatedly said that while “certain contacts” on swaps continue, “they must be carried out in absolute silence.”

Gershkovich is the first U.S. reporter to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since 1986, when Nicholas Daniloff, a Moscow correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, was arrested by the KGB. Daniloff was released 20 days later in a swap for an employee of the Soviet Union’s United Nations mission who was arrested by the FBI, also on spying charges.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Josep Borrell, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, called Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó’s accusation that the European Union is “pro-war” completely unacceptable,

“This is totally unacceptable. The European Union is not in favor of war. The European Union is not on the side of war,” Borrell said, adding that the EU is supporting Ukraine in its war against aggression by Russia and wants to end the war in accordance with the UN Charter.

Borrell also said the “unacceptable approach” of the Hungarian government regarding Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s visit to Moscow and Kyiv would be discussed at a separate meeting on Monday.

Borrell noted that member states should be looking at how investment and funding could help Ukraine, such as by restoring its damaged electricity infrastructure as soon as possible and providing additional air defense systems.

“These are the two most important things right now,” he stressed.

Borrell also commented on the opinion issued by the UN International Court of Justice (ICJ), which was delivered on Friday, according to which Israel’s settlement policy and use of natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territories violate international law and Israel must pay reparations to the Palestinians for the damage caused by the occupation.

He said that these conclusions were largely in line with the EU position, which he said was fully consistent with UN resolutions on the status of the occupied Palestinian territories.

 The G20 leaders are set to state that today's era ""must not be of war"" at the summit in Bali, a British newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing a draft communique agreed by diplomats involved in the negotiations to finalise the document.

The key line on the Ukraine conflict in the draft communique almost echoes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's message to Russian President Vladimir Putin in September that 'today's era is not of war'.

There have been a series of negotiations among the diplomats of the G20 member countries over the formulation relating to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia and China are also members of the G-20 which operate on the principle of consensus.

In his bilateral meeting with Putin in Uzbekistan on September 16, Modi said ""today's era is not of war"" and nudged him to end the conflict.

The Indian delegation played a big role in achieving consensus among member states over the wording criticising the Russian invasion, the Financial Times (FT) said, citing two unnamed officials with knowledge of the negotiations.

Prime Minister Modi and several leaders of the G20 countries touched upon the Ukraine crisis in their remarks at the grouping's summit that began in Bali on Tuesday.

World leaders will state that today's era ""must not be of war"" at the G20 summit in Bali, according to a draft communique agreed by diplomats that also condemned threats of nuclear weapons use, the newspaper said.

""The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Today's era must not be of war,"" the draft statement said, according to FT.

The communique was agreed by country delegates on Monday night but must still be signed off by G20 leaders at the two-day summit, the report said.

The G20 ""will make clear that Russia's war is wreaking havoc for people everywhere"", the report said, quoting a senior US official.

An Indonesian official said discussions on the draft statement were ""still dynamic"" and might change, it said.

In his address at the summit, Modi on Tuesday referred to his repeated call for resolving the crisis through talks.

""I have repeatedly said that we have to find a way to return to the path of ceasefire and diplomacy in Ukraine. Over the past century, the Second World War wreaked havoc in the world,"" he said.

Since the Ukraine conflict began in February, Prime Minister Modi spoke to Russian President Putin as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a number of times.

In a phone conversation with Zelenskyy on October 4, Modi said that there can be ""no military solution"" and that India is ready to contribute to any peace efforts.

 UK intelligence experts are concerned that Russia will use “fabricated” claims regarding chemical weapons in Ukraine to move forward with a “false-flag operation.”

“Russia could possibly be planning to use chemical or biological weapons in a ‘false-flag’ operation. Such an operation could take the form of a faked attack, a staged ‘discovery’ of agents or munitions, or fabricated evidence of alleged Ukrainian planning to use such weapons,” officials said, adding that such a “false-flag” attack would “almost certainly be accompanied by extensive disinformation to complicate attribution.”

Officials added that intelligence suggests that Moscow had likely intended to use false-flag operations as justification for its invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24.

However, analysts believe that the narrative is part of the Kremlin’s plan to create a false-flag operation in an attempt to justify using chemical weapons operations in Ukraine itself.

Yet both the United States and Ukraine maintain that the laboratories seek to prevent bioweapons and pathogens, a project backed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an agency within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).

In response to Russia’s allegations, State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that the disinformation being spread by Russia is “total nonsense and not the first time Russia has invented such false claims against another country.”

The UK Ministry of Defence’s report comes as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on March 13 that the Kremlin might use chemical or biological weapons in its invasion of Ukraine, which would amount to a war crime.

The NATO Secretary General echoed comments by the UK’s Ministry of Defense that Russia could be using the claims to create a false pretext to justify its actions.

“Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies.

 Ukrainians show strength at Deaflympics in Brazil

Caxias do Sul (Brazil) (AFP) – When Rymma Filimoshkina practiced the hammer throw in the yard near her house in Mariupol at the start of the Ukraine war, her neighbors thought she was throwing a bomb.

Issued on:

But her ""weapon"" isn't one of destruction: it just won the 33-year-old deaf athlete a gold medal at the Deaflympics in Brazil.

Thousands of kilometers (miles) from the conflict at home, the Ukrainian team is raking in the medals at the Olympics for the deaf, which opened on May 1 and wrap up Sunday in the southern city of Caxias do Sul.

With two days left to go in the Games, Ukraine had a commanding lead in the medal table, with a total of 116 -- more than double the second-place United States.

""In this event, we show the world we exist: we are Ukraine, a real powerful, independent and democratic country,"" said Valeriy Sushkevych, president of the Ukraine Paralympic committee.

""One soldier called us and said: in between battles, we support you on TV. Your fighting spirit in sports is very important for us,"" he told AFP.

'Really want' peace

Ukraine has a history of punching above its weight in disabled sport.

Its Paralympic program owes its success to two and a half decades of specialized schools in every region of the country for children with disabilities, who start participating in sporting programs at an early age, Sushkevych says.

Ukraine finished sixth in the medal table at the Summer Paralympics in Tokyo last year, and second at the Winter Paralympics in Beijing in March, just after Russia launched its invasion.

The team's success at the Deaflympics is symbolically charged: Ukraine had finished second in the medal table at the last three editions of the event -- behind Russia, which was banned from all international competitions over the invasion.

""I dedicate these medals to Ukraine. I'm very proud to represent my country,"" said a smiling Dmytro Levin, a 24-year-old native of Kharkiv, speaking in sign language after winning two golds and a bronze in orienteering.

""I'm happy to have won this medal for Ukraine. But all I really want is peace,"" said 15-year-old Sofia Chernomorova, who won bronze in badminton.

'Didn't hear the sirens'

Filimoshkina said she still remembers the vibrations she felt with every bomb that exploded in Mariupol, the port city devastated by relentless Russian strikes.

""A lot of deaf people died because they didn't hear the air raid sirens and went outside at the wrong time,"" she said.

Her teammate Julia Kysylova, who won silver in the hammer throw, said that for a long time, she was sure they would have to cancel their trip for the Games.

""When the war erupted, it was impossible to train. I spent a month sheltering at home,"" said the 25-year-old athlete from Nova Kakhovka, in the hard-hit southern region of Kherson.

She finally managed to flee to Spain, leaving her husband behind.

""It was a miracle we managed to cross the border. The trip took more than two days,"" she said.

""After the Games, I hope to go back home and be with my husband,"" she added.

""But I don't know if that will be possible.""

Criticizing Soviet society was a serious crime in those days, but I doubt that the Russians ever considered arresting Nixon and giving him a ten year stretch in the gulag for “anti-Soviet agitation.” Not even Maoist China at the height of its Cultural Revolution would have considered such a thing.

But late last week, on the eve of a Russia-China leadership summit in Moscow, Europe’s International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the man who controls the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, whose striking power is further enhanced by its revolutionary hypersonic delivery systems.

The charges against Putin were that he had ordered the humanitarian evacuation of children from the dangerous Ukraine warzone, and the ICC also ordered the arrest of Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights.

Yet oddly enough, no ICC action had ever been taken against American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had famously declared in 1996 that the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children brought about by the American economic sanctions she supported was “worth it.”

Indeed, in 2016 National Security Advisor John Bolton leveled harsh threats against ICC judges if they dared take legal action against any Americans accused of torture and murder, and many have noticed the strange lack of ICC even-handedness over the years.

But issuing a press release or even an arrest warrant does not necessarily determine events in real life, and the Moscow summit between Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has hardly been disturbed. Taken together, Russia and China control a substantial fraction of the world’s natural resources and industrial capacity, and although their global propaganda presence is weak, those former factors are more important as elements of real world power.

As an example of this, last week Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of the most important Middle Eastern countries, announced in Beijing that after negotiations held under Chinese auspices they had reestablished diplomatic relations despite many years of bitter hostility:

Over the last few months, America and its Western allies have declared their unilateral right to set a cap on the price Russia charges for its oil, seeking to use their dominance over the international financial infrastructure to reduce Russian revenue on its sale of natural resources to other countries.

Russia and Saudi Arabia are two of the world’s leading oil exporters, and with the latter nation now having dramatically shifted towards the Russia-China alliance, its leadership recently declared that they would ban sales to any country that sought to impose a price cap on its oil.","['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia has international support from a number of countries and people']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

 by Leo Hohmann, Leo Hohmann:

Using duplicity, deception and secret alliances, the U.K.’s inner circle of top elites led by Nathaniel Rothschild, King Edward VII, and Lord Alfred Milner backed the German Kaiser into a corner and intentionally set the Germans up to blame them for starting the First World War, when in fact it was the British who provoked the Germans to the point where war was the only option.

German generals were caught strategizing several weeks ago on how to bomb Russia’s main bridge to Crimea. This would be an act of aggression that Russian President Vladimir Putin described as guaranteed to draw a harsh military response from Russia, possibly even including a nuclear strike against Berlin.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

And that has led to an admission by German officials that their military is woefully unprepared to take on Russia. If German generals and politicians truly want to provoke a war with Russia, they had better slow down and wait for their military to catch up to the political rhetoric coming out of Berlin.

A March 14 article by John Cody at Remix News shows that the German Army lacks the personnel, equipment and infrastructure to wage a major war of any kind, let alone with a nuclear-armed military superpower like Russia.

“Germany’s own military and government are painting such a dire picture of the armed forces that there are now calls from some of the most powerful politicians in the country to reinstate mandatory military service,” Cody writes.

Yes, a military draft.

A video produced by Remix News details testimony provided by Eva Högl, German Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, who provided catastrophic details about the state of the German military. It is shocking in terms of its candor regarding the current state of the German armed forces.

She finds it “really impressive” that Germany has emptied out its military defense stocks by handing it over to Ukraine to be wasted in a losing war with Russia. That sounds like an admission of treason in the wide open.

But wait. There’s more.

Germany knows it is incapable of taking on Russia so it is negotiating a secret deal with the insane leaders of two other European countries, France and Poland, for the very purpose of sending troops into Ukraine separate from NATO, although I do not believe this could truly be done without the acquiescence of Washington and London.

An organization called the Weimar Triangle – composed of France, Germany and Poland – has been in existence since 1991 at the fall of the Soviet Union.

The stated purpose of the Weimar Triangle was to assist Poland’s emergence from Communist rule. It’s strange that it still exists but it may have found a new purpose – instigating World War III with Russia.

According to Wikipedia, “the Weimar Triangle exists mostly in the form of summit meetings between the leaders of the three countries and of their foreign ministers. The collaboration between member states includes inter-parliamentary contacts, military, scientific and cultural co-operation. The most recent summit of leaders occurred in Paris on June 12, 2023.” (Emphasis mine)","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Zelensky Seeks To Cancel Russia At UN, Asks Why ""Russian Terrorists"" Have A Place

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is trying to use his visit to the United Nations in New York to get Russia canceled from the international assembly. He questioned how it is that ""Russian terrorists"" have a seat at the UN. He also warned that Russia is poised to expand its war beyond Ukraine - an assertion with no evidence.

""If in the United Nations there is a place for Russian terrorists,"" Zelensky said, ""it’s a question to all the members of the United Nations."" ...Except that of course Russia doesn't hold just any UN seat, but it's permanent member of the UN Security Council, and exercises veto power in that capacity over the UNSC's most important resolutions and major decisions.

Zelensky made the comments on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), when he visited a hospital in Staten Island which is treating some 18 wounded Ukrainian soldiers. Zelensky has long warned that the UN is ""hostage"" to Russian policy.

As for his UNGA speech the same day, given before some 140 nations, and after Biden spoke earlier, Zelensky went on the verbal attack against Russia, giving comments in English.

""The goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our lives, our resources into a weapon against you, against the international rules-based order,"" Zelensky said. He laid out that Russia is weaponizing essentials for survival like food and energy.

""The goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our lives, our resources into a weapon against you, against the international rules-based order,"" Zelensky said, also seeking to portray a pattern of Putin's ""aggression"" from Georgia to Syria to Moldova.

He also alleged Moscow is committing ""genocide"" - and repeated media claims of Russia having ""kidnapped"" some tens of thousands of children. ""Time goes by; what will happen to them?” He then called it ""clearly a genocide.""

However, these reports of ""Russia kidnapping children"" have been based on the trend of Russian-speaking families of the Donbas in many cases willingly relocating to Russian territory, also given there had been a civil war raging there since 2014 involving pro-Kiev Ukrainians attacking pro-Russian Ukrainians in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Zelensky also used it as an occasion to condemn any potential peace plan offered by a third party which requires that Ukraine cede territory. The New York Times wrote, ""Ukraine has been seeking backing for a 10-point settlement program that demands a full Russian withdrawal and payment of reparations.""

""Zelensky pitched the audience an idea for a summit with that program on the agenda -- something Ukrainian diplomats say would be a symbolic success, even without any means to enforce such a settlement on Russia,"" the report noted.

The UN audience applauded when at the end of his remarks Zelensky said the world must work to ""end the aggression on the terms of the state that was attacked."" He's expected to later travel to Washington, where he'll lobby for billions more in American taxpayer dollars to be pledged toward the war effort.

Recently, some readers have complained to me that we are covering the Ukraine situation too closely, saying they are bored with the topic.

In fact, I’m not really covering it that closely. I’m really just giving the broad strokes, and giving people a basis upon which they can do further investigation into what is going on if they are so inclined.

If readers find the coverage boring, they can skip over it. There is a lot of other stuff on this site. I am covering the Ukraine the exact right amount. I am obligated to do this because so few outlets are covering the war with any truth or honesty. In the English language, the pro-Russia perspective is very difficult to find, with most conservatives who are against the war simply saying that they don’t care either way. “I do care and I actively support those fighting against the Washington and Brussels elite” is an important perspective that must be in the public conversation.

Someone is going to win this conflict, and someone is going to lose. The stakes could not be any higher. The future of the entire world now hinges on the outcome of this conflict. This is the single most consequential military conflict in all of human history.

If Russia loses, the Putin government will collapse, and the US will be able to steamroll the country, break it apart into several pieces. From there, the US will have China isolated, and then eventually break them. This will result in the final establishment of a singular world order run by the Jewish power centers in the United States, Europe, and Israel.

If the US loses the war, we are looking at a freefall collapse of the Western economic and military order, a rising China, and a reshuffling of the entire order of power on the planet earth.

The reason I support Russia is that I want the US empire to collapse. The reason I want the US empire to collapse is that I do not believe that the US empire is compatible with freedom in the US, and believe that we can only reestablish freedom in this country when the empire falls.

If the dollar goes down and the US can no longer export debt to the world through the dollar reserve system, the US government will no longer have the ability to micromanage the lives of American citizens. They will not have the resources (you have to have a lot of excess money to inflict your will on the entire population, which is one reason why people are so much freer in third world countries). We will be free, and we will then be able to return to the natural order in our society, without Jews controlling everything, without trannies, without deadly fake vaccines, without mass immigration, without feminism.

 ISLAMABAD-Pakistan needs to chalk out an effective and feasible plan to preserve its water resources and stop the depletion of underground water, WealthPK reported.

According to an expert, water is one of the basic necessities of life and Pakistan is blessed with an abundance of water resources. However, the country’s water resources are depleting with the passage of time. It is feared that the entire world will face an acute water shortage in the coming years. Saiqa Imran, the deputy director of the Pakistan Council of Research and Water Reservoirs (PCRWR), told WealthPK that the country was feared to face an acute shortage of fresh water. “The quantity of fresh water is quite limited in the country,” she added. According to her, climate change is the primary cause of the depletion of water resources. She said that the shortage of water triggered concerns about the future availability of water for the world’s exponentially rising population.

Saiqa Imran said that in most cases, the water table was constantly going down as a result of the frequent pumping of water from the ground. “With a growing world population, the more we pump water from the ground at a rapid rate, the harder it becomes to get the amount of water we need because we pump the groundwater faster than it can be replenished,” she added. She said that inefficient water distribution and mismanagement were the main causes of the water shortage. “Pakistan has one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems in the world where more than 93% of water is used by the agriculture sector, 5% by the domestic sector and 2% by the industrial sector,” said the expert.

She said that domestic and industrial sectors would use 15% more water by 2025 than their current consumption. She said that the agriculture sector was the biggest user of water as modern irrigation techniques were not adopted in Pakistan but its contribution to the national economy was declining with the passage of time. Saiqa Imran said that the world’s average storage capacity reached 40% but Pakistan could conserve only up to 10% of its annual river water due to insufficient space. “People have turned to use underground water as a result of the shortage of the most essential commodity. The indiscriminate over-pumping in the cities in the absence of regulatory bodies has also led to the depletion of groundwater,” she added.

According to her, there is a dire need to devise a proper pricing mechanism for water usage in any sector. She said that incentives should also be in place to encourage people to use water efficiently. The expert said that the country could take a variety of technical and management measures to conserve water at all levels, reduce irrigation losses, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient irrigation methods by creating a regulatory framework, launch licensing water, and implement integrated water resource management. “Under the principle of private sector participation and optimal water pricing, the policymakers should rethink water policy to encourage wastewater recycling,” Saiqa Imran told WealthPK.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Interview: China's green energy transition inspires countries worldwide: UNDP chief

DUBAI, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China's green energy transitions will contribute to the global fight against climate change and inspire other countries toward green transition, said Achim Steiner, head of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), in a recent interview with Xinhua.

In the interview during the 11th World Governments Summit recently held in Dubai, the UNDP administrator said China's development has been remarkable in so many respects, including poverty alleviation, and its investments in technology and the green transition.

""It is addressing some of the legacies of its rapid industrialization, the air pollution, and the cleaning up of water systems.""

China has made major commitments that it would strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, noted Steiner.

""These transitions will enable China to be both a contributor to a global response to climate change, but also with its technologies and policies will help many other countries including many developing countries to pivot forward into a green transition strategy.""

Also in the interview, Steiner highlighted China as the backbone of the international economic recovery.

His assessment comes as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects global growth to stay at 3.1 percent in 2024 and rise to 3.2 percent in 2025 while forecasting the Chinese economy to expand by 4.6 percent this year.

""The outlook on the global economy is in part also premised on China's own economic development.""

He noted that although there are many factors influencing China's recovery in terms of GDP growth, the Chinese economy is looking positive at the moment and the UNDP remains optimistic that a recovery path is on its way.

UNDP works in about 170 countries and territories, helping to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities and exclusion, and build resilience so countries can sustain progress.

As the UN's development agency, UNDP plays a critical role in helping countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

""We see great potential for our future collaboration in China with the SDGs, including on the SDG innovation hubs that China is establishing and where we are collaborating.""

Asked about his priorities for UNDP in 2024, Steiner said the challenge of climate change remains a centerpiece of UNDP's work.

The 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) is planned to take place in Brazil between Nov. 10 and 21, 2025.

 Russia threatens nukes for US, UK, Finland if NATO expands

Vladimir Putin warned the president of Finland Saturday that any effort to join NATO would “negatively” affect relations between the two countries.

The comments followed another Russian leader’s threat to use the Satan-2 hypersonic nuclear missile to strike Britain and Finland “in just 200 seconds” — and that the weapons could be used to hit the United States as well.

As NATO foreign ministers gathered in Berlin, with discussion about potential applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western military alliance on the agenda, Putin spoke to Finnish leader Sauli Niinisto.

Nijnisto told Putin in the phone conversation that the traditionally non-aligned country “will decide to apply for NATO membership in the coming days.”

Finland and Sweden, also traditionally neutral, are moving toward the applications in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.

Putin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”

Niinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

The exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.

“If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate — to question the existence of this state. This is logical,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. “The Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.”

“If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,” he continued. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA. Well, get in line.”

The Satan-2 is a ballistic missile capable of carrying 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each.

Russia wouldn’t need to move nukes to its European border to carry out its threat, officials boasted.

“We can hit with a Sarmat [known in the West as Satan-2] from Siberia, and even reach the UK,” he said. “And if we strike from Kaliningrad … the hypersonic’s reaching time is 200 seconds – so go ahead, guys.

“On the Finnish border we will have not strategic weapons, but Kinzhal-class, one that will reach Finland in 20 seconds, or even 10 seconds.”

Separately, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said Russia knows that NATO wants to “militarize everything within reach,” Interfax news agency reported.","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Poland Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has convened an emergency meeting of the country’s National Security Council after reports that a Russian missile that hit Polish territory killed two civilians.

The emergency meeting was announced by cabinet spokesman Piotr Muller on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon. Muller did not reveal what the committee was due to discuss and did not offer further comment to Reuters news agency.

The committee talks, which will include senior members of Poland’s government and its intelligence services, come following unverified reports that stray Russian missiles intended for Ukraine have hit a Polish village, killing two civilians.

According to Radio ZET, a Polish commercial radio station, “two stray rockets fell in the village of Przewodów in the Lublin province near the border with Ukraine.”

Russian authorities have denied that the missiles that struck Poland came from Russia.

The station further reported that two people had died at the scene. The Polish military, the police, and the prosecutor’s office have been called to the scene.

Military planes are also understood to have been scrambled.

Polish authorities are yet to confirm media reports that Russian missiles were responsible for the explosion but they were substantiated by a senior U.S. intelligence official to the Associated Press news agency on Tuesday evening.

“The causes of this incident are not known at the moment,” said Marcin Lebiedowicz, a spokesman for the Poviat Fire Brigade in Hrubieszów

“We received a report of an explosion in the drying yard. In fact, upon arrival, we confirm that something like this happened. Two people died on the spot. At the moment, we are securing the scene and lighting the area of the action,” he added.

Kurier Lubelski, a regional Polish news outlet from the affected area has attempted numerous times on Tuesday to verify the details with state officials to no avail.

At 7 p.m. local time, the outlet was told by the local mayor’s office: “I can’t say anything about it. However, there is definitely no need to arouse anxiety. Let’s wait for the exact findings of the services.”

At 7.30 .p.m. local time, the news outlet attempted to speak again with Marcin Lebiedowicz for further information on the incident.

“I’m not allowed to give any information at the moment. I suggest contacting other services,” he replied.

The local police department’s spokesperson has not been available for comment to local media, but Voivode of Lublin Lech Sprawka confirmed he was on his way to the accident site.

Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala stated that “If Poland confirms that the missiles also hit its territory, this will be a further escalation by Russia. We stand firmly behind our EU and NATO ally.”

Latvia’s Deputy Prime Minister Artis Pabriks stated that the “criminal Russian regime” had hit Poland with missiles, although it is unclear what evidence he has to back his statement at this time.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said “every inch of NATO territory must be defended.”

Hungarian government spokesperson, Zolan Kovacs, also confirmed via Twitter that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had convened an emergency meeting of Hungary’s Defense Council for Tuesday evening “in response to missiles hitting the territory of Poland.”

 European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Andreas Mogensen has captured a new image of a red sprite, a rare type of electrical discharge rarely seen from Earth.

As part of the Thor-Davis experiment, Danish astronaut Mogensen heads to the International Space Station's (ISS) Cupola observatory module every Saturday to attempt to photograph storms from above. In the first image released by the experiment, which aims to study intense thunderstorms from a better vantage point as well as weather phenomena in high altitude, a Transient Luminous Event (TLE) is seen between 40 and 80 kilometers (25-50 miles) above the Earth.

TLEs, sometimes called ""sprites"", ""red sprites"", or ""red jellyfish sprites"", have been reported by pilots for decades, but were only recorded for the first time in July 1989. They are rarely seen from the surface, which is probably for the best, given the illusion they create of an invading alien space force.

Like regular lightning strikes, the sprites occur following a build-up of electrical charge within clouds. With red sprites, however, the discharge occurs into the Earth's mesosphere up to 80 kilometers (50 miles) above the Earth. The eerie red color occurs as the charge meets nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere.

Mogensen captured the sprite with an ""event camera"", which according to ESA works more like a human eye than a regular camera, sensing changes in contrast rather than capturing an image. An advantage of these cameras is they can produce around 100,000 images a second, while drawing very little power to do so. Among other aims, the study strives to better understand how lightning in the upper atmosphere affects the concentration of greenhouse gases.

“These images taken by Andreas are fantastic,"" Olivier Chanrion, lead scientist for this experiment, told ESA of this first image from it. ""The Davis camera works well and gives us the high temporal resolution necessary to capture the quick processes in the lightning.""",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
76,EN_CC_100156.txt,"Continual growth: 58 villages now utilizing renewables to grow their economies 

 total of 58 villages across the archipelago are harnessing renewable energy to stimulate economic and social activities in their communities through the Village Energy Independence (DEB) program under Pertamina’s Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility (CSER) umbrella.

The DEB program has expanded as of September to another 11 sites, six of these powered through solar power plants (SPPs) that were installed in collaboration with Pertamina New & Renewable Energy (PNRE), a subsidiary that specializes in new and renewable energy.

The six new DEB locations are: Singapure village in Lahat regency, South Sumatra; Tambakharjo subdistrict in Semarang, Central Java; Eka Jaya subdistrict in Jambi province; Tasikharjo district in Tuban regency, East Java; Larangan village in Cirebon, West Java; and Adat Kedonganan village in Badung, Bali. In addition to infrastructure development, the DEB program also empowers communities in accelerating energy equity by utilizing local energy sources to deliver power to remote villages.

Pertamina vice president corporate communication Fadjar Djoko Santoso said Pertamina would continue to provide access to renewables for all Indonesians so they ultimately achieved energy and economic self-reliance.

""We are continuing our journey to provide opportunities and accelerate the energy transition for the public, such as through the DEB program, which can be beneficial in stimulating economic activity,"" Fadjar said.

Tasikharjo village is one tangible example of Pertamina’s support for local economies through the DEB program. The village is using solar energy to power local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), such as Batik Sekar Tanjung, Jahit Sekar Tanjung and Ethical Creative Tasikharjo.

Meanwhile, Tambakharjo subdistrict is using solar photovoltaic (PV) panels to power the activities of the Pujasera Energy Culinary Kampung.

Solar energy is also being harnessed to support a variety of activities in Kedonganan village that impact the region’s community-based economy, including the operation of its reduce, reuse, recycle waste management facility (TPS3R).

Solar PV panels is also used to generate renewable energy in the villages of Eka Jaya, Larangan and Singapure to support the activities of aquaponics, aquaculture and agriculture MSMEs, including a coffee farm, as well as other MSMEs that stimulate economic and social development.

""The use of renewable and environmentally friendly energy, which never runs out, greatly enhances the productivity of coffee bean processing and other business production, early childhood schools and other public institutions, such as Posyandu [integrated health services posts],” said Singapure village head Aristo Hasan.

“This improves the quality of life for residents of Singapure village and also broadens our understanding of environmentally friendly, renewable energy that can help the government mitigate climate change,"" Aristo added.

Since Pertamina launched the DEB program in 2019, the program has generated benefits that include 170,880 watt-peak (Wp) of solar energy, 605,000 cubic meters per year of biogas and methane, 8,000 Wp of microhydropower, 6,500 liters of biodiesel per year and 16,500 Wp of solar-wind hybrid energy.

In addition to its energy impact, the DEB program has also positively impacted 3,201 households, contributing to an estimate of Rp 1.8 billion in added value per year through overall multiplier effect. The program has also contributed to reducing carbon emissions by 565,928 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) per year.

As part of Pertamina’s CSER initiative, the DEB program supports the company's environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) principles. The program is also in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in achieving SDG 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth, and SDG 13 on Climate Action.

Moreover, the DEB program is a concrete action Pertamina is taking to contribute to the government's 2060 net zero emissions goal.

 by Mac Slavo, SHTF Plan:

Russia is preparing for a war with NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the West. The preparations are for a “long-term confrontation”.

A growing number of Western rulers have also warned of a military threat from Russia to countries along the eastern flank of NATO, calling for Europe to get prepared by rearming.

The chief of the intelligence service said the assessment was based on Russian plans to double the number of forces stationed along its border with NATO members Finland and the Baltic States of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. “Russia has chosen a path which is a long-term confrontation … and the Kremlin is probably anticipating a possible conflict with NATO within the next decade or so,” Kaupo Rosin told reporters at the release of Estonia’s national security threats report, according to a report by The New York Post.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Rosin claimed that a military attack by Russia is “highly unlikely” in the short term, partly because Russia has to keep troops in Ukraine, and that would be unlikely if the Russian buildup of forces was matched in Europe. “If we are not prepared, the likelihood (of a military Russian attack) would be much higher than without any preparation,” Rosin added.

Estonia and the other Baltic States have increased their military spending to over 2% of the value of their economies after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and NATO allies have raised their presence in those countries.

Germany plans to have 4,800 combat-ready troops in the region by 2027, in its first permanent foreign deployment since World War Two, and Rosin said NATO and its allies were moving in the right direction to counter the Russian threat. –The New York Post.

Russia has repeatedly warned that it will go to war with NATO if the West’s weapons defeat Russia, or lethal aid is sent to Ukraine. One could argue that the West has crossed that line, but Russia has yet to follow through with an attack on NATO.

Russia Warns NATO A Nuclear War Will Ensue If Western Weapons Defeat Russia

The bad news is that Russia’s ability to provide ammunition to its troops is continuing to outweigh Ukraine’s. Rosin said that unless Western support is sustained or increased, Ukraine is unlikely to be able to change the situation on the battlefield.","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who visited European countries last week, wanted to make a solidarity visit to Israel alongside U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, but was turned down by Israel.

More stories:

According to sources familiar with the request, Israel informed the Jewish leader that ""it's not the right time"", but he might visit later. Zelensky wishes to express support for Israel, but due to his own constraints - as Ukraine has been under attack from Russia for nearly two years - he cannot make it to Israel on a ""standalone trip"" and is expected to include Israel as part of a future European tour.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian police, spanning its many units including the special forces, crafted a heartfelt tribute to the State of Israel through a video featuring officers from across their ranks.

""The year is 2023. Israel was brutally attacked by terrorists. During the attack, hundreds of civilians, military personnel, including police officers were killed,” members of the Patrol Police of Ukraine say in the video.

“Patrol officers express their deepest respect and gratitude to police and military officers of Israel. To those who were the first to join the battle and became the adamant defenders of their citizens.

“We are deeply saddened by the deaths and losses that Israel has suffered as a result of this brutal aggression. The Patrol Police of Ukraine stands side by side with Israel at this important moment. And we express our most sincere solidarity to all police and military families of Israel.

 Putin Deploys Troops Along Finland Border In Response To NATO Accession

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in fresh remarks that Finland and Sweden’s entry into NATO are ""a meaningless step"" but that in response Moscow will still deploy troops and ""systems of destruction"" to the Finnish border after Finland joined the alliance.

""Frankly speaking, I don’t understand why they need this. This is an absolutely meaningless step from the point of view of ensuring their own national interests,"" Putin said.

""We generally had ideal relations with Finland, simply ideal. We did not have a single claim against each other, especially territorial ones,"" Putin continued, before saying that Finland's NATO accession was really born out of a desire to ""join the Western club"".

""We didn't even have troops; we removed all the troops from there, from the Russian-Finnish border,"" he said. ""However, it is up to them to decide. That's what they decided. But we didn't have troops there, now we will.""

Finland became the 31st member of the alliance last April, but it was on Monday that Sweden formally became the 32nd at a flag raising ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels.

""The Russian, brutal, full-scale invasion against Ukraine united Sweden behind the conclusion that a full-fledged NATO membership is the only reasonable choice,"" Kristersson said.

 The Eurocrats Fear That Fico's Attempted Assassination Will Influence Next Month's Elections

Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned last week that Russia will ramp up its meddling ahead of next month’s parliamentary elections, which preceded European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova assessing that they’d be a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience. This speculation is nothing new, but what’s different this time around is that the attempted assassination of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be on every voter’s mind, thus likely influencing the outcome.

The preceding hyperlinked analysis argued that fake news was responsible for radicalizing the pro-Ukrainian suspect into thinking that shooting his premier was a legitimate form of protest against what he’d been misled by the media into believing was his “pro-Russian dictator with blood on his hands”. This black swan event might have served the short-term interests of that leader’s many enemies, but the blowback could be considerable if it leads to a conservative landslide during next month’s elections.

Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban predicted that the upcoming vote will influence the direction of war and peace in Europe, and while the European Parliament admittedly can’t do much in terms of shaping the NATO-Russian proxy war in Ukraine, it could still exert positive pressure if conservatives win. It’s with that in mind that Eurocrats like von der Leyen and Jourova are fearmongering about Russian meddling since they want to preemptively discredit this potential outcome.

To be sure, the first of those two had no idea that an assassination attempt would be made against Fico the day after she shared her earlier mentioned warning, but the second’s assessment about the upcoming elections being a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience came some days later. Instead of speaking vaguely about alleged Russian meddling, the Eurocrats are now honing their information warfare narrative to muddle the conversation about Fico’s attempted assassination and its political aftermath.

The targeted audience is the unclear number of on-the-fence voters who might usually lean liberal but have recently begun to sympathize with some conservative positions on issues like Ukraine. Last week’s incident was driven by the liberal media’s fake news about the Slovak leader, which might influence some of these voters to give the more narratively responsible conservatives their support. In an attempt to desperately prevent this, the Eurocrats want them think that it would be doing Russia’s bidding.

If the European Parliamentary elections have absolutely no effect on anything, then they wouldn’t care who votes for whom, but the outcome will clearly at the very least have a major impact on popular perceptions and could lead to cascading consequences like more anti-war protests across the bloc. It’s for this reason that the Eurocrats and their media allies, including those being promoted by state-run Ukrainian outlets like this one here, are pushing the abovementioned information warfare narrative.

The growing gap between liberals and conservatives over Ukraine, which is foreign policy issue that Fico was most closely associated with, is naturally occurring as a result of their polar opposite worldviews and not due to Russian meddling. It’s so emotive and significant that some from both sides have become single-issue voters who’ll cast their ballots purely based on candidates’ positions towards this. Attempting to discredit this trend as being due to Russian meddling is disrespectful to democracy.","['URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Distrust towards Media']","['URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Ukrainian media cannot be trusted']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
81,EN_UA_017310.txt,"Jake Sullivan hints US won’t replenish controversial cluster munitions to Ukraine 

 The Biden administration has no plans to replenish the stockpile of controversial cluster bombs it’s sending to Ukraine, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.

“Our current plan is not to replenish that stockpile,” Sullivan told NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” .

“It is rather to build up the capacity to produce the unitary round of the 155, the non-cluster munition round of ammunition,” he said.

Earlier this month, President Biden opted to send the divisive ammunition to Ukraine — and publicly acknowledged he was prompted to do so because the military is running low on 155 mm artillery ammunition rounds.

A chorus of critics — both abroad and at home — decried the decision, citing the grave dangers cluster munitions pose to civilians given their dud rates.

Sullivan echoed Biden’s defense — that the US must supply Ukraine with adequate firepower.

“We began that process months ago was we anticipated the need for continuing supply Ukraine, but it takes time and that is why we need a bridge from today,” he said, referencing steps to boost production of 155 mm rounds.

“We need to ensure that Ukraine has the necessary supply of ammunition to a few months down the road, when we believe we can supply enough of the unitary round to meet Ukraine’s defense needs.”

Cluster bombs are prohibited by over 100 countries across the world, including multiple NATO members.

Military officials claim the cluster bombs being sent to Ukraine have a dud rate of around 2.35% or less — markedly lower than the roughly 30% and 40% dud rate estimated for Russia’s cluster munitions being deployed against Ukraine.

The dud rate refers to the likelihood of the bomblets in the cluster munitions not exploding after being deployed.

Bomblets that are duds may detonate long after being deployed.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin previously committed to having the US help Ukraine scour and clean up duds from those munitions.

Sullivan insisted dissemination of the controversial bombs doesn’t undercut US’ “moral authority.”

“Our moral authority and Ukraine’s moral authority in this conflict comes from the fact that we are supporting a country under brutal, vicious attack by its neighbor with missiles and bombs raining down in its cities, killing its civilians, destroying its schools, it’s churches, its hospitals,” he said.

“The idea that providing Ukraine with a weapon in order for them to be able to defend their homeland, protect their civilians is somehow a challenge for moral authority I find questionable,” he added.

Last week, NATO held a summit in Vilinius, lithuania, and ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit there, he slammed NATO allies for their position on admitting the war-torn nation into the powerful alliance.

Sullivan reiterated the US position that Ukraine can receive admittance once it wraps up the necessary reforms to meet the alliance’s democracy requirements.

“We could have said it more clearly,” Sullivan said, alluding to a NATO communique. “Ukraine’s future will be in NATO. Period full stop. That was a single, clear sentence. It’s not subject to negotiation from any country, including Russia.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
82,EN_UA_103403.txt,"Russia Stages Major Airstrike on Ukraine; One Missile Enters Polish Airspace 

 KYIV—Russia struck critical infrastructure in Ukraine’s western region of Lviv with missiles early on March 24, Kyiv said, in a major airstrike that saw one Russian cruise missile briefly fly into Polish airspace, according to Warsaw.

Moscow launched 57 missiles and drones in the attack that also targeted Kyiv, two days after the largest aerial bombardment of Ukraine’s energy system in more than two years of full-scale war, Kyiv said.

“There were two preliminary hits on the same critical infrastructure facility that the occupiers targeted at night,” Lviv’s regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

The strike used Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, which are harder to shoot down, he added, without identifying the facility.

The energy ministry said equipment caught fire when a critical energy facility in the Lviv region was attacked, causing it to lose power. It was unclear whether they were talking about the same facility.

Air defences destroyed 18 of 29 inbound missiles and 25 of 28 attack drones, the Ukranian air force said.

There were almost no details about what had been damaged, but the targeting of critical infrastructure could indicate that Russia is trying to keep up pressure on the energy system after its strikes caused widespread blackouts on March 22.

The energy ministry said that Ukraine, which has been exporting power in recent weeks, had sharply increased imports of electricity and stopped exports on March 24 after attacks on the energy system.

Several explosions rang out in Kyiv in the early hours as air defences destroyed about a dozen missiles over the capital and in its vicinity, according to Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration.

There was only minor damage from the attack, he said.

Small groups of people huddled for safety underground in a central Kyiv metro station in the early hours, some of them sleeping on camping mats.

Moscow has been pounding Ukraine for days in attacks portrayed by Moscow as revenge for Ukrainian attacks that were conducted during Russia’s presidential election.

The wreckage of a downed Kh-55 cruise missile was found in a Kyiv park, officials said.

“For the third pre-dawn morning this week, all of Ukraine is under an air alert and has been advised to seek shelter,” U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink posted on social media platform X.

Polish AirspacePoland’s armed forces said a Russian cruise missile launched at the region of Lviv had violated Poland’s airspace.

“The object entered Polish space near the town of Oserdow [Lublin Voivodeship] and stayed there for 39 seconds,” it said on X. “During the entire flight, it was observed by military radar systems.”

 U.S., Europe plan for any cutoff of Russian natural gas over Ukraine crisis

U.S. and European officials are coordinating with natural gas suppliers around the globe to cushion the impact if Russia were to cut off energy supplies in the conflict over Ukraine, Biden administration officials say.

The U.S. and its European allies have promised punishing economic and political sanctions if Russia moves its military into Ukraine, but worry about repercussions for Europeans from any such sanctions, including Russia potentially cutting off delivery of its natural gas to Europe at the height of winter.

Putin has deployed roughly 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border for weeks, sparking a diplomatic crisis for Europe and the United States. He denies any intention of invasion.

Any U.S. and European measures against Russia in the event of an invasion “also have consequences for others, including us,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in remarks as part of a lecture series Monday night.

“There’s a cost imposed on everyone,” Blinken said. “But we have done a tremendous amount of work to mitigate any effects of sanctions on those ... imposing them, as well as any retaliatory action that Russia might take.”

Two senior U.S. administration officials separately briefed reporters Tuesday about efforts by Biden’s national security team to deal with any knock-on effects from sanctions. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deliberations.

Western embassies are also moving some of their staff out of Kyiv

If needed, Europe would look to natural gas supplies in North Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the United States. The effort would require “rather smaller volumes from a multitude of sources” to make up for a Russian cutoff, according to one of the officials.

The Biden administration has acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin has high tolerance for the damage to Russia’s economy that would come with sanctions. But officials said the “start high, stay high” approach to penalties that they have told Moscow they would take could influence Putin’s calculations.

One official said sanctions could spur inflation in Russia “in the mid-teens” and even, according to the second official, a deep recession that would not help Putin “win hearts and minds” among his compatriots.

In the U.S., a group representing large industrial energy users and manufacturers that oppose export of U.S. natural gas appeared open to considering an exception for helping Europeans weather any possible cutoff of Russian natural gas.

Ukraine’s leaders are seeking to reassure their jittery citizens that an invasion from neighboring Russia is not imminent, despite a troop buildup.

The group, Industrial Energy Consumers of America, has asked Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to limit exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Surging U.S. exports have helped drive up natural gas prices, the group argues.

Paul Cicio, the group’s president, told reporters on Tuesday that his group had not taken a position on how the U.S. should respond to tensions between Russia and Europe over natural gas.

“My own personal view is that if Europe needs gas, the U.S. should be there to supply our allies,″ Cicio said, noting that China is the top recipient of U.S. gas exports.

“Do we have capacity to supply our allies? Absolutely,″ Cicio said. “But maybe we don’t have capacity to ship to China. So we need to be sensitive to the political crisis. It’s a real serious thing.”",['URW: Negative Consequences for the West'],['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
84,EN_UA_102655.txt,"BIOWARFARE ON AMERICANS: RFK Jr. says CIA was directly involved in funding COVID research for Wuhan lab 

 by Ethan Huff, Natural News:

The reason why the Biden regime could not care less about even attempting to punish communist China for covering up the “lab leak” that many believe occurred at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, allowing the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to escape, is because doing so would expose the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its bioweapons program.

These and other statements were made by 2024 presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a recent interview with Fox News‘ Jesse Watters. Kennedy suggested that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is also involved in funding the bioweapons programs from which COVID appears to have originated.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

“I think the CIA was involved certainly in this research,” Kennedy told Watters and viewers. “They were funding it through USAID. And NIH, I think, in the end gave about $26 million in funding to the Wuhan lab. But USAID, which was functioning as the CIA surrogate, gave over $64 million. The Pentagon also gave a lot of money.”

Kennedy would go on in the interview to blast Tony Fauci, the former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), for his complicity in unleashing hell on the world that resulted in tens of millions of needless deaths.

“I think he caused a lot of injury,” Kennedy, who wrote an entire book about the subject, said of Fauci. “I think that he particularly, by withholding early treatment from Americans, we racked up the highest death count in the world. We only have 4.2 percent of the globe’s population but we had 16 percent of the COVID deaths in this country and that was from bad policy.”

RFK Jr. says vaccines do, in fact, cause autism

Unlike the United States, many other countries allowed their citizens to access tried-and-true remedies for coronaviruses such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), both of which were maligned or even banned in the U.S. as “fake news.”

“There were countries that did the opposite of what we did that provided ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, other early treatments to their population, and had 1/200th of our death rate,” Kennedy said.

Concerning the subject of vaccines, Kennedy clarified for Watters and viewers his longtime position that poison jabs do, in fact, cause autism – though that does not necessarily mean that he opposes vaccines being legal, just so long as sound science is able to back them.

“I do believe that autism comes from vaccines,” Kennedy revealed. “But I think most of the things people believe about my opinions about vaccines are wrong. I, you know, all I have said about vaccines is we should have good science.”

“We should have the same kind of testing, placebo-controlled trials that we have for every other medication. Vaccines are exempt from pre-licensing placebo-controlled trials. There’s no way that anybody can tell the risk profile of those products or even the relative benefits of those products before they’re mandated, and we should have that kind of testing.”

Be sure to watch the interview with Kennedy below:

One commenter noted that he agrees with Kennedy in that COVID was “cultivated” and “intentionally released at just the right time, one year before a U.S. presidential election.”

“It was perfect timing for Biden’s campaign to use it against Trump while they were working hard in the background to hide all of Biden’s corruption,” this person added. “I think they are also funding labs in Ukraine as well. That and NATO membership is one of the biggest reasons Russia invaded.”",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A FORMER football star has joined an army unit of Russian hooligans on the frontline in Ukraine.

It comes as the battalion - led by an ultra dubbed The Spaniard - steps up recruitment in a desperate bid to boost ranks as Russian invaders continue to meet stiff Ukrainian resistance.

The brigade, named Espanola, is filled with thugs from the terraces and has now been given special status among armed forces backing Vladimir Putin.

Hooligans were recruited too, but now the unit is classed as a separate private military company, with the go-ahead to expand recruitment.

The ultras are urged: ""Get into the coolest adventures of your life with a real chance to come back alive from these scrapes.”

They are promised a “decent reward” for turning their violent instincts on Ukraine.

More on Russia

Former Russian international footballer Andrey Solomatin, 47, has signed up.

He played for Moscow clubs CSKA and Lokomotiv.

Stanislav Orlov, commander of Española private military company, said: “We were volunteers, then part of the DPR [Donetsk People’s Republic] forces.

“Recently we managed to get separate status. So now we do not belong to any battalions or divisions.""

Most read in Football

Orlov, whose call sign is ""Spaniard"", said they had been given approval to create a separate battalion, Espanola.

The hooligans’ battalion is 550 strong, including 100 operators of kamikaze drones used to attack Ukraine, he said.

The fighters say they are being equipped by football supporters from across Russia.

Orlov said: “There are a huge number of them.

“All over Russia, in fact - in different cities there are different football teams.

“We tell them what we need [and they provide it].""

Five years ago, Putin’s regime desperately tried to crackdown on Russian hooligans and ultras - using an FSB crackdown to stop them ruining the FIFA World Cup, which Putin hosted.

In 2016, Russian hooligans were in pitch battles with English fans at the UEFA Euro tournament in France.

Now they are formalised as an armed force, and seen as heroes.

Espanola is currently recruiting “stormtroopers”, scout-saboteurs, snipers, drone operators, electronic warfare and air defence operators, portable ground reconnaissance station operators, anti-tank guided missile operators, anti aircraft specialists, communications specialists, mechanic-drivers, and medics.

Would-be fighters are told they will “take a quick but deep course of study in all directions with a real opportunity - or rather the need - to become a ‘universal soldier’.”

They will “become a real military man and benefit the Motherland without delay”.

And the stadium fighters will “get access and learn how to work with the most modern weapons, equipment and technologies"".

Sniper detachments “are provided with all the most advanced technologies — this applies to transport, equipment, and of course [guns].”

Recruits are told they “may not be hooligans, but they should be close to us in spirit and comply with the main principles of Española in life”.

Recruitment sessions have been held in Moscow and St Petersburg, as well as other cities.

They boast recruits from the hooligan armies of clubs like CSKA, Zenit, Spartak, Torpedo and Lokomotiv and the notorious Orel Butchers.

Several are known to have died so far in the war, including CSKA Moscow fan Maxim Shmanin, 44.

 Molotov Cocktail Attack On Russian Embassy In Moldova On Last Day Of Election

Sunday is the final day of three days of presidential elections in Russia. Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of deceased opposition activist Alexei Navalny, is urging mass protests against President Putin as he stands of the verge of winning another six year term as president, an outcome quite obvious to all observers. She's calling on Russians to disrupt the final day of voting in what's been dubbed ""noon against Putin"".

While some sporadic minor incidents at polling stations have been reported, there has been a major incident in the small country of Moldova which borders Ukraine. Moldovan police have detained a man who attacked the Russian embassy with two Molotov cocktails as voting was underway there.

""A man threw two containers of flammable substances over the fence of the Russian Embassy in Chisinau,"" police said in a statement. A 54-year-old Moldovan who described himself as also having Russian citizenship was immediately detained after after hurling the Molotov cocktails.

There were no reports of injuries or damage to the embassy, and police said an investigation is ongoing. ""He justified his action by some dissatisfaction he has with the actions of the Russian authorities,"" authorities said.

Moldova has been scene of controversy and friction especially after Russia allowed the opening of several polling stations in breakaway Transnistria, which the Moldovan government has fiercely protested.

Reuters noted days ago that ""A senior official in ex-Soviet Moldova said on Wednesday Moscow was breaking laws by printing ballot papers in the separatist region of Transnistria ahead of this week's Russian presidential election.""

""Moldova's pro-European authorities have already summoned the Russian ambassador to complain about a decision to open six polling stations in the pro-Russian enclave,"" the report continued. ""The central government said the move broke an agreement to allow voting only at a single polling station at the Russian embassy in Chisinau.""

The United States recently become more vocal in defending Moldova's territorial integrity, and has condemned what the Biden administration has called Moscow's 'interference' in the Eastern European nation's sovereignty.

Last summer, Moldova expelled 45 Russian diplomats and embassy staff members from the country ""over numerous unfriendly actions"" as tensions reached near breaking point over the war in neighboring Ukraine and the Transnistria issue. As for Russia's election, Kremlin authorities have said Ukraine is engaged in cross-border attacks on polling stations and in annexed regions of Ukraine.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
87,EN_UA_010735.txt,"Russia's Infrastructure Attacks Could Impact Ukraine's Neighbors: Official 

 Russia's latest attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure could impact the Eastern European nation's neighbors, a key Ukrainian energy official said on Tuesday.

Nearly nine months after Russia invaded Ukraine, Moscow has continued to ramp up its attacks against Ukrainian infrastructure in recent weeks, targeting cities across Ukraine including the capital city of Kyiv.

Despite the vast size of the Russian military, its troops have struggled to achieve substantial gains in Ukraine. Meanwhile, throughout the fall, Kyiv has retaken control of formerly occupied territories, most recently recapturing control of Kherson, a major city in the nation's southern region.

Concerns about attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure have grown as winter approaches, and these attacks threaten to leave millions of Ukrainians without power throughout the winter, which could see dangerously low temperatures.

On Tuesday, Russia hit Ukraine with its latest attack on its infrastructure, which Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko described as the ""most massive shelling"" since the war began on February 24, 2022.

""Today again Russia strikes large-scale missile strikes on energy facilities. This is the most massive shelling of the energy system since the beginning of the war,"" he wrote in a Facebook post. ""This attack can have an impact not only on the energy system of Ukraine, but also on the energy systems of some of our neighbors.""

Galushchenko said the attack hit Ukraine's generators and electricity transmission system, describing the attack as ""another attempt of terrorist revenge"" in which Russia tried to ""inflict maximum damage on our energy system on the eve of winter.""

One Ukrainian neighbor reported outages due to the attack.

Moldovan Minister of Infrastructure and Regional Development Andrei Spînu wrote in a Telegram post that the Russian attacks led to power outages across the country. The lines did not suffer damage due to the attack but were disconnected due to a safety measure.

""As a result of Russia's bombing of the Ukrainian energy system in the last hour, one of the power lines that provide electricity transport for our country was disconnected in automatic mode (automatic load shedding according to frequency). This has led to massive power outages across the country,"" he wrote.

Moldovan authorities restored power for most of its residents later Tuesday, but Spînu warned that Russian attacks against Ukraine could lead to further outages.

""Russian aggression against Ukraine directly affects our country as well. The risks of power outages remain high. Any bombing by Russia against Ukrainian power plants may lead to a repeat of today's situation,"" he wrote.

Newsweek reached out to the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy for comment.

 FACT CHECK: Is NASA Planning To Blast Ice Particles Into The Atmosphere To Fight Climate Change?

A video shared on Facebook claims the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is purportedly planning to inject ice particles into the atmosphere to fight climate change.

Verdict: False

The claim is false. The idea was proposed via a study conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and serves as a collaboration between NOAA and NASA, but has not been put into practice. A NASA spokesperson denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.

Fact Check:

A “fresh group of NASA astronauts” who just completed basic training will participate in the first Boeing Starliner test launch in May, according to Space.com. The launch will be a week-long mission, the outlet reported.

In the Facebook video, an unnamed male claims NASA is purportedly planning to inject ice particles into the atmosphere to fight climate change based on an article from Unilad. The video, which originally stems from TikTok, has garnered over 1,000 views as of writing.

The claim is false, however. The Unilad article, published on Mar. 1, 2024, makes it clear that injecting ice particles into the atmosphere is only a “proposed solution” and has not been put into practice. The article also indicates the proposal is a collaboration between NASA and NOAA and references a recent piece from the Daily Mail that cites a study conducted by NOAA physicist Josh Schwarz.

According to the study, the concept is called intentional stratospheric dehydration and “would involve dispersing small particles (known as ice nuclei) into high altitude regions of the atmosphere that are both very cold and super-saturated in water vapor. These nuclei would increase the formation of ice crystals that otherwise would not have formed.”

“This ‘[ISD]’ strategy would not counteract a large fraction of the forcing from carbon dioxide but may contribute to a portfolio of climate interventions by acting with different time and length scales of impact and risk than other interventions that are already under consideration,” Schwarz and his co-authors wrote in the same study.

Likewise, Check Your Fact found no credible news reports to support the claim. In fact, the opposite is true. Both Lead Stories and USA Today debunked the claim in Mar. 8 and Mar. 15 articles, respectively. (RELATED: No, 80 Percent Of Texas’ ‘Cattle Grazing Land’ Was Not Destroyed By Recent Fires)

Additionally, the claim is neither referenced on NASA’s website nor its verified social media accounts. NOAA also has not publicly commented on the claim.

NASA Spokesperson Allard Beutel denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.

“This is an unfortunate mischaracterization of a study done by another agency. As this was a study, NASA is not planning to inject ice into the stratosphere,” Beutel said.

89,EN_CC_100037.txt,"Majority of Americans Believe ‘Climate Change’ Hoax but Oppose Ending Fossil Fuels 

 Unfortunately, a new poll shows that the majority of Americans believe to some extent the unscientific climate doom propaganda that has been consistently wrong for half a century. The good news: most Americans still oppose ditching fossil fuels and gas cars altogether.

Pew Research Center published the results of its new survey on June 28. While climate alarmists’ predictions have been consistently and wildly wrong for 50 years now, with one unscientific claim after another proven false, the media, government, and institutions continue pounding in the narrative — and with some apparently considerable effects:

- 74% of Americans say they support the country’s participation in international efforts to reduce the effects of climate change.

- 67% of U.S. adults prioritize the development of alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen power over increasing the production of fossil fuel energy sources.

I have previously explained in more detail how “green” energy is actually toxic for the environment, besides being inefficient and unprofitable. In other words, “green” energy is a lose-lose option. Solar panels and wind turbines have killed billions of birds, for instance, and offshore wind turbines can be deadly for whales (not to mention, wind turbines and solar panels generate plenty of toxic waste). And those “green” electric vehicles (EV)? EV batteries, which have to be replaced every few years, are very toxic to manufacture and dispose of.

Perhaps Americans are starting to realize that:

[Pew:] Less than half of the public (40%) favors phasing out the production of gas-powered cars and trucks. Support for this policy is 7 percentage points lower than it was two years ago. And underscoring the strong feelings big changes to American life can engender, 45% say they would feel upset if gas-powered cars were phased out; fewer than half as many (21%) would feel excited.

You mean Americans don’t want to switch to unreliable electric cars that have to depend upon an already strained grid? No way!

If Pew is to be believed, however, Americans are a little too credulous of the narrative that carbon is about to make this planet into a ball of fire. (Spoiler: it isn’t):

- 76% favor providing a tax credit to businesses that develop carbon capture technologies and 70% support taxing corporations based on their carbon emissions.

- 61% favor requiring power plants to eliminate all carbon emissions by the year 2040

One very simple truth that the climate alarmists don’t want you to know is that carbon is absolutely essential for life on Earth. Indeed, increased carbon actually helps plants — including food crops — thrive. Human, plant, or animal, we need carbon. So drastically reducing carbon could hurt humans and devastate crops and plants.

By the way, a recent study found that CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are too low to cause global warming. That seems like important information, but don’t expect to see it in the mainstream media.

It is disappointing that so many Americans believe to some degree in the climate hoax after all these years. But it is encouraging that Americans are not falling hook, line, and sinker for some of the lies around electric vehicles and fossil fuels.

We don’t need to give up our cars to save the planet. It’s all just a political deception.

 The Wagner mercenary group’s head Yevgeny Prigozhin has announced that he will withdraw his troops from Bakhmut by next month and transfer control to the Russian army. The announcement comes just two days after he claimed that the troops have successfully captured the key Ukrainian city.

The claims were however refuted by Kyiv who said that it is hanging on to a corner of the eastern Ukrainian city and that battles are ongoing.

“Wagner will leave Artemovsk from May 25 to June 1,” Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin said in an audio recording on Telegram.

Bakhmut was previously known as Artemovsk to honour a Soviet revolutionary before Ukraine renamed it.

Before planning the transfer of control, Prigozhin readied troops on the western outskirts of the city.

He said, “If the ministry of defence does not have enough personnel, we have thousands of generals.”

Prigozhin has poured scathing criticism on Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and army chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, accusing them of being incompetent and causing Moscow’s large-scale losses in the conflict in Ukraine.

Wagner fighters have spearheaded Russia’s storming of Bakhmut and Prigozhin’s influence has risen hugely during Moscow’s Ukraine offensive.

The Russian military claimed on Saturday that it has successfully captured the much-contested eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.

The Wagner Group led the all-out offensive in the city. Earlier in the day, Prigozhin said that his troops had finally pushed the Ukrainians out of the last built-up area inside the city.

The Russian defence ministry said in a statement, “As a result of offensive actions by Wagner assault units, supported by artillery and aviation of the Southern Group of Forces, the liberation of Artyomovsk has been completed.”

“Vladimir Putin congratulated the assault units of Wagner as well as all servicemen of units of the Russian armed forces who provided them with the necessary support and flank cover, on the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk (the Soviet-era name for Bakhmut),” TASS agency quoted the Kremlin saying.

American Interventionism Is Dangerous,

But Is It Worse than the Alternative?

I’ve been here before, only I didn’t know it. When I born in the summer of 1984, the world had already escaped nuclear holocaust on a number of occasions, but the biggest close calls happened in the early 1980s, with one of them so close to a Soviet-American thermonuclear war that the Soviet officer who de-escalated the event is dubbed “the man that saved the world” – Stanislav Petrov.

Like all incredible lucky stories, Stanislav was called to duty at the last second, because the officer originally assigned to the shift was sick.

Suddenly, his screen was filled with notices of nuclear warheads headed to the Soviet Union from the United States, and he had to decide whether or not to call Moscow ASAP and alert them that in five minutes, the entire country would be obliterated!

But something stopped him… he began reasoning that had the United States started on the path of nuclear war, they’d launch hundreds of missiles, not just a few, and decided to hold off and learn that no other station was reporting anything.

Subsequently, he learned that this was a new satellite detection system that was totally useless, and that even flares from the clouds and sun could make it beep.

Basically, he found out that the latest Soviet air defenses were garbage and was actually fired, instead of hailed for his deep thinking.

I was born the year after Stanislav Petrov saved the world, including my own parents.

Now, the Russians and NATO members are fighting a proxy war in Ukraine. France is ready to send troops to Ukraine already and, instead of having the country join NATO, it will essentially turn Ukraine into a buffer zone between Russia and the rest of Europe, but president Biden, of all people, is the one blocking it.

No wonder precious metals are soaring, but do I agree with hedge fund managers that it is overvalued?

Courtesy: Zerohedge.com

In my opinion, gold is not overvalued, and its fair price is in the neighborhood of $2,582, whereas silver’s is around $37.

In the next few weeks, Biden will realize that France entering Ukraine, while showing that Washington is playing second fiddle to an emerging superpower in Europe. Washington stands to gain much from this, as it will drastically shift from policing the world to coalizing with other nations and keeping its influence, while isolating more and more, which is a very bi-partisan strategy.

If this happens, a head-on confrontation between France and Russia will send the human race back to the WW2 era, and I submit to you that French troops will then be reinforced by German, Polish and Italian ones.

Ukraine, in effect, will be like the Berlin Wall, separating Russia from Europe proper.

If you’re shaking your head in disbelief, just know that during Carter’s term in office, a 40c-worth chip malfunctioned once, prompting the screens to show that 2,000 Soviet warheads were en route to major American cities. Only five minutes later, when Carter was about to be notified and we were minutes away from launching a counterstrike, the operations room called to say it was a faulty chip!!!

Yeah, own silver… it’s going higher.

 Ukraine's Fate Will Be Decided In Coming Year, Top Zelensky Aide Admits

In surprisingly blunt words, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the coming year will essentially decide the fate of Ukraine and its war with Russia.

""A turning point in the war is approaching,"" Andrii Yermak, who serves as chief of staff for the Office of the President of Ukraine, said Monday. ""The next year will be decisive in this regard."" He issued the words while appealing for more urgent aid from Washington in an address to the hawkish DC-based Hudson Institute think tank.

Yermak sought to assure the audience that Zelensky has ""a clear plan"" forward even as Western media has by and large soured on Kiev's prospects for success. Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.

He described advancing plans for ""the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.""

But he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more ""weapons right now""--describing that ""Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.""

Without doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as ""the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.""

So now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the ""bad news"" of late out of Ukraine.

Yermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be ""charity"" but is instead an ""investment"" in America's ""global leadership.""

He further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. ""We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,"" Yermak said.

 NUSA DUA – The European Council president urged global powers Tuesday to intensify pressure on Russia over its war against Ukraine, including Moscow's biggest supporter, China, saying that this week's meeting of the world's largest economies was crucial to stopping Moscow's push ""to use food and energy as weapons.”

Charles Michel, speaking to reporters on the first day of the Group of 20 meeting in Bali, said the nine-month war waged by Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has disrupted lives across the world, as food and energy prices surge and economies stagnate.

“Russia’s war impacts us all, no matter where we live, from Europe to Africa or the Middle East, and the single best way to end the acute crisis in food and energy is for Russia to end this senseless war and to respect the U.N. charter,” Michel said. “The Kremlin has decided to weaponize food, driving up hunger, poverty and instability.”

Europe, Michel said, is working to help Ukraine, a big food exporter before the war, increase its shipments, and is also trying to address disruptions in fertilizer supplies and rising prices. EU sanctions against Russia, he said, don’t target agricultural products, even though Russia has imposed restrictions on its own food and fertilizer products.

“This is not a battle (of) Russia against the Western part of the world. It’s a battle for the U.N. charter. It’s a battle for the international law. It's a battle for the idea that this is not acceptable to try to change by force internationally recognized borders.”

Michel said he had no plans to meet with the most senior Russian present in Bali, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

China, the world's second biggest economy, has largely refrained from public criticism of Russia’s war, although Beijing has avoided direct support of the Russians, such as supplying arms. Michel avoided direct criticism of China when asked if Beijing has shown any signs of changing its steadfast support of Russia in recent days.

Instead, he said that the G-20 meeting Tuesday and Wednesday was important to convince all nations present “to put more pressure on Russia.""

After a meeting Monday between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden said the two leaders discussed Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and “reaffirmed our shared belief” that the use or even the threat of nuclear weapons is “totally unacceptable” — a reference to Moscow’s thinly veiled threats to use atomic weapons as its invasion of Ukraine has faltered.

Michel said that Europe must make sure that it creates a different economic and political relationship with China than the one it did with Russia.

“We don't want to make the same mistakes maybe we make with Russia on fossil fuels,” which Europe was very dependent on, “with China, (where) we don't want to be too dependent for the innovative technology that we need today and that we need more in the future. That's why it's important to rebalance the relationship,” Michel said.",['URW: Overpraising the West'],['URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Putin may ABANDON siege of Kyiv and try to blitz other cities into submission after losing thousands of troops

MAD Vlad Putin may abandon plans to capture Kyiv as countless Russian soldiers would be killed, spooks now believe.

Spies say the death toll of an all-out assault on Ukraine's capital may even be too much for the evil Kremlin tyrant to stomach.

A Western official said: ""An ill-judged ground assault on a city as well prepared as Kyiv, with really determined and committed defenders, would be a fairly costly business.

""And I think there comes a point where even Russia has to count the cost of casualties.

They said Putin's forces were getting ""bogged down"" around the outskirts of Kyiv after suffering ambushes by heroic Ukrainians.

As many as 7,000 Russian troops have been killed in the bloody fighting so far as Putin's battleplan continues to fall apart.

Spies fear the crazed despot could resort to even more brutal firepower that could blow entire cities to smithereens.

A western official said there was ""big concern"" he could create another Grozny, the Chechan city pummelled in the 1990s.

Soldiers fed Putin's lie that they would be welcomed as liberators are struggling to occupy cities because of resistance.

The official said the plan was to ""walk in, decapitate the local leadership and receive the adulation of a welcoming population"".

They added Russia would likely resort to ""brutalise the population"" and ""destroy"" the cities to save face.

Failure to completely capture a single Ukrainian is humiliating Putin who has lost four top generals and has not ""achieved a strategic breakthrough at any point"".

His legendary paratroopers have also been picked off by plucky Ukrainians.

Taras Kuzio, an Associate Research Fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, says dozens of Russian paratroopers were killed in their doomed bid to take Hostomel airport.

95,EN_CC_100235.txt,"Mitigating climate change brings economic benefits 

 Editor's note: Jin Jun is an associate professor at the School of Management, Zhejiang University. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Mitigating climate change fosters a cooperative and symbiotic relationship between carbon neutrality, sustainable economic and social development, which is mainly manifested in the following two aspects.

On the one hand, actions to mitigate climate change and improve the ecological environment can yield direct and indirect economic benefits for socio-economic development. Green and sustainable development can propel the growth of society, from enterprises and businesses to regions and whole nations.

(1) New innovative entrepreneurial opportunities and job positions emerge in response to the need to slow climate change. Innovative entrepreneurship opportunities and employment positions related to carbon neutrality continue to sprout up. For example, as ""carbon"" becomes a strategic asset, enterprises have a substantial demand for professionals in carbon accounting and management, resulting in a surge of new job positions. Relevant technologies and market applications also attract a multitude of innovators and entrepreneurs.

(2) The industrial revolution is evident during the process of mitigating climate change, as emerging industries rapidly develop and gradually replace existing ones. For instance, the swift development of the new energy industry and its supporting sectors in recent years has driven the development of the energy storage industry. Additionally, new energy vehicles are gradually replacing traditional fuel ones, leading to changes in the competition landscape and core technologies of the automotive industry. The application of digital and intelligent technology aids the manufacturing industry in achieving the goal of green transition and carbon neutrality, contributing to the high-end transformation of industries and enterprises.

(3) Emerging strategic resources become crucial for enterprises to attract investment and financing. Green initiatives have become a resource for enterprises to attract investment and financing. ESG(environment, social and governance) ratings have become a crucial indicator of whether companies can obtain financing and loans. Carbon trading will also bring companies new revenue sources. Resources like sunlight, water, and wind have evolved into crucial resource endowments for enterprises and countries. Countries and regions abundant in these new and crucial strategic resources will witness shifts in their domestic and international influences.

(4) Demonstration of international competitiveness and industry leadership is linked to the capacity for green innovation and the ability to achieve carbon neutrality. These factors influence the proactiveness and competitiveness of various organizations and countries in global business activities and international business affairs, as well as their international image and market reputation. These capabilities have become essential tools and means to address regional crises. Companies like CATL and BYD have become industry leaders in the global new energy market. Chinese enterprises have contributed to the sustainable environmental and social development of regions including Asia, Africa, and Latin America, facilitating their development and growth in these regions. Meanwhile, the implementation of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), for example, demonstrates that the ability to reduce carbon emissions will affect enterprises’ import and export costs and international competitiveness.

(5) Improved quality of life for people is a result of environmental protection and improvement, which reduces the adverse impact of harsh environments on health. This, in turn, lowers the demand for medical resources and elevates the overall quality of life, indirectly accelerating socio-economic development.

On the other hand, socio-economic development further promotes innovative entrepreneurial activities that mitigate climate change. Market-driven technological applications propel the iterative upgrading of green technologies, thus driving overall technological innovation. When people benefit from improved ecological environments, they become more receptive to related technologies and innovations, thereby propelling the development of related technological innovations and entrepreneurial activities. Moreover, when companies benefit from improvements in the ecological environment, they enhance their competitiveness and innovative capacity, boosting their ability to innovate related technologies and undertake entrepreneurial activities.

Therefore, the improvement of the ecological environment through mitigating climate change and the green and sustainable development of businesses are mutually influential and complementary, often leading to their coordinated development.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

outheast Asian defence ministers meet in Indonesia alongside key players in the Indo-Pacific this week, with the ASEAN bloc set to reinforce a message of centrality as major powers jostle for influence in the region.

The annual get-together, which starts on Wednesday, comes as conflict rages in the Middle East and Ukraine and as tensions ratchet up in disputed waters in the South China Sea, where China is being accused of aggression against the Philippines, which has US backing and seeks to boost its military ties with Japan.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) chair Indonesia has yet to confirm attendees, but among them is US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who will meet ASEAN counterparts on Wednesday.

The talks will expand on Thursday to include Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, India, New Zealand and Australia.

ASEAN, a region of about 660 million people with a combined gross domestic product of more than $3.2 trillion, has for years been courted by Washington and Beijing, but their fierce rivalry has caused its members concern.

""Competition is good. But competition should not deteriorate into a zero-sum game,"" Defence Minister and presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto told a foreign policy forum this week, where he stressed the importance of non-alignment.

Relations between China and the United States have been frosty after President Joe Biden ordered the shooting down in February of a suspected Chinese spy balloon.

It was unclear who will represent China at the Jakarta meeting after the removal of its defence minister in October, raising questions about the stability of the leadership around President Xi Jinping.

Austin comes to Indonesia from South Korea, where he reiterated concerns about Russia and China helping North Korea to evade sanctions and Moscow's closer military ties with Pyongyang.

Washington has accused North Korea of supplying military equipment to Russia for use in its war with Ukraine, and Moscow of providing technical military support to help the North.

Aaron Connelly, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, said conflict in Gaza and Ukraine and China's moves to block Philippine resupply missions at a disputed reef will most likely feature at the meeting.

""This forum is not one where major geopolitical developments are really addressed or moved forward in any significant way. But we do expect discussions from the US and Philippines on topics like the Second Thomas Shoal, Israel-Hamas, Ukraine,"" Connelly said.

 A 'Watershed Event': Five Takeaways From Israel's Assassination Of Hamas' Political Leader In Tehran

Authored by Andrew Korybko via substack,

Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated by Israel early Wednesday morning in the heart of the Iranian capital hours after attending President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration. The details remain unclear, but it’s widely thought that he was killed by a precision drone strike at his residence. The world is watching to see whether Iran and/or its Resistance Axis allies will respond, what form it could take if so, and whether that would escalate tensions to a wider war.

Here are five takeaways thus far:

1. Israel’s Intelligence & Tactics Are Top-Notch

Israel somehow or another obtained accurate intelligence about Haniyeh’s location despite it being top-secret and was then able to successfully assassinate him. Whatever air defenses (including electronic warfare ones) that Iran had deployed in its capital as part of the security measures to protect its high-profile guests failed to thwart this attack. This is a major embarrassment for the Islamic Republic and prompts speculation about whether it was due to utter incompetence or was partially an inside job.

2. Iran Is Caught In A Dilemma Over How To Respond

It’s unimaginable that Iran won’t respond to its Israeli enemy assassinating a high-profile allied guest in Tehran during the new president’s inauguration, but the dilemma is over the form that this response will take. Launching another drone and missile salvo against Israel like it did in the spring after the bombing of its consulate in Damascus is possible, though Israel could spin that as a failure if many of them are shot down like last time, the on-the-ground damage is minimal, and no high-profile targets are killed.

3. Mutually Assured Destruction Hangs Heavy Over Everyone’s Head

The response that Iran resorts to will be determined by its leadership’s understanding of how far they can go without triggering the “mutually assured destruction” (MAD) scenario, which both Israel and the Resistance Axis fear and is why they’ve thus far restrained themselves from waging all-out war. A repeat of spring’s salvo could remain below that threshold, but Iran might also respond in a different way that’s interpreted by Israel as an escalation, thus prompting its own escalation that could then lead to MAD.

4. A Choreographed Response Might Therefore Be The Most “Rational”…

Duma member Dmitry Belik, whose claim to fame was helping Sevastopol reunify with Russia when he briefly served as the region’s acting head in spring 2014, described spring’s salvo as a “beautiful theatrical production”. If there’s any truth to his innuendo that Iran choreographed its response with the US and/or Israel to Israel’s bombing of its consulate in Syria, then it might also do the same after Haniyeh’s assassination, which could help Iran “save face” while averting an escalation towards MAD.

5. …But There’s No Guarantee That Iran’s Allies Will “Stand Down”

Hamas and Hezbollah are Iran’s allies but operate independently of it despite their close ties. There’s accordingly no guarantee that they’ll “stand down” and not respond in their own way if Iran sends another salvo to Israel regardless of whether or not it’s choreographed. After all, Hamas’ political chief was just killed, while one of Hezbollah’s top commanders was assassinated by Israel in Beirut the day prior. This makes the MAD risk even less manageable since those two might not share Iran’s calculations.

Haniyeh’s assassination is a watershed event in the latest Israeli-Hamas War, which is now a regional Israeli-Iranian proxy war, since it greatly spikes the risk of everything spiraling into MAD.

Iran’s response will be crucial in determining whether or not that happens, but so too will Hamas and Hezbollah’s.

They’ll either “stand down” as Iran responds regardless of whether or not it’s choreographed, participate in a joint response that remains below the MAD threshold, or decide to cross that red line on their own.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 As the world is becoming more and more aware about the dangers of climate change, various countries are trying to embrace the green energy. China is among those nations that are serious about using renewable sources of energy. Norwegian diplomat and former politician, Erik Solheim recently informed via his Twitter handle that the photovoltaic (PV) power plants of China increased their production capacity to 392.61 GW in 2022. Solheim added that the China’s export of PV products grew by 80 per cent to $51.3 billion, and nearly 46 per cent of it went to Europe. He also shared a video clip where hundreds of solar panels can be seen in a solar park.

Export of PV products increased by 80% to US$51.3 billion, about 46% went to Europe, a year-on-year increase of 115%

Wang Bohua, honorary chairman of the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, said that China’s export of solar product exceeded $50 billion for the first time last year, as mentioned in a report by Yicai Global. The export comprised panels worth $42.4 billion, silicon wafers of value $5.1 billion, and batteries amounting to $3.8 billion.

Among the main PV products, the polysilicon production of China jumped 63 per cent to 827,000 tons last year, according to Wang. Wang added that the cell production increased 61 per cent to 318 GW, while panel and wafer production increased by 59 per cent and 58 per cent to 288.7 GW and 357 GW, respectively.

In a recent development, US imports of solar panels have begun to pick up after months of gridlock stemming from the implementation of a new law that bans goods produced with forced labour, as told by two Chinese solar companies to Reuters. A White House official attributed the thaw in shipments to clearer rules for complying with the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act (UFLPA).

The gains come as a relief to major Chinese suppliers like Trina Solar and Jinko Solar. These suppliers are now finally getting products into the lucrative market of United States after long delays. Under the labour protection law, imports of products made in China’s Xinjiang region are prohibited. Chinese authorities have reportedly established labour camps for ethnic Uyghur and other Muslim groups in the Xinjiang region.

 by Jonathan Cook, The Unz Review:

No one but the terminally naïve should be surprised that security services lie – and that they are all but certain to cover their tracks when they carry out operations that either violate domestic or international law or that would be near-universally rejected by their own populations.

Which is reason enough why anyone following the fallout from explosions last September that ripped holes in three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea supplying Russian gas to Europe should be wary of accepting anything Western agencies have to say on the matter.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

In fact, the only thing that Western publics should trust is the consensus among “investigators” that the three simultaneous blasts deep underwater on the pipelines – a fourth charge apparently failed to detonate – were sabotage, not some freak coincidental accident.

Someone blew up the Nord Stream pipelines, creating an untold environmental catastrophe as the pipes leaked huge quantities of methane, a supremely active global-warming gas. It was an act of unrivaled industrial and environmental terrorism.

If Washington had been able to pin the explosions on Russia, as it initially hoped, it would have done so with full vigor. There is nothing Western states would like more than to intensify world fury against Moscow, especially in the context of NATO’s express efforts to “weaken” Russia through a proxy war waged in Ukraine.

But, after the claim made the rounds of front pages for a week or two, the story of Russia destroying its own pipelines was quietly shelved. That was partly because it seemed too difficult to maintain a narrative in which Moscow chose to destroy a critical part of its own energy infrastructure.

Not only did the explosions cause Russia great financial harm – the country’s gas and oil revenues regularly financed nearly half of its annual budget – but the blasts removed Moscow’s chief influence over Germany, which had been until then heavily dependent on Russian gas. The initial media story required the Western public to believe that President Vladimir Putin willingly shot himself in the foot, losing his only leverage over European resolve to impose economic sanctions on his country.

But even more than the complete lack of a Russian motive, Western states knew they would be unable to build a plausible forensic case against Moscow for the Nord Stream blasts.

Instead, with no chance to milk the explosions for propaganda value, official Western interest in explaining what had happened to the Nord Stream pipelines wilted, despite the enormity of the event. That was reflected for months in an almost complete absence of media coverage.

When the matter was raised, it was to argue that separate investigations by Sweden, Germany and Denmark were all drawing a blank. Sweden even refused to share any of its findings with Germany and Denmark, arguing that to do so would harm its “national security.”

No one, again including the Western media, raised an eyebrow or showed a flicker of interest in what might be really going on behind the scenes. Western states and their compliant corporate media seemed quite ready to settle for the conclusion that this was a mystery cocooned in an enigma.

Isolated and friendless

It might have stayed that way forever, except that in February, a journalist – one of the most acclaimed investigative reporters of the past half-century – produced an account that finally demystified the explosions. Drawing on at least one anonymous, highly placed informant, Seymour Hersh pointed the finger for the explosions directly at the US administration and President Joe Biden himself.","['URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
100,EN_UA_103372.txt,"Putin Says US, NATO Ignored Its Security Demands as Kremlin Rules out War in Ukraine 

 The president of Russia said on Friday the United States and its NATO allies have ignored Moscow’s security demands, while a top Kremlin official said Russia does not want a war.

“There won’t be a war as far as it depends on the Russian Federation, we don’t want a war,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during an interview with local radio stations. “But we won’t let our interests be rudely trampled on and ignored.”

During the call, Putin said he wants to continue dialogue with the West to negotiate a stalled peace agreement for eastern Ukraine between Russia, Ukraine, France, and Germany. Presidential envoys from the four countries already met in Paris on Wednesday and agreed to another meeting in Berlin in two weeks.

The latest diplomatic move also comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday called on the West not to create “panic,” challenging U.S. warnings about an imminent Russian attack.

“I don’t consider the situation now tenser than before. There is a feeling abroad that there is war here. That’s not the case,” Zelensky told reporters at a Friday press briefing. “We don’t need this panic,” he added.

Zelensky’s comment comes one day after rumors spread that President Joe Biden warned him during a phone call that Kyiv would soon be “sacked” in an invasion by Russian military forces.

“He has previously said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months. Reports of anything more or different than that are completely false,” she said.

Meanwhile, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko also ruled out that there will be war, saying there will not be a war unless Belarus or Russia comes under attack.

“The leaders of some countries have gone mad, they think they can win that war,” Lukashenko said. “But there will be no victory, we will all lose.”

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told parliament the number of Russian troops near Ukraine—which amounts to about 130,000—is comparable to Moscow’s military buildup last spring, when Moscow eventually pulled its forces back after massive exercises.

“We haven’t observed any events or actions of military character that significantly differ from what was going on last spring,” with the exception of the deployment to Belarus, Reznikov said.

While Moscow and the West are mulling their next steps, NATO said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region, and the United States ordered 8,500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe.

Russia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, and dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic. Russian troops have also headed to Belarus for sweeping joint drills, again raising Western fears that Moscow could stage an attack on Ukraine from the north.",['URW: Amplifying war-related fears'],['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships Ms. Chrysoula Zacharopoulou and ECW Executive Director Yasmine Sherif call on donors and the private sector to urgently provide a total of US$1.5 billion.

NEW YORK, Sept. 23, 2023 At this weekend’s Global Citizen Festival in New York, France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships, Ms. Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, and Education Cannot Wait Executive Director Yasmine Sherif announced €40 million in new, additional funding from the Government of France.

Education Cannot Wait (ECW) has now mobilized US$870 million toward its 2023-2026 Strategic Plan to reach 20 million crisis-impacted children with the safety, hope and opportunity of a quality education.

“Championing global education and emancipation is an absolute priority for France. The message of the Paris Pact for People and the Planet is that we must all take our part to allow each country to alleviate poverty and tackle climate change,” said France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou. “This includes states, which must support development policies with sufficient resources. For this reason, I am particularly pleased to announce, on behalf of France and President Macron, the allocation of €40 million to support ECW’s actions for the 2023-2026 cycle.”

“With this new bold and generous contribution, France shines as an example for others to follow,” said ECW Executive Director Yasmine Sherif. “We call on government donors, philanthropic foundations, and the private sector to follow suit and join our collective efforts to mobilize a total of US$1.5 billion by 2026 to provide quality education to 20 million crisis-affected girls and boys so they can learn, grow and rebuild their societies.”

Globally, around 224 million children are deprived of a quality education due to armed conflicts, forced displacement, climate-induced disasters and other protracted crises. They need urgent support to fulfil their right to a quality, inclusive education.

Together with strategic partners, ECW has already reached close to 9 million girls and boys in some of the harshest crises around the globe.

While donors are stepping up, the funding gap has actually widened in recent years. Humanitarian appeals for education in emergencies have nearly tripled from US$1.1 billion in 2019 to almost US$3 billion at the end of 2022.

Brussels has found yet another way to take hundreds of thousands of euros out of European taxpayers' pockets, and it's evident which member state is controlling the EU bubble.

Another session of the European Parliament is behind us and we are one step closer to a European Green Deal. This is what Joachim Brudzinski, MEP for Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party, said following this week’s EP debate on the energy performance of EU buildings.

In his view, this is just the latest directive that will result in hundreds of thousands of euros being siphoned off by Brussels from the pockets of Polish and European citizens. The directive includes a ban on gas boilers by 2025. „If this is not an example of a particular kind of ecological madness, or even idiocy, then there are other examples of Brussels’s mad ambitions,” the PiS politician said. The directive would also stipulate that all new buildings must be zero emission by 2030. He believes this is ideological madness, best exemplified by the fact that until the war in Ukraine, gas was the so-called „clean energy source” powering Europe’s largest economy. Brudzinski also pointed out that it is clear who controls Brussels and whose will and interests prevail in EU actions.

„As long as Germany had Nord Stream with Russia, gas was fine. When Nord Stream was stopped, suddenly the Germans realised that gas was fossil energy and they were already saying we should move away from gas. And what should we switch to? Heat pumps. Where will these pumps be manufactured? Well, new factories are already mushrooming along the German-Polish border – in Germany, in fact.”

the Polish MEP pointed out.

The vice president of the Law and Justice Party explained that no European funding had been provided to implement the directive.

 Stakeholders at a programme on Sunday said that collaborative strategies and innovation were keys to unlocking Bangladesh’s circular apparel industry for availing a significant opportunity for the country to reduce its environmental impact, improve its economic performance and create social benefits.

The readymade garment sector in Bangladesh is under a transformative journey towards circularity, but embracing circularity also poses certain challenges that must be collectively considered and resolved, they said.

A panel of industry leaders, policymakers and experts in circular economies made the comments at an event titled ‘Switch to Upstream Circularity Dialogue: Pre-consumer Textile Waste in Bangladesh’ at the Amari Hotel in Dhaka on Sunday.

The event was organised under the Switch to Circular Economy Value Chains project (SWITCH2CE), co-funded by the European Union and the government of Finland.

Parliamentary standing committee on the ministry of environment, forest and climate change chairman Saber Hossain Chowdhury was present in the opening session as chief guest.

Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Faruque Hassan spoke at the opening session as special guest.

Deputy head of European Union to Bangladesh delegation mission Bernd Spanier, SWITCH2CE chief technical adviser Mark Draeck, among others, also contributed to the event’s opening session.

Hilde van Duijn, head of Global Value Chains, Circle Economy, also participated in the event and made circular game demonstration.

Faruque Hassan said, ‘Living in a world in our time where climate is most threatened, business as usual is no more an option. In a race to zero emission and resource decoupling, circularity emerges as the “next normal” linking business and sustainable development. For the BGMEA, circularity sits in the core of our values, mission and vision. Our goal is to help conserve the natural eco-system as much as possible via an economic shift from a linear to circular system, while generating greater social and economic values.’

Mark Draeck said, ‘With the support of the European Union and the government of Finland, UNIDO leads the global Switch to Circular Economy Value Chains project.’

‘In Bangladesh, we support the circular transition for the textile and garments industry, by piloting innovative circular solutions in close cooperation with global and national industry leaders, which as BESTSELLER, H&M and their manufacturers,’ he said.

‘These pilots will address acute challenges on new technology, business models and traceability, and will demonstrate the economic opportunity for circular approaches.

104,EN_CC_100009.txt,"Interview: Chinese wisdom aids sustainable development of new World Heritage Site 

 BEIJING, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cultural Landscape of Old Tea Forests of the Jingmai Mountain in Pu'er, southwest China, embodies the wisdom of China's agrarian culture and is an example of positive interaction between people and nature, and of their sustainable development, a Chinese official has said.

Li Qun, deputy minister of culture and tourism and head of the National Cultural Heritage Administration, made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua. The site was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List on Sunday during the extended 45th session of the World Heritage Committee ongoing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

With the addition of this new listing, China's number of UNESCO World Heritage sites has risen to 57. The Cultural Landscape of Old Tea Forests of the Jingmai Mountain in Pu'er is the very first tea-themed world cultural heritage site globally.

On what makes this site stand out and on what sort of cultural insights it offers, Li said the cultural landscape comprises five ancient tea forests, nine traditional villages and three protective forests, which maintain their vitality to this day.

""According to archaeological findings, the cultivation of tea trees in ancient China can be traced back over 6,000 years,"" Li said. ""Subsequently, tea culture and the practice of growing and consuming tea spread from China to neighboring countries and beyond.""

The cultural landscape has resulted in a unique protection system combining government management with grassroots governance, which ensures the protection of cultural and biological diversity and the sustainable use of natural resources, Li said.

This heritage, he said, also demonstrates the unique tradition of the complementary use of natural resources in mountainous environments by many of China's ethnic groups.

Its success in achieving World Heritage Site status is ""a significant achievement in presenting an authentic picture of ancient and modern China to the world,"" the official said.

China plans to implement preservation and management initiatives in five key areas, Li said.

Emphasizing the importance of prioritizing protection and planning ahead, Li highlighted the need for the coordinated planning of protection and management measures for ancient tea forests, villages and traditional residential architecture. Such an approach aims to strike a balance between heritage preservation and development.

Furthermore, China intends to invest in research on core technologies to enhance its monitoring capabilities for ancient tea forests as well as rare flora and rare fauna, and its capabilities for climate change responses.

To promote the sustainable development of its heritage sites, China aims to improve the participation mechanism for locals and other stakeholders. The involvement of local communities, particularly people from younger generations, will be encouraged and guided to contribute to the dissemination of tea culture and the growth of the tea industry.

China will continue to delve into the history of the tea industry, explore the philosophical depth of tea culture, and elucidate the global influence of Chinese tea culture. The country seeks to tap into the value of this heritage and promote its traditional culture further.

The official said that efforts are underway to promote the effective utilization and regulated development of cultural World Heritage Sites, aiming to breathe new life into these invaluable treasures. ■",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A group of UK-based climate activists, called the Tyre Extinguishers, is moving around deflating the tyres of parked SUVs (sports utility vehicles) on roads in an effort to combat global warming.

The group has claimed credit for tyre-deflating operations in American cities including New York City, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, and cities in England, Canada, France, Spain, Germany and Italy among others, according to a report by Fox News.

“Reports coming in of very angry #CarShaggers who are upset they can’t drive their massive tanks around Lisbon. Oh no! Welcome to the fun, Portugal! We will make SUVs history,” the group posted on Twitter along with an image of a Portuguese-language pamphlet the activists left on one of the targeted SUVs.

On their own website, the “Tyre Extinguishers” who believe in guerilla climate activism explain why they are protesting against SUVs. The group’s website has details and instructions on how to quickly deflate tires on parked cars. It also has a template for pamphlets that activists can use during their operations. Once the person deflates the tyres, they leave a document with a headline stating, “ATTENTION - your gas guzzler kills,” on the vehicle’s windshield explaining to its owner why such action was taken.

“You’ll be angry, but don’t take it personally. It’s not you, it’s your car. We did this because driving around in urban areas in your massive vehicle has huge consequences for others,” the pamphlet reads.

Centrica’s grants of £250 to £750 for customers least able to pay their monstrous new gas bills are welcome.

But they still won’t make much of a dent.

No surprise there when the firm is donating only ten per cent of the profits from its British Gas arm.

That’s a negligible fraction of Centrica’s soaring total: £1.34billion in just six months this year.

It can do so much more.

107,EN_UA_021918.txt,"US, China, Israel and others are developing AI killer drones; this poses significant risks 

 by Rhoda Wilson, Expose News:

The Pentagon’s recent developments in AI technology have drawn concern and criticism as they approach the deployment of autonomous AI weapons systems capable of making lethal decisions independently.

The New York Times reports that countries such as the United States, China and Israel are actively working on lethal autonomous weapons empowered by artificial intelligence (“AI”), which can autonomously identify and engage targets.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Critics argue that the use of AI-controlled drones with the ability to autonomously kill humans is a highly alarming development, as it places life-or-death choices on machines with minimal human oversight. Several countries, including Russia, Australia and Israel are opposing efforts by other nations to pass a binding resolution at the United Nations calling for a ban on AI killer drones.

The issue surrounding the deployment of AI weapons has sparked intense debate, with key questions revolving around the role of human agency in the use of force. Austria’s chief negotiator on the matter, Alexander Kmentt, emphasised that this issue is not just a security and legal concern but also an ethical one.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon has revealed plans to deploy swarms of AI-enabled drones as part of their AI weapons programme. These drones, equipped with advanced AI capabilities, are intended to provide the United States with a tactical advantage, countering the numerical superiority of China’s Liberation Army.

US Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks further highlighted the role of AI-controlled drone swarms in reshaping battlefield dynamics, making them harder to plan against, hit and defeat. However, concerns arise regarding human supervision and decision-making capabilities, as some argue that limitations on AI’s autonomy could hinder strategic advantages.

Critics also point to recent incidents where AI drones have been utilised in conflict zones, such as Ukraine’s use of AI-controlled drones during its conflict with Russia. The extent of human casualties caused by these AI drones remains uncertain, raising additional concerns.

 How Putin has amassed a staggering SIX THOUSAND nuclear weapons that could reach UK in 20 minutes

AS sabre rattling goes, it takes some beating.

Vladimir Putin’s thinly-veiled threat to nuke the West and insistence that he is ""not bluffing"" has caused panic across the world.

Since the Cold War started, it has been assumed the threat of “mutually assured destruction” — in which tit-for-tat strikes would destroy both parties — would prevent a nuclear war.

However, in a chilling threat this week, the unhinged Russian leader declared: ""When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will use all the means at our disposal to defend Russia and our people, this is not a bluff.""

With the dictator’s invasion of Ukraine meeting far stiffer resistance than expected and Western governments uniting against it, such desperate — and terrifying — measures appear more likely.

When Putin announced his invasion, he warned the West that it would face “consequences never encountered in your history” if Nato was to interfere militarily.

So, could the nightmare come true? Putin certainly has the hardware for every scenario.

At his disposal are an estimated 5,977 warheads, of which 1,600 are ready to be deployed. This terrifying arsenal can be launched from land, submarines and planes.

They include non-strategic “battlefield” nukes which have a smaller destructive power — and radioactive fallout — and are intended to destroy military capabilities rather than civilian populations. They can be anything from land mines to torpedos.

They have never been used in combat — so far.

Russia also has the more feared strategic nuclear weapons, which can be launched as warheads on powerful long-range missiles.

They include intercontinental ballistic missiles which would take just 20 minutes to get to Britain — and 30 to the US. These strategic weapons, with deliberately terrifying names such as Satan, are designed to wipe out entire cities.

Unleashing such weapons would come with a huge amount of risk for Putin. He knows Nato forces have an equally deadly stockpile, with the US retaining 5,428 warheads alongside the UK’s 225 and France’s 290.

But he may not care about retaliation.

The Russian leader suggested in 2018 he would be willing to see his homeland destroyed in a nuclear conflict.

He said: “If someone decides to annihilate Russia, we have the legal right to respond. Yes, it will be a catastrophe for humanity and for the world. But I’m a citizen of Russia and its head of state.

“Why do we need a world without Russia in it?”

This, though, was clearly a threat to respond in kind if Russia is ever attacked first.

Sam Ashworth-Hayes, of the Henry Jackson Society, told The Sun previously: “I think there is only a risk of escalation if Nato forces did directly become involved in the war in Ukraine.

“The message from Vladimir Putin to the West is to stay out of our business, because we will escalate if you interfere.”

Nato has made it clear it has no intention of intervening militarily in Ukraine. But one Russian analyst speculated Putin might fire a nuclear warning shot our way.

Pavel Felgenhauer, of the independently minded Novaya Gazeta, said: “One option for him is to cut gas supplies to Europe, hoping that will make the Europeans climb down. Another option is to explode a nuclear weapon somewhere over the North Sea between Britain and Denmark — and see what happens.”

And US intelligence spies fear Russia might have an “escalate to de-escalate” policy, which means if they should find themselves in conflict with Nato, they would threaten to use low-yield nukes in order to bring a war to an end.

'CONCERNING'

Many wonder whether the former KGB spymaster has become unhinged enough to risk escalating a conflict in this way.

But one expert believes this could be a ploy. Professor Andrew Wilson, from UCL, said: “Putin is playing a bit on the crazy. The theory goes that if people think I am mad enough to use them then that plays to my advantage.”

However, Mr Ashworth-Hayes thinks use of nukes is unlikely. He said: “It is important for people to stay calm. Tensions are very high, but there is no chance of either side launching nuclear weapons.

 Boris Johnson to demand Putin ‘steps back from the brink’ in showdown talks TONIGHT before flying to Ukraine tomorrow

BORIS Johnson today demanded Vladimir Putin ""steps back from the brink"" of war to avoid a brutal bloodbath in Ukraine.

At showdown talks TONIGHT the PM will warn the sabre-rattling Kremlin strongman he'll be ""bitterly and bloodily resisted"" if he invades.

Russia has marshalled more than 100,000 troops on the border of Ukraine and is poised to march in.

Mr Johnson - who is flying to Ukraine tomorrow said an invasion would be ""an absolute disaster for the world"".

Speaking in Essex, Mr Johnson said: ""What I will say to President Putin, as I have said before, is that I think we really all need to step back from the brink.

""I think Russia needs to step back from the brink.

""I think that an invasion of Ukraine, any incursion into Ukraine beyond the territory that Russia has already taken in 2014 would be an absolute disaster for the world, and above all it would be a disaster for Russia.""

He said that any Russian invasion would be ""bitterly and bloodily resisted"" by the Ukrainian people.

 This aerial photo taken on May 4, 2023 shows a photovoltaic power station of Almaty in Kazakhstan. (Photo by Kalizhan Ospanov/Xinhua)

The BRI has contributed very important green rail corridors in Kenya, Ethiopia, Laos and most recently in Indonesia. Overseas BRI projects have been paying much emphasize on local environmental protection, fostering harmonious development of human and nature.

BEIJING, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- ""On the ten years anniversary we can declare the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) an amazingly successful initiative"", said Erik Solheim, chairman of the Europe-Asia Center, former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Commending the pioneering role of the initiative in promoting employment and alleviating poverty, Solheim said, ""Nearly 150 countries take part in the BRI and benefit from the investments, trade, technology transfer and people to people contact with China.""

Solheim, former Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, highly appreciated the accomplishments of the initiative in advancing sustainable development.

""China has defeated air and water pollution much faster than any other nation,"" he said, referring to China's Zhejiang province as a world leader in river conservation, and the cities of Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shenzhen as among the world's greenest cities. ""This gives China enormous strength in sharing experiences with other nations.""

The BRI, he said, has contributed very important green rail corridors in Kenya, Ethiopia, Laos and most recently in Indonesia. Overseas BRI projects have been paying much emphasize on local environmental protection, fostering harmonious development of human and nature.

Solheim also spoke positively of China's decision to stop building coal plants overseas, which ""coincide with similar developments in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Kenya and many other nations along the BRI.""

""The BRI is progressively greener, with a massive focus on solar, wind, hydro and green transport. In the future, it will be the world's number one vehicle for green investments,"" he said.

Solheim emphasized the need for increased cooperation between Europe and China, which is ""critical for environment protection, global economic development and world peace.""

He criticized the ""de-risking"" narrative as ""decoupling"" in essence, which is ""a stupid and dangerous way of scoring own goals."" Both de-risking and decoupling will lead to impoverishment and escalate the likelihood of conflict, he said.

""We need to find the right balance between competition and cooperation. This demands a strong and open dialogue between Europe and China,"" said the environmental protection expert.

 BAKU, Azerbaijan, April 23. COP29 is an opportunity for Azerbaijan to announce itself to the world as a country taking part in solving global environmental problems, editor of London-based Energy Intelligence Michael Ritchie told Trend.

""During COP29 in November, all eyes will be on Azerbaijan. The event will be attended by tens of thousands of journalists, participants, and delegates. There will also be questions about why the oil and gas producer is taking part in the climate talks. But COP29 follows immediately after this conference in the United Arab Emirates, also a major oil and gas producer. The UK, where I come from, is also an oil and gas producer and has also hosted this conference. COP29 is an opportunity for Azerbaijan to announce itself to the world as a country that is taking part in solving global environmental problems,"" Ritchie said.

According to him, COP29 is crucial to achieve financial goals and to obtain additional funds, possibly from developed countries, for climate finance. It will also lay the groundwork for the next COP30 in Brazil.

To note, Azerbaijan will host the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29) in November this year. The decision was made at the plenary meeting of COP28 held in Dubai on December 11 last year. Within two weeks, Baku, having become the center of the world, will host about 70,000–80,000 foreign guests.

The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is an agreement signed at the Rio Earth Summit in June 1992 to prevent dangerous human interference in the climate system. The acronym COP (Conference of Parties) stands for Conference of Parties, which is the highest legislative body overseeing the implementation of the Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The parties to the convention are 198 countries. Unless the parties have decided otherwise, COP is held annually. The first COP event was held in March 1995 in Germany's Berlin, and its secretariat is located in Bonn.

 Warning US hospitals are ‘most vulnerable to cyber attack that will be more devastating than 9/11’ in wake of Covid

AMERICAN hospitals are most vulnerable to a cyberattack that would be more devastating than the September 11 terror attacks, an expert fears.

Professor Scheherazade Rehman, director of the European Union Research Center (EURC), warned that the healthcare sector has been ""exacerbated"" by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Rehman said financial institutions have upgraded their cyber defenses over the past decade - unlike healthcare.

She told The Sun: ""We don't have anything that the banks are doing in healthcare settings from hospitals to healthcare delivery centers.

""If your card has been hacked, the bank can lock it down and switch the number.

“But you cannot change your blood type, you can’t change if you’ve had cancer, you can’t change your date of birth or your DNA. Healthcare information once hacked is not reversible.

“Simply changing someone’s birthday is enough to disrupt the entire US online health system and fixing it would be very, very difficult.”

The expert said that a potential cyberattack on institutions would be “more crippling” than a terrorist attack.

She added: “9/11 was a shock event. It was traumatic as we had never seen anything like it before.

Most read in Tech

“But, the real disruption to people, companies, and systems of governance is going to be a cyberattack.”

In June 2017, the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force warned in a report that healthcare cybersecurity is in a “critical condition”.

The dossier stated: “Healthcare cybersecurity is a key public health concern that needs immediate and aggressive attention.”

Researchers at the computer hardware company IBM say that healthcare firms on average take around 236 days to detect a data breach, and 93 days to mitigate the damage.

This compares to the average of 207 days to identify and 73 days to contain a cyberattack.

'EASY TARGETS'

And, US hospitals have around 10-15 networked medical devices per bed on average, meaning officials are working to secure machinery that’s easy to breach, according to Wired.

Analysts at the Brookings Institute believe “the fate of healthcare security” depends on whether investments in cybersecurity are made.

They said: “Just as a responsible healthcare professional seeks to identify and treat patients’ underlying chronic conditions before they cause a serious medical emergency, so too must responsible healthcare organizations address vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure to prevent cyberattacks.""

Fears of a potential cyberattack on US institutions are rising amid the crisis in Ukraine.

Department of Homeland Security officials warned that the US is on “heightened alert” for a potential cyberattack from Moscow.

Rehman believes an attack on the US is ""highly likely"" should the crisis in Eastern Europe escalate.

Pentagon officials warned Friday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would result in a ""horrific"" aftermath.

Moscow has amassed around 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border - something which Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he hadn't seen in the past four decades.

Rehman said: “A US response would probably set off what we believe will be the world’s first large-scale cyberwar.

US IN 'WARFARE STATE'

“The Russians have been doing cyber-espionage and pre-positioning operations – meaning they’re setting up vulnerabilities in our infrastructure which means when they’re ready, they can release. It might not necessarily be tomorrow.”

R.P. Eddy, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Ergo, warned that the US is already in a “warfare state” with Moscow, Fox News reports.

He told governors: “What’s Russia’s next move? [It’s] very likely is to increase cyberattacks. It’s an easy move for them.

“We are already in a warfare state right now and we need to be aware of that.”

Jen Easterly, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), warned said officials are taking any ""rippling effects"" of a potential Russian invasion “very seriously”.

 THIS is the astonishing moment a Ukrainian armoured vehicle bravely takes on a vastly more powerful Russian tank in a ferocious firefight - and WINS.

The astounding video filmed from a drone appears to show a Ukrainian BTR-4 raining hell on the invaders' tank in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine.

The BTR-4 appears to unload a volley of rounds from its 30mm cannon causing severe damage to Putin's war machine - despite it having 40mm armour.

Rounds can be seen streaking through the air in the dramatic David and Goliath struggle.

And after pounding what is believed to be a Russian T-72 tank - a ferocious inferno engulfs and then obliterates it leaving the machine in tatters.

The humiliating scenes come despite Putin's battle tanks being fitted with 125mm cannons - more than FOUR TIMES the size of a BTR-4.

Its main gun can fire armour-piercing shells and highly explosive rounds.

It can also launch AT-11 laser guided anti-tank missiles.

But the 44.5 tonne tanks are less mobile and quick to aim than nippy troop carriers like the BTR-4, whose cannons can rapid-fire.

The T-72 and other variants of it has seen extensive use on both sides in the war in the Donbas since 2014 and the Russo-Ukrainian.

It is a family of Soviet/Russian main battle tanks that entered production in 1969.

Latest estimates suggest Putin's savages have now lost an eyewatering 756 battle tanks since the war began on February 24.

That comes alongside estimates that Russia has lost an astonishing 20,000 men in just 50-days of war.

They have also seen 163 planes and 144 helicopters blasted out the sky above war ravaged Ukraine.

Russia's latest military humiliation comes as the Kremlin redeploys forces eastward after a disaster campaign to take the capital Kyiv.

REDEPLOYMENT

Putin is now focusing efforts in the Donbas region which has been gripped by war between government forces and pro-Russian separatists since 2014.

Russia annexed Crimea the same year and recognize the independence of the rebel regions in the Donbas.

Moscow now intends to forge a strategic corridor between Crimea and its own sovereign territory via the Donbas.

It means roads such as the one shown in the video will remain scenes of intense fighting for months to come.

It comes as the Russian military continues to move helicopters and other equipment together for such an effort, according to a senior U.S. defence official.

And worryingly it is likely to insert more ground combat units in the region once it has regrouped after shouldering massive losses.

But it's unclear precisely when Russia will launch a bigger offensive in the Donbas.

It comes as Russia's flagship Moskva was sunk after an extraordinary missile attack by the Ukrainians.

HUMILIATION

The ship - a 40-year-old symbol of Russian military might - was left a smouldering wreck after taking direct hits from two Neptune anti-ship missiles.

The ship later sunk as it was being towed to naval port Sevastopol in Crimea.

First Rank Captain Anton Kuprin, 44, was killed after the ship was hammered by the missiles, according to Kyiv sources.

It has been alleged that only around 50 of the crew are accounted for - having been picked up by a Turkish vessel.

While another 14 were reportedly flown to the port of Sevastopol, leaving around 450 whose fates remain a mystery.

Video from within in Sevastopol overnight shows dozens of cars purportedly belonging to the sailors still parked in the port - suggesting their owners haven't come to collect them.

The sinking of the Soviet-era Moskva in the Black Sea prompted Russia to launch a furious retaliation, later claiming to have blitzed the factory which made the missiles that sunk their prized flagship.

The defence ministry said it had rocketed the 'Vizar' plant on the edge of Kyiv on Thursday night which it says manufactures Neptune anti-ship missiles.

Russian Vladimir Putin, craving bloody revenge for the sinking, then ordered a brutal new bombing campaign promising more strikes against the Ukrainian capital.

In a statement, Russia defence ministry said: ""The number and scale of missile strikes on targets in Kyiv will increase in response to any terrorist attacks or acts of sabotage on Russian territory committed by the Kyiv nationalist regime.""

Strikes later rocked the capital Kyiv on Thursday night, according to Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko.

Social media videos have shown the sky above Kyiv lit up by countless explosions - they appear to be the most serious attacks since Russia retreated from the capital earlier this month.

While blasts were also heard in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk.

 By 0724 GMT, the rouble was 1.4 percent weaker against the dollar at 100.84, passing the 100 threshold for the first time since March 23, 2022.

he rouble slumped to 100 against the dollar on Monday, hitting three figures for the first time in almost 17 months, struggling under the weight of strong foreign exchange demand and Russia's shrinking balance of trade.

By 0724 GMT, the rouble was 1.4 percent weaker against the dollar at 100.84, passing the 100 threshold for the first time since March 23, 2022.

It lost 1.5 percent to trade at 110.44 versus the euro, also a near 17-month low, and shed 1.3 percent against the yuan to 13.87.

The rouble has chartered a turbulent course since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, slumping to a record low of 120 against the dollar in March last year before recovering to a more than seven-year high a few months later, supported by capital controls and surging export revenues.

Russia's central bank has blamed the rouble's weakening on falling export revenues and recovering imports, but a Kremlin aide on Monday said loose monetary policy was to blame, a sign of discord among Russia's monetary authorities.

Brent crude oil LCOc1, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.9% at $86.05 a barrel, not far from a more than seven-month high hit last week.

The rouble, already under pressure amid robust demand for foreign currency and limited supply from exporting firms, has failed to benefit from strong oil prices.

A trader at a large Russian bank told Reuters the market was confused: ""Everyone is ready for the inflow of revenues from expensive oil, but it seems to be hanging somewhere, and our regulators are somehow indifferent, there is nothing to rely on.""

Russian stock indexes were higher.

Getty Center, one of the top attractions in the U.S. West Coast city of Los Angeles, celebrated the annual Indigenous Peoples' Day over the weekend with an expansive family event aimed at highlighting both traditional and contemporary Indigenous perspectives.

The gathering on Saturday was part of Getty's continuous efforts to celebrate Southern California's vibrant Native American cultures. Sitting atop a hill in the Santa Monica Mountains, the Getty Center, a campus of the Getty Museum and other programs of the Getty Trust, took around 1.3 billion U.S. dollars to build and opened in December 1997. It is well known for its architecture, gardens, and bird's-eye views of Los Angeles.

Building on last year's success, where attendees learned about native plant dyes and relished musical performances, this year's event in the museum had a broader scope.

Generous support for this year's celebration came from the Getty Patron Program, which provides funds for exceptional exhibitions at the museum, reflecting the institution's commitment to diversity and inclusion.

""Los Angeles stands on indigenous land. Recognizing Indigenous Peoples' Day is not just about acknowledgment but about understanding, appreciating, and cherishing the cultures that have been here for thousands of years,"" former Los Angeles City Councilman Mitch O'Farrell remarked previously. O'Farrell was the first Native American to serve on the Los Angeles's City Council from 2013 to 2022.

Indigenous Peoples' Day is recognized on the second Monday of October, and its significance has grown over the years as an alternative to Columbus Day.

Rita, a teacher from Compton with Native American ancestry, attended the event with her family. ""It's essential for my children to see their culture celebrated so publicly. This is an educational experience, a cultural revival, and a family day out, all rolled into one.""

All-day activities included a tasting menu curated by culinary anthropologist Claudia Serrato, which offered attendees a chance to savor traditional Mesoamerican flavors like cacao, chia seeds, maíz, and amaranth. Participants also received recipe cards to recreate these delicacies at home.

Luna, inspired by the Alliance of Native American Chefs, attended the tasting event with an eye to learning more ways to develop her own brand of Native American cuisine that fuses her grandmother's cooking with modern flavors.

""I want to celebrate my amazing grandmother, of the Aqua Caliente tribe, who could do wonders with simple traditional ingredients, and encourage others to explore our unique culinary traditions,"" she told Xinhua.

The celebration further comprised a block stamp workshop led by Meztli Projects, where attendees learned about Mexica lifeways using linocut stamps.

""As someone deeply involved in the revival of indigenous arts, this event is a significant step forward,"" stated Carlos Red Feather, an artist from the Pacific Northwest. ""It's not just about the past; it's about the present and future of our art and our communities.""

""I've been attending these celebrations for years, and the shift in narrative is palpable,"" Linda M., a Native American LA resident, told Xinhua. ""We appreciate the efforts of California's leaders to ensure that our voices are heard, our histories acknowledged, and our rights secured.""

The event's broader intent was evident as it also shone light on the pressing challenges faced by Indigenous communities, such as discrimination, disproportionate impacts of climate change, and land rights.

Conversations echoed sentiments expressed by leaders like Alannah Hurley, executive director of United Tribes of Bristol Bay, who emphasized that the community is not merely a historical footnote but remains a crucial and vibrant part of the American fabric.

As the day ended, Mirim S., a student from the University of California, Los Angeles, reflected that ""today was more than a celebration. It was a call to action. We, the younger generation must ensure that the message of diversity and recognition is not confined to a single date but is carried on through our daily lives.""

As Los Angeles and other cities in California and across the United States continue to celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day, attendees expressed the hope that it would pave the way for greater understanding, recognition and collaboration in the future.

 by Prof Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research:

Eight years ago, on 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) was shot down in Eastern Ukraine.

In recent development, A Netherlands Court on November 17, 2022 found the Kremlin responsible for the alleged attack: two Russians and

a separatist Ukrainian” were identified as “guilty of mass murder for their involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17”.

The media has highlighted the downing of MH17 in the context of the war in Ukraine. The Court ruling is fraudulent, based on fabricated evidence.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

***

This background text was prepared in the context of the Kuala Lumpur MH17 Conference entitled MH17: The Quest for Justice, organized by JUST, the PGPF and the CRG in August 2019.

This comprehensive report provides detailed evidence that Russia was not involved in the downing of MH17.

It also confirms the insidious role of Ukraine’s intelligence agency.

****

The underlying objective is to examine the evidence, reveal the truth and uphold the rule of law.

Today, July 29th 2021, our thoughts are with the families of the victims of the Malaysian Airlines MH17 tragedy.

The 2019 Conference was dedicated to the memory of the victims.

It is also a national tragedy for the people of Malaysia. The downing of MH17 with 283 passengers and 15 crew on board, took place barely a few months following the mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 after departing on March 8, 2014 from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing, with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board.

It is worth recalling that immediately after the MH17 plane crash on July 17 2014, prior to the conduct of a preliminary investigation, Secretary of State John Kerry and US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power pointed their finger at Moscow without a shred of evidence. In turn, the allegations directed against Russia were used to justify the imposition of sweeping economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.

According to President Obama (hours after the tragedy):

“… the downing of MH17 should be “a wake-up call” to Europe to get serious about confronting Russia over Ukraine after EU leaders have proved reluctant to impose tought sanctions.” (Telegraph, July 18,2019)

The Wall Street Journal reports (July 18, 2014) that “Obama is getting his wish and Brussels is now weighing new sanctions”:

European governments, jolted by the downing of a passenger plane over eastern Ukraine that killed nearly 300 people, are contemplating a major expansion of sanctions on Russia as early as next week.

European Union leaders decided in recent days to expand the penalties to a broad new category of people and companies. But the apparent shooting down of a plane carrying more than 200 EU citizens has intensified a desire to act quickly and forcefully, including sanctions against oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin.

In Brussels, some diplomats described the incident as a game-changer. “It would have major consequences if it was certain it came from the rebels— major consequences,” said one official. (WSJ, July 18, 2014)

On July 22, 2014, The European Union decided to expand its sanctions blacklist against Moscow including Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.

EU foreign ministers decided to “draw up further broad measures including an arms embargo and financial restrictions on Russian businesses, … following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.” (Guardian, July 22, 2019)

 UK weather maps: Met Office issues yellow warnings over 70mph winds

The fierce winds are accompanied by a surprising change in temperature.

Met Office forecasts strong winds for the north

Crushing waves will slam the UK’s shores while power cuts and travel delays are likely as 70mph batter the country.

The Met Office has placed a yellow weather warning for wind as strong gales are predicted for much of the northeast of the UK. The weather warning covers Highlands & Eilean Siar and Orkney & Shetland in Scotland.

However, some experts predict heavy winds will also hit other coastlines along the UK. The “spell of very windy weather” is likely to lead to “travel disruption”, the weather agency said.

This includes impacting coastal routes and sea fronts with large waves, as well as possible loss of power and other services.

Delays to road, air and ferry transport are also “likely”.

While the worst of the winds will hit along the coast, speeds could still reach a substantial 60mph inland.

The weather warning is in place until 11am, although winds will remain throughout the day for much of the country.

The weather agency said: “Winds will increase quickly towards dawn Saturday across the Northern Isles with gusts generally reaching 50-60mph but with a smaller chance of 70mph gusts. Winds will quickly ease from late morning.”

The winds will accompany slightly warmer temperatures than in recent days. The mercury is likely to reach 13C in Belfast and 12C in Glasgow, both typically in the colder regions of the UK.

However the country is still reeling from the impact of Storm Isha and Storm Jocelyn.

With the ground saturated in various regions, the flood risk remains high.

Nine flood warnings were last night in place across England alone, including an alert for River Ouse in York city centre. The river burst its banks this week.

The closely consecutive storms has been attributed to the recent positions of jetstreams influencing low-pressure systems from the Atlantic. However, weather experts have also explained to Express.co.uk that climate change is likely having an impact on the number and severity of storms.

118,EN_CC_100005.txt,"Climate Crazies Fail in Attempt to Vandalize Another Classic Work of Art 

 Another of the world’s most recognized and most valuable pieces of art was the target of climate-change activists. Climate crazies tried — and failed — to glue themselves to Edvard Munch’s 1893 painting “The Scream” in Oslo on Friday.

It was yet another example of climate change activists using priceless works of art to protest the use of fossil fuels, which climate zealots believe is leading to global warming. In October, climate activists attacked “Girl with a Pearl Earring” by Johannes Vermeer in The Hague. Climate hysterics were also responsible for an attack on Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” and John Constable’s “The Hay Wain” in London over the summer.

The new climate-related vandalism fad seems to have begun with an attack on Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa” in which a climate fanatic feigned a disability in order to get close enough to smear a pastry on the painting.

In addition, “Peach Trees in Blossom” by Van Gogh; “My Heart’s in the Highlands” by Horatio McCulloch; “Tomson’s Aeolian Harp” by J.M.W. Turner; “The Last Supper” by Giampietrino; “Sistine Madonna” by Raphael; and “Haystacks” by Monet have been targeted by climate hysterics since May.

As of yet, none of the artwork has been damaged, due to being protected by glass.

Video of Friday’s attack shows two young climate vandals attempting to glue themselves to the artwork. Police apprehended the hooligans, and reported there was some glue residue on the glass that protects the paintings.

“I scream for people dying,” one of the activists shouted.

“I scream when lawmakers ignore science,” the other shouted.

The Norwegian climate activist group Stopp Oljeletinga, which translates to “Stop Oil Exploration,” claimed responsibility for the attack.

The group demands that the Norwegian government declare “an immediate halt to all further exploration for oil on the Norwegian continental shelf,” and present “a concrete plan for fair adjustment for today’s oil workers.”

A spokesperson for the group claimed that the vandalism was an attempt to “pressure lawmakers into stopping oil exploration.”

“We are campaigning against ‘Scream’ because it is perhaps Norway’s most famous painting,” said Astrid Rem, a spokesperson for Stopp Oljeletinga. “There have been lots of similar actions around Europe. They have managed something that no other action has managed: achieve an extremely large amount of coverage and press.”

But there’s good press and there’s bad press. These crazy antics are of the bad variety.

Norway is one of the world’s top oil exporters and provides oil and natural gas to much of Europe, a continent in the midst of a serious energy crunch brought about partly by the war in Ukraine. Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has severely restricted supplies and has shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which it claims was sabotaged.

Without much-needed Norwegian fossil fuels, Europe could be in for an extremely cold winter.

The art world has acknowledged their concern over the new phenomenon:

“In recent weeks, there have been several attacks on works of art in international museum collections. The activists responsible for them severely underestimate the fragility of these irreplaceable objects, which must be preserved as part of our world cultural heritage,” read a statement signed by approximately one hundred gallery directors and museums.

These climate crazies are apparently willing to allow a continent to freeze this winter over their fears of an over-hyped “problem” peddled by globalists who flew more than 400 carbon-spewing private jets to COP27 in Egypt last week. If they truly believe the hype surrounding climate change, they’re targeting the wrong thing.","['CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement']","['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist']",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A Tesla Owner Just Exposed A Sick Secret About Electric Cars…

The left has been preaching global warming, cooling, climate change, and end-of-the-world nonsense since before many of us were born.

In his book An Inconvenient Truth: The Crisis of Global Warming, Al Gore attempted to persuade everyone that the globe was overheating.

Democrats are always negotiating deals that place the United States at a competitive disadvantage with other countries, some of whom are our foes, such as Communist China.

They manipulate children into doing their bidding by convincing them that they only have a few years to live.

For them, it’s a pretty decent racket. However, there is another viewpoint.

Economic observers have long known that there are no free lunches, and perhaps it’s time that electric-car fans did as well.

Leftists extol Teslas and other electric cars as cure-alls for fossil fuels’ woes – even when it comes to something as simple as their tires – but disregard the tremendous environmental damage these vehicles cause.

Brad Templeton, a Forbes contributor, related a story of his electric car tearing through pricey tires at breakneck speed.

Despite praising the many advantages of electric vehicles over traditional internal combustion engines, Templeton admitted that the requirement for tire replacement at short intervals is an inconvenient downside.

“The doozy was needing new tires at around 28,000 miles,” Temple writes in “Electric Vehicle Maintenance Is Super-Cheap, But The Dark Secret Is Tires” from last month.

“That was too early, far before their rated life.”

“One reason for this was a stupid mistake on my part. In the past, I’ve taken my gasoline cars in for regular service, and they were rotating my tires as needed during this service. Not taking my EV in for service, I never got the rotation done. That not only meant the drive tires of my car wore out faster, it also meant I could not make a warranty claim on them. Lesson learned.”

Electric vehicles do incur charges for what is classified as a repair rather than maintenance. Many Tesla 12v batteries have been reported to fail, albeit most are still under warranty. If you chip a windshield, bang a mirror, or get a car burglary, parts for premium cars are always pricey. He admits that neglecting to rotate the tires properly may have been his fault, but he contends that the added weight of his electric car, along with the necessity for high-efficiency, low-noise tires, meant an expensive purchase was always on the horizon. Apart from that, he characterizes the advantages of owning an electric vehicle as a world of guilt-free driving.

Like Pete Buttigieg, who urged average Americans to buy electric cars to avoid high gas costs while ignoring the $56,000 price tag, which has already proven to be a money trap.

Nonetheless, in light of this revelation, it appears that the tradeoff of electric vehicles – fewer environmental impacts for a higher price – is having the opposite effect.

Regular tread replacement will have an impact on the environment, both because of the fossil fuels required to manufacture them and because wear and tear contribute more harmful microplastics to the environment.

Given that modern tires contain petroleum-based plastics, a car tire requires between 7 and 22 gallons of oil to manufacture, according to a National Geographic article.

Somehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green”? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/iahDDqZRls

Microplastics become embedded in shrimp gills and guts, according to a study conducted by John Weinstein, a professor of physiology at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina.

“Somehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel, and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green?” Author Patrick De Haan wrote of the deadly bargain greenies have made with batteries made from land-scarred processes.

While proponents of electric vehicles argue that they are better for the environment, it is important to remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and environmental costs are rising faster than ever before.

120,EN_CC_100010.txt,"Leveraging Chinese expertise to help Pakistan expedite real estate growth 

 Pakistan’s collaboration with Chinese construction companies offers a unique opportunity to leverage their vast expertise to expedite its infrastructure and real estate development and adopt efficient construction techniques while ensuring high-quality standards and promoting sustainable practices.

Dr. Liaqat Ali Shah, Head of Policy CPEC in the Centre of Excellence for CPEC, said this while talking to WealthPK.

“The Chinese investment under the CPEC is mainly focused on infrastructure. The largest part went into setting up power generation plants, railway tracks, and building highway infrastructure. The CPEC's western alignment was also the focus of new infrastructure projects, which connected Pakistan's most underdeveloped regions with Gwadar and major urban centres.”

“Owing to China’s rapid urbanization in the last two decades, Chinese construction companies have had a lot of exposure to efficient construction techniques, which has given them a lot of expertise in these fields,” he said.

“Collaborating with Chinese construction firms allows Pakistan to benefit from these high-quality standards, contributing to the construction of a durable and resilient infrastructure. This is particularly crucial in regions prone to natural disasters, as the expertise garnered from the Chinese practices can help in designing and constructing buildings that can withstand various environmental challenges,” he opined.

“As the world collectively embraces the imperative of sustainable development, the Pak-China partnership aligns seamlessly with these global goals. Both nations recognize the importance of environment-friendly construction practices and adoption of green building materials.”

“Through joint research initiatives and knowledge-sharing, the collaboration will be instrumental in achieving the targets related to climate action and responsible consumption and production.”

“Implementing focused training programs and knowledge-sharing initiatives is crucial for cultivating a skilled and competitive construction workforce in Pakistan,” he suggested.

He further informed WealthPK that more than 5,000 trained and experienced Chinese engineers and workers and more than 2,000 Pakistani engineers and workers were involved in different projects under the CPEC.

According to the SBP Annual Report 2023, the construction industry recorded a contraction of 5.5 percent in FY23, after registering a moderate growth in the previous two years. Increase in input prices and wages, higher borrowing costs, and slower growth in development spending are the main factors which constrained the construction activity during FY23.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
121,EN_CC_100038.txt,"The Fed’s Climate Studies Are Full Of Hot Air 

 The Federal Reserve’s credibility is in tatters.

It predicted low inflation through 2021 even as the money supply exploded and higher inflation followed. To catch up, it quickly raised interest rates, stressing many banks, and Fed examiners failed to act before depositors noticed that Silicon Valley Bank was insolvent.

The result was bank runs and panic. But instead of lowering inflation and preventing recession, many of the Fed’s 400 economists are busy fighting climate change. [emphasis, links added]

Examples of climate activism abound.

This year the Fed is forcing big banks to produce complex reports on their climate vulnerability in a “pilot project” that is sure to expand and might lead to lending restrictions.

A query of the Fed’s listing of recent publications returns hundreds of research papers, press releases, and policy statements related to climate change. The San Francisco Fed hosted a conference on climate change in May, in which 27 Fed economists participated.

With all this effort, one might hope the Fed would produce high-quality research on climate change. But I took a close look at two Fed studies on the subject and found shockingly poor analysis.

These studies on the effect of temperature on U.S. and world economic growth are cited without a hint of skepticism and widely lavished with media attention. I’ve managed to debunk both.

In the September issue of Econ Journal Watch, I discredited a paper from the Richmond Fed claiming that warming reduces economic growth in the U.S.

I showed that the paper had serious problems with its statistical reasoning and robustness. My analysis concluded that the data used in the paper showed no meaningful relationship between temperatures and growth.

More recently I published a critique of a study from the Federal Reserve Board claiming that a year of above-normal temperatures in countries around the world makes economic contraction more likely.

The original study used sophisticated statistical techniques but failed to report that its primary finding was statistically insignificant. My request to the study’s author for computer code to reproduce the paper’s results went unanswered.

I managed to write the code from scratch and exactly replicate the results, allowing me to run additional tests that the author didn’t report.

The author’s primary result—that temperature has a bigger effect in bad than in good economic times—turned out to be statistically insignificant. Additional analysis showed that there is no reliable effect of temperature on growth at all.

There are two main reasons why the Fed study appeared at first to show a statistically significant effect of temperatures on economic growth. First, each country in the sample had equal weight in the analysis.

China had the same weight as St. Vincent though China’s population is 13,000 times as large. Equal weighting means that some small countries with unusual histories of economic growth greatly influenced the results.

The paper’s results disappeared when countries like Rwanda and Equatorial Guinea—which had economic catastrophes and bonanzas unrelated to climate change—were omitted.

Omitting similar countries representing less than 1% of the world’s gross domestic product was enough to eliminate the paper’s result. The complicated statistical techniques used in the Fed study magnified the influence of these unusual countries.

There’s a second reason why the Fed study appears to find that temperature affects growth: Many poor countries have warm climates.

A warm climate doesn’t preclude economic growth, as is demonstrated by Florida, Arizona, Taiwan, Singapore, and several Persian Gulf states. But the average poor country is warmer than the average rich country.

Debate continues as to whether this correlation is random or causal, but the hypothesis of the Fed paper is that year-to-year increases in temperature reduce annual economic growth.

The paper claims that its method controls for long-term differences in climate, but using simulated data I found that the Fed paper’s method can be fooled into finding an effect that doesn’t exist.

The only thing to learn from the Fed’s research is that climate propaganda is spreading fast, and when it comes to climate, academic economists are no more deserving of trust than are other supposed scientists and experts.

The Fed’s time would be better spent on more urgent matters, like improving its botched regulation of the banking system.

 The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Western sanctions on Moscow, have sent energy and food prices soaring in recent weeks, while rising natural gas prices also have impacted fertilizer production, which in turn hurts farmers.

ajor international organizations issued an appeal Wednesday for urgent measures to deal with rising food insecurity in poor countries, including financing to support farmers and increase food supplies.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Western sanctions on Moscow, have sent energy and food prices soaring in recent weeks, while rising natural gas prices also have impacted fertilizer production, which in turn hurts farmers.

""It is critical to quickly provide support for food insecure countries in a coordinated manner,"" the heads of the IMF, World Bank, World Trade Organization and UN World Food Program said in a joint statement.

Protests have erupted in some countries over high prices, and the statement said, ""The increase in food prices and supply shocks can fuel social tensions in many of the affected countries, especially those that are already fragile or affected by conflict.""

The organizations called on the international community to provide financing for emergency food supplies, a safety net for poor families and farmers, and to increase agricultural production.

They also called for ""open trade"" that avoids export restrictions or ""humanitarian food purchases.""

While the poor nations are most vulnerable to the crisis, middle income countries increasingly are at risk, the statement said.

""Surging fertilizer prices along with significant cuts in global supplies have important implications for food production in most countries, including major producers and exporters, who rely heavily on fertilizer imports,"" they said.

IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva, World Bank President David Malpass, WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and WFP director David Beasley issued the statement before next week's meeting of the IMF and World Bank.

Increased fragility

The war in Ukraine came as the global economy was trying to right itself following the COVID-19 pandemic, while navigating supply chain snarls that created shortages and a surge in inflation.

New lockdowns in China have added further uncertainty to the recovery.

Ukraine is a key source of grain while Russia is a major producer of energy and fertilizer needed for agriculture.

Protestors in Peru have taken to the streets to demand government action, as did people in Sri Lanka, where the government on Tuesday announced it was defaulting on its US$51 billion in foreign debt.

Poverty rose sharply during the pandemic, and the World Bank warns that for each one percentage point increase in food prices, 10 million people are thrown into extreme poverty worldwide.

""Sharply higher prices for staples and supply shortages are increasing pressure on households worldwide and pushing millions more into poverty,"" the officials said.

""Increased fragility and conflict pose persistent harm to people around the globe.""

124,EN_UA_000104.txt,"Senate blocks sanctions aimed at stopping Nord Stream 2 pipeline 

 The Senate blocked a measure to impose new sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany after the Biden administration warned it could disrupt allied unity in the confrontation over Ukraine.

The measure by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas failed on a vote of 55 to 44. It needed 60 votes to pass.

The vote was held open for several hours as Democrats grappled with a setback on unrelated voting rights legislation.

“Russia has nakedly and unequivocally used energy as energy blackmail,” Cruz said Thursday on the Senate floor. President Vladimir Putin has done that “openly, brazenly and laughingly and absolutely nothing happened,” Cruz said.

Opponents of the measure said it would damage U.S. cooperation with Germany and other NATO partners as they try to head off a potential invasion of Ukraine by Putin’s forces deployed on its borders.

The bill “would undermine the current diplomatic situation,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who had introduced earlier sanctions proposals with Cruz. “We are in a very different situation right now” than when two earlier bills were passed.

The Biden administration also has argued that imposing new sanctions on the undersea pipeline now could undercut the US’s ability to persuade other European nations to join in severe economic penalties later if Russia invades Ukraine.

The legislation “will not counter further Russian aggression or protect Ukraine,” Emily Horne, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement Wednesday. “Instead, it will undermine our efforts to deter Russia and remove leverage the United States and our allies and partners possess in this moment all to score political points at home.”

The White House backed an alternative plan from Senator Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, that would make the sanctions contingent on Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Nearly 40 senators have signed on to that bill.

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the pipeline is what’s divisive. Unlike an older Nord Stream pipeline, the new one bypasses Ukraine.

“The government of Germany should have shelved this project itself a long time ago,” McConnell said. “These sanctions, like the prior Nord Stream 2 sanctions that had overwhelming bipartisan support here in Congress, are not about driving a wedge in Europe. The pipeline itself is the wedge.”

McConnell called for a stronger stance against Russia, saying on the Senate floor that the US should extend additional humanitarian and military support to Ukraine.

“We must not pull our punches out of some fear of provoking Putin,” he said. “What will encourage Putin is if he senses American weakness.”

Construction of the new pipeline is essentially complete, but Germany has yet to issue the certification required for it to begin operating.

Where are Russian troops in Ukraine now?

An estimate of 190,000 Russian troops have been deployed in and around Ukraine for the invasion.

Russia has admitted around 10,000 of their troops have been killed.

Despite peace talks on the Belarusian border, the Ukraine war rages on with no hint of whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will withdraw his troops.

Russia has military control over much of Ukraine's southern regions but is fighting to take control of Mariupol.

RUSSIA LATEST

Which parts of Ukraine has Russia invaded?

Russia has made large sweeps in the south of Ukraine, using Crimea and the separatist supporters in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Troops moved into the Kherson region from Crimea - a territory that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Kherson and Melitopol areas of Ukraine are under control of Russian forces.

There is strong Russian presence in Chernobyl and the surrounding area.

Northern cities of Chernihiv and Konotop, which are closest to the Russian and Belarusian borders, have also been taken.

Why has Russia invaded Ukraine?

Unrest in the Donbas region began in 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea.

Pro-Russian demonstrations escalated into fighting with the Ukraine government forces.

The Minsk agreement of 2015 – between the separatist leaders, Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany – sought to end fighting in the region but without success.

The much feared Russian advance began in the early hours on February 21, 2022, soon after Putin announced he recognised Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states in a bombastic TV address.

Joe Biden and Boris Johnson condemned the move as an ""invasion"" and slapped sanctions on Russian banks and Putin's billionaire cronies.

126,EN_UA_013344.txt,"I was a KGB spy along side Putin and he IS using body doubles – these simple signs are a dead giveaway that he’s a fake 

 A FORMER spy alleges a body double stands in for Vladimir Putin at key events – and has revealed what he says are the tell-tale signs.

Sergei Zhirnov claims to have served alongside the Russian tyrant in the KGB intelligence service of the former Soviet Union, which is now known as the FSB.

Zhirnov said he had believed until now that claims of Putin using doppelgangers were “conspiracy theories”.

But he has now changed his mind, citing a speech made by a “skinny” and coughing Putin on February 21 and contrasting it with an appearance at a pro-war concert next day in Moscow as evidence.

Footage highlights him waving his hands around and repeatedly touching his nose, not traits especially common with Putin.

Zhirnov told Ukrainian TV that “a totally different Putin pops up” with “a wider face as if he bloated in 24 hours”.

""He has a totally different shape of eye orbits, a totally different head, absolutely different wrinkles - a different voice.”

Far from shunning people, perhaps to avoid Covid, he was “almost kissing and hugging everyone”.

His allegation comes as a video shows an unusually exuberant Russian president at a helicopter plant in Siberia.

Zhirnov is now exiled in France and was a former classmate of Putin at KGB Red Flag Institute, a spy training centre.

The claim Putin uses a body double has also been made by the head of Ukrainian military intelligence.

Major General Kyrylo Budanov claimed the body doubles are used to hide Putin’s loss of control in the Kremlin.

He claimed Ukrainian secret services detected Putin body doubles standing in for him on a number of ""special occasions"" in the past, but this had become ""usual practice"" now

""We know specifically about three people that keep appearing, but how many there are, we don't know,"" Budanov said.

""They all had plastic surgery to look alike.""

The spy chief alleged all the doubles had surgery but said the one thing that gives them away is their height.

“It's visible in videos and pictures. Also gesturing, body language and earlobes, since they are unique for every person.""

The claim that Putin uses body doubles is also regularly made by the General SVR Telegram and YouTube channel, which claims to be run by a Kremlin insider.

Most experts dismiss such claims as absurd and far-fetched, though several noticed Putin’s unusually buoyant mood in Siberia, compared to recent public appearances in Moscow.

One claim was that Putin had had an extra dose of medicine.

It has been alleged body doubles were used by former Soviet leaders Josef Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev.

Putin three years ago admitted that officials had considered using doubles, but he claimed the idea was rejected.

""I discarded the idea of any doubles,” he said.

He admitted the idea came up in the early 2000s when Russia was hit by terrorist attacks.

It was suggested a lookalike should take his place at events where the head of state might be at risk, he said.

 MOSCOW—Russia said on Sunday that the United States was responsible for a Ukrainian attack on Crimean peninsula with five U.S.–supplied missiles that killed four people, including two children, and injured 151 more.

The Russian Defence Ministry said four of the U.S.–delivered Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, equipped with cluster warheads, were shot down by air defense systems and the ammunition of a fifth had detonated in mid-air.

Footage on Russian state television showed people running from a beach and some people being carried off on sun loungers.

Russian authorities in Crimea said missile fragments had fallen just after noon near a beach on the north side of the city of Sevastopol where locals were on holiday.

The incident generated a furious reaction among Russian public figures.

The Defense Ministry said U.S. specialists had set the missiles’ flight coordinates on the basis of information from U.S. spy satellites, meaning Washington was directly responsible.

“Responsibility for the deliberate missile attack on the civilians of Sevastopol is borne above all by Washington, which supplied these weapons to Ukraine, and by the Kyiv regime, from whose territory this strike was carried out,” the ministry said.

Russia sent its troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

The United States began supplying Ukraine with longer range ATACMS missiles, which have a 300-kilometre (186-mile) range, earlier this year.

Treating the InjuredSevastopol Governor Mihail Razvozhaev put the death toll at four, with 144 injured, including 82 taken to hospitals. Twenty-seven children were among the injured.

Specialist doctors were being flown in from other parts of Russia.

Russia will respond to Sunday’s attack, the Defense Ministry said, without elaborating. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had been “in constant contact with the military” since the attack.

Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council, described the incident as “a vile, despicable act against our people.”

He likened it to attacks carried out by gunmen on Sunday against a synagogue, a church, and police post in Dagestan and said there was “no difference to us” between the U.S. administration, Ukrainian leaders, and “crazy fanatics.”

Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill said there “was no justification whatsoever for a missile strike on civilians” and expressed indignation that the incident occurred on the Orthodox holiday of Trinity.

Neither Ukraine nor the United States has commented on the attack, which came on a day when Ukraine said one person had been killed and 10 others wounded by Russian strikes on the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: UA is anti-RU extremists', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
128,EN_CC_100172.txt,"How Do Animals React During a Total Solar Eclipse? 

 When a total solar eclipse transforms day into night, will tortoises start acting romantic? Will giraffes gallop? Will apes sing odd notes?

Researchers will be standing by to observe how animals’ routines at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas are disrupted when skies dim on April 8, The Associated Press reported. They previously detected other strange animal behaviors in 2017 at a South Carolina zoo that was in the path of total darkness.

“To our astonishment, most of the animals did surprising things,” said Adam Hartstone-Rose, a North Carolina State University researcher who led the observations published in the journal Animals.

While there are many individual sightings of critters behaving bizarrely during historic eclipses, only in recent years have scientists started to rigorously study the altered behaviors of wild, domestic and zoo animals.

Seven years ago, Galapagos tortoises at the Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, South Carolina, “that generally do absolutely nothing all day ... during the peak of the eclipse, they all started breeding,” said Hartstone-Rose. The cause of the behavior is still unclear.

A mated pair of Siamangs, gibbons that usually call to each other in the morning, sang unusual tunes during the afternoon eclipse. A few male giraffes began to gallop in “apparent anxiety.” The flamingos huddled around their juveniles.

Researchers say that many animals display behaviors connected with an early dusk.

In April, Hartstone-Rose’s team plans to study similar species in Texas to see if the behaviors they witnessed before in South Carolina point to larger patterns.

Several other zoos along the path are also inviting visitors to help track animals, including zoos in Little Rock, Arkansas; Toledo, Ohio; and Indianapolis.

This year’s full solar eclipse in North America crisscrosses a different route than in 2017 and occurs in a different season, giving researchers and citizen scientists opportunities to observe new habits.

“It’s really high stakes. We have a really short period to observe them and we can’t repeat the experiment,"" said Jennifer Tsuruda, a University of Tennessee entomologist who observed honeybee colonies during the 2017 eclipse.

The honeybees that Tsuruda studied decreased foraging during the eclipse, as they usually would at night, except for those from the hungriest hives.

“During a solar eclipse, there’s a conflict between their internal rhythms and external environment,” said University of Alberta's Olav Rueppell, adding that bees rely on polarized light from the sun to navigate.

Nate Bickford, an animal researcher at Oregon Institute of Technology, said that “solar eclipses actually mimic short, fast-moving storms,” when skies darken and many animals take shelter.

After the 2017 eclipse, he analyzed data from tracking devices previously placed on wild species to study habitat use. Flying bald eagles change the speed and direction they’re moving during an eclipse, he said. So do feral horses, “probably taking cover, responding to the possibility of a storm out on the open plains.”

The last full US solar eclipse to span coast to coast happened in late summer, in August. The upcoming eclipse in April gives researchers an opportunity to ask new questions including about potential impacts on spring migration.

Most songbird species migrate at night. “When there are night-like conditions during the eclipse, will birds think it’s time to migrate and take flight?” said Andrew Farnsworth of Cornell University.

His team plans to test this by analyzing weather radar data – which also detects the presence of flying birds, bats and insects – to see if more birds take wing during the eclipse.

As for indoor pets, they may react as much to what their owners are doing – whether they’re excited or nonchalant about the eclipse – as to any changes in the sky, said University of Arkansas animal researcher Raffaela Lesch.

“Dogs and cats pay a lot of attention to us, in addition to their internal clocks,” she said.

 Reporter who helped reveal assassination plot on Putin opposition figure Navalny ‘BANNED’ from BAFTAs

A REPORTER who helped to reveal the plot to murder Russian dissident Alexei Navalny has been ""banned"" from attending this weekend's BAFTAs.

Christo Grozev features in the 2022 film Navalny, which has been nominated for Best Documentary at the awards ceremony.

The film follows the story of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's poisoning in 2020 - and the subsequent efforts of Grozev and fellow investigative journalist Maria Pevchikh revealing the plot to kill the Russian opposition politician.

Navalny, one of Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics, survived the attempt on his life with a deadly nerve agent.

He is currently serving sentences totalling eleven-and-a-half years on charges including fraud and contempt of court.

Taken aback by the ruling, Grozev took to Twitter on Friday to inform his followers.

He said: ""I was surprised to discover that my whole family and I have all been banned by British police from attending this weekend's Bafta awards where the documentary #Navalny is nominated.

""The reason stated: 'We represent a public security risk'.

""I understand the need to keep the public safe (although I don't understand how my son or teenage daughter constitute risk to the public). But moments like this show the growing dangers to independent journalists around the world.

""These dangers don't stem just from murderous dictators, but also from having journalists' voices hushed - instead of amplified - by the civilised world they are trying to serve.""

In response to Grozev's online remarks, Met Police said that police forces generally ""do not and cannot"" ban individuals from attending events, and the decision will rest with the show's organisers.

Despite hand-wringing about ""hostile intentions of foreign states"" in the UK, Met Police said it could not comment on an individual's safety.

A statement read: ""We cannot comment on the safety of an individual or the advice they may have been given.

""However, the situation that journalists face around the world and the fact that some journalists face the hostile intentions of foreign states whilst in the UK is a reality that we are absolutely concerned with.

""We are committed to working with our intelligence partners to investigate these threats and to take other steps to ensure the safety of those concerned.""

The Met added: ""Despite our efforts, on protective security and on investigations, we recognise the impact of those threats on those affected.

""The responsibility for such threats and their potential impact on the wider public lies with the hostile state actors behind them and we have significantly increased the resources applied to bearing down on those.

""More generally, police do not and cannot ban anyone from attending a private event. Decisions about the attendance at an event is a matter for the event organisers.

""We recognise that our advice can mean organisers have difficult choices to make when deciding how best to mitigate any risks to the security of their event, and we are grateful for the ongoing engagement of Bafta.""

Christo Grozev is the lead Russia investigator for investigative group Bellingcat.

The Netherlands-based outfit's work focuses on “security threats, extraterritorial clandestine operations, and the weaponization of information,” according to their website.

Responding to Grozev's Twitter thread, Tory MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Alicia Kearns responded: ""I've raised with ministers - you are not the security risk.""

In a statement given to the PA news agency regarding security at Sunday's ceremony, Bafta said: ""The safety of all our guests and staff at the ceremony is always our highest priority, and we have robust and appropriate security arrangements in place every year.""

Bafta also confirmed that the film's producers Diane Becker, Shane Boris, Melanie Miller and Odessa Rae will be in attendance as nominees for Navalny.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday showed up in Kiev during an unannounced visit, and at an awkward moment for US-Ukraine relations given President Zelensky has been publicly complaining over a decrease in artillery shell supplies, given they are now going to Israel for its war in Gaza.

""I was honored to meet with President @ZelenskyyUa in Kyiv today to reaffirm the United States’ steadfast support for Ukraine,"" Austin wrote on X.

This is Austin's second trip to Kiev since the Russian invasion. ""I’m here today to deliver an important message – the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine in their fight for freedom against Russia’s aggression, both now and into the future,"" he said.

Just last week, CIA Director William Burns also made a secretive, unannounced visit to Ukraine to hold urgent meetings with Zelensky and top military and intelligence officials. Commentary in Asia Times has concluded that this flurry of activity is in response to how badly things are going on the battlefield. Washington has invested many tens of billions of dollars into what's clearly a 'proxy war' against Russia. Asia Times wrote:

Wednesday, November 15th is Z-Day for the War in Ukraine. CIA Chief William Burns will arrive in Kiev for urgent, secret meetings with Zelensky. It is worth asking: How come Burns is on an urgent mission to Ukraine?

The answer to the question is that Ukraine is imploding. The crumbling of the Zelensky regime is unsurprising: Ukraine has been sustaining far too many casualties to survive for much longer. Ukraine either must find a way to make a deal with Russia or face an internal rebellion.

Indeed, there have been recent media rumors and rumblings that Washington has begun to quietly push Kiev to the negotiating table. Was this in any way the focus of these new visits by Burns and Austin?

""The Russian strategy is to bleed-down Ukraine’s armed forces and create a political crisis in Kiev,"" the Asia Times report continued. ""The Russian effort is ahead of schedule, which has surprised Moscow as much as Washington.""

Zelensky has lately sacked and replaced many within his own war cabinet. All of this is a sign of deepening friction, also as Zelensky has admitted that the Gaza crisis has taken the international attention off of Ukraine's war efforts. This has led to waning monetary and weapons support as well.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 New Delhi: Ahead of the presidential election in Nigeria, there has been an explosion of fake news across social media platforms. Divisive content on subjects like religion and ethnicity is also littered across social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and WhatsApp.

According to a report in Al Jazeera, “Social media allows Nigerians to share information in real-time, political strategists are weaponising this ahead of the forthcoming polls.”

A BBC report in January uncovered how Nigerian politicians secretly paid social media influencers as much as 20 million Nigerian naira ($43,000) or promised government contracts and political appointments to spread disinformation about opponents. Some of these influencers are also being recruited to “situation rooms” to monitor the spread of the fake news, the report added.

Meanwhile, Nigeria is grappling with widespread fuel shortages that are forcing motorists to spend hours in lines to buy gas and causing prices to surge for transportation and basic commodities.

Russia’s war in Ukraine has caused prices to import fuel go up by more than 100% but retailers complain they can only charge the price set by the government, causing them to operate at a loss.

The cost of transporting gasoline to the depots has gone up by 80% in the past few months.

Gasoline shortages are frequent in Nigeria even though the country is one of Africa’s biggest producers of crude oil.

However, the country must import most of its fuel because it has very few functioning refineries.

132,EN_UA_015443.txt,"Ukraine War: Kyiv’s allies fear military support will dry up in US election year 

 Ukraine’s Western allies are concerned that the military support for Kyiv may soon peak, as the US enters a divisive presidential, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing unnamed Western officials.

“Ukraine’s allies fear military support for its battle against Russia is nearing a peak, with senior European officials increasingly concerned about the flow of aid next year as the US enters a divisive presidential campaign,” the Financial Times reported.

According to the FT, Washington has been Kyiv’s major source of military aid. US officials interviewed by the newspaper say the remaining funds preapproved by Congress could sustain Ukraine for about another five months. Western officials in regular contact with the US over Ukraine told the FT that Washington sees that period of time as the last real chance for Kyiv to change the situation on the ground.

“We can’t keep the same level of assistance forever,” a European official told the British newspaper as he argued that the current level of support could be sustained for another year or possibly two years but no more.

Politico reported earlier this week that only $6 billion of the original $48 billion military aid package that the US had approved previously now remains. According to the US publication, Washington’s funds for Kyiv may be fully allocated by mid-summer.

European allies are increasingly uncertain about whether the US will come close to matching its existing $48bn package, adopted in 2022, particularly as it requires a vote in Congress this autumn against the backdrop of more partisan debate on the war, FT reported.

Recently, European leaders promised Zelenskyy an arsenal of missiles, tanks and drones during a whirlwind three-day visit to Italy, the Vatican, Germany, France and the U.K. that sought to replenish Ukraine’s depleted weapons supplies ahead of a long-anticipated spring offensive aimed at turning the tide of the war.

Zelenskyy’s energetic international diplomacy over 15 months of war has persuaded Ukraine’s Western allies to send ever more powerful weapons, from German Leopard tanks to U.S. Patriot missile systems and Storm Shadow cruise missiles from the U.K.

The war in Ukraine that began a year ago has killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes, reduced entire cities to rubble and has fuelled fears the confrontation could slide into an open conflict between Russia and NATO.

 The World Economic Forum in Davos has ordered global authorities to radically reduce the number of white people in the world by 2030.

If you thought the Great Replacement was nothing more than a conspiracy theory, you might want to think again.

According to a WEF report, white people are responsible for the vast majority of the world’s problems including climate change and colonialism, and in the interests of an equitable future for the globe, the number of white people must be reduced as a priority.

The WEF has enlisted the United Nations to help with the plan and the results are already playing out before our eyes.

Before we dive in, subscribe to the channel if you haven’t already, and join the People’s Voice Locals community to join our incredible community and support the channel.

The Netherlands has become one of the global elite’s testing grounds for the most extreme policies.

Just as the Netherlands was ground zero for the elite’s war on farmers, Dutch cities are also operating as laboratories for the elite’s plans to depopulate the world and radically alter demographics.

Eva Vlaardingerbroek reports from the Netherlands.

What is wrong with our leaders?

They are fully bought and paid for compromised reprobates who have hitched their wagon to the globalist agenda and take their orders directly from Davos.

Catching the elite in “mask off” moments is nothing short of terrifying.

Take for example footage of a top CDC official saying that the elites must “get rid of of all the whites in the United States” and replace them with immigrants to create a more compliant society.

Dr. Carol Baker was describing what she described as the “solution” at a panel discussion in New York City.

You won’t be surprised to hear that Baker was appointed Chair of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization by Barack Obama’s Health and Human Services Secretary in 2009.

She was also honored with the 2019 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal at a D.C. ceremony sponsored by Pfizer and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Is anyone surprised that a Bill Gates-connected CDC official is openly suggesting depopulating America of white people who don’t cooperate with the elite’s vaccine agenda?

This is the same Bill Gates who told world leaders that it’s time to talk about “death panels” that will sentence ordinary, law-abiding people to death for the crime of being of no use to the elite.

This is the psychopathic world Bill Gates and his associates at the WEF are determined to usher in as part of their Great Reset and Great Replacement.

It gets even worse when you understand how far and wide their evil ideology has spread.

The globalist elite are no longer hiding their plans to depopulate the world by reducing the number of white people. This is a multi-pronged attack and we are now seeing what it looks like in real time.

Of course, the mainstream media are still operating under instructions from the elite to attack anybody who dares to express what they can see with their own two eyes.

They will attack you, shout you down, and pressure your employer to fire you. You might lose your bank account.

You are simply not allowed to talk about the human tragedy of Biden and Harris’ open border, even though Biden is on record laying out his great replacement vision in 2015 in plain English for everybody to understand.

Biden is a compromised puppet politician who has been shamelessly selling out America to the globalists for decades.

Now that he has been sacrificed by the global elite in favor of Kamala Harris and appears to have been replaced by a body double who is approximately eight inches taller than the last version, it is worth pointing out that the elite think we are incredibly stupid.

They really think we are not paying attention to the mountains of evidence proving the multi-pronged attacks maiming and killing the population all have one thing in common.

Chemtrails and mRNA disproportionately target white people in a way that is statistically impossible unless it’s by design.

Of course the plot to depopulate the world has been planned out in detail. The Covid vaccines have long been exposed as a bioweapon designed to cull the herd and depopulate the world.

But it gets even worse, as Robert F. Kennedy explained in New York City. The bioweapon is targeted to take out white people and spare other races.

We can’t allow the evil logic of ethnic bioweapons to become the new normal.

 In response to EU's recent decision to ban Russian media outlets such as RIA Novosti news agency, Izvestia and Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspapers, the Russian authorities blocked 81 EU publications, including Politico, Spiegel, AFP and a number of others. Moscow promised to review the measure if the EU lifts the ban.

The Russian Foreign Ministry banned the broadcasting of 81 European media outlets in response to similar measures that the European Union earlier took against Russian media.

The most recent move will affect, in particular, Politico, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Der Spiegel (Germany), Yle (Finland), El País (Spain), EUobserver, LRT (Lithuania), the Estonian version of Delfi website and other media.

Moscow's measures come in response to the EU broadcast ban on RIA Novosti, Rossiyskaya Gazeta and Izvestia, as well as Voice of Europe for ""war propaganda.” Brussels found that the Russian government controls these media outlets and uses them to promote and support Russia's military operation in Ukraine, ""as well as to destabilise neighbouring countries.” The EU noted that the measure will not prevent media employees ""from carrying out activities in the EU, with the exception of broadcasting.”

EU's Russian media ban comes into force in the European Union on June 25.

""If restrictions on Russian media are lifted, the Russian side will also reconsider its decision in relation to the mentioned media operators,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Maria Zakharova, an official representative of the department, said on June 24 that Moscow developed responsive measures ""realizing that it was useless to hope for Brussels commitment to international legal obligations.”

Since the beginning of hostilities in Ukraine, the EU has banned broadcasting of a number of Russian media, including NTV/NTV Mir, Rossiya 1, REN TV, Channel One, RT and Sputnik. Certain EU countries, such as, for example, Latvia, banned the broadcasting of 80 Russian TV channels. YouTube channels of many Russian media outlets were also blocked. Pravda.Ru YouTube channel was blocked as well.

 Karachi - Unity Foods continues to showcase a strong commitment to ESG principles through a partnership with The Green Ark (TGA). A MoU was signed to this effect between both companies whereby TGA will collect and transform scrap materials from Unity Foods to create a diverse array of recycled products intended for reuse. The initiative aims to facilitate the circular economy by mitigating the impact of single-use plastics that contribute significantly towards the deterioration of global ecosystems.

Unity Foods regularly undertakes lasting projects that align with its objectives to reduce the impact of conventional industrialisation on the environment. Under the current partnership with The Green Ark, a leading recycling solutions provider, Unity Foods will not only ensure the traceability of its packaging waste but also highlight a robust commitment to a greener environment by contributing to the circular economy. With an average of more than 13,000 kilogrammes of waste every month including items like garbage debris, oily pouches, plastic jerry cans, tin scraps, plastic bags, and cardboard cartons, a substantial amount of materials will be recycled which will not end up in landfills or incinerators that ultimately damage nature.

“Global warming is a present and potent threat, especially for Pakistan which despite producing a negligible level of greenhouse gases, faces the brunt of the consequences of this global phenomenon. At Unity Foods, we always aim to set a precedent, particularly with our ESG practices that underscore our commitment to ensuring our children can inherit a safe and healthy planet. This partnership with The Green Ark is another step in this direction and we aim to continue commencing similar initiatives in the future,” commented Ms Nageen Rizvi, Head of Corporate Communications and Sustainability, Unity Foods at the signing ceremony. At the occasion, Mr Habib Elahi, CEO, The Green Ark said, “We are committed to reduce the carbon footprint through recycling waste into resin and building materials such as pavers and tiles made from end-of-cycle plastic waste.

 The United States knew in advance about the attacks on the Nord Stream pipeline, the largest act of industrial terrorism in history, but did not step in to prevent them, according to an interview with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski published today.

In September 2022, Sikorski, then a member of the European Parliament (MEP), insinuated that Washington was complicit in the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipeline.

Sikorski tweeted a photo from the scene of the crime and signed it “Thank you, USA.” The MEP also pointed out Joe Biden’s standing threat to demolish the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. However, his tweet was deleted just a few hours later.

Speaking with Polish news outlet Rzeczpospolita as the Polish foreign minister his week, Sikorski said “If we believe media, it [the attack] was carried out by someone who was interested in it. And the US had preliminary information about this and did not interfere with this move.”

However, Sikorski chose not name those responsible for the crime.

Almayadeen reports: US investigative journalist and Pulitzer award winner Seymour Hersh said on February 8 2023 that US Navy divers planted explosives to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022.

“Last June, the Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as BALTOPS 22, planted the remotely triggered explosives that, three months later, destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, according to a source with direct knowledge of the operational planning,” Hersh wrote in his Substack newsletter.

The White House responded and dismissed the claims as “false and complete fiction.”

Flightradar24 data showed in late September 2022 that US military helicopters habitually and on numerous occasions circled for hours over the site of the Nord Stream pipeline incident near Bornholm Island.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet China’s Xi Jinping for talks in Beijing in October, the Kremlin said on Tuesday, Putin’s first known trip abroad since an arrest warrant was issued against him over the deportation of children from Ukraine.

Nikolai Patrushev, a close Putin ally and the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, said Russia and China should deepen cooperation in the face of the West’s attempt to contain them both.

He was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that the talks in Beijing would be “thorough”, at a meeting in Moscow with China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi.

Putin will attend the third Belt and Road Forum after an invitation by Xi during a high-profile visit to Moscow in March.

Days before that visit, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for Putin’s arrest on suspicion of illegally deporting hundreds of children or more from Ukraine.

Moscow denies the allegations and the Kremlin said the warrant was evidence of the West’s hostility to Russia, which opened a criminal case against the ICC prosecutor and the judges who issued the warrant.

Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine early last year has triggered one of the deadliest European conflicts since World War Two and the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

Putin has pivoted towards China, and Xi has stood by him.

Chinese-Russian trade has soared since the invasion, and Russia has sold Asian powers including China greater volumes of the oil it can no longer sell to the West because of sanctions.

Putin last visited Beijing in February 2022, days before the invasion, where he and Xi announced a ‘no limits’ partnership. Moscow says this does not mean a military alliance, however.

The United States sees China as its gravest long-term “strategic competitor” and Russia as an “acute threat”.

China has refrained from condemning Russia’s operation against Ukraine or calling it an invasion, in line with the Kremlin, which casts the war as a “special military operation”.

Earlier this year, CIA Director William Burns said Russia was becoming more and more dependent on China and was even at risk of becoming its “economic colony” in time.","['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Russia has international support from a number of countries and people', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

 Actress Jane Fonda’s latest performance as a climate change activist drew a slew of criticism as she protested the Alberta oil sands in the Canadian province.

Fonda was castigated by locals, ambushed by a social media reporter and criticized by a left-leaning provincial premier. On Wednesday, at an Edmonton, Alberta news conference, she condemned a fellow-progressive, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying that “people shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking Liberals,” and accused him of “betraying” the Paris climate agreement.

Fonda claimed that, like President Barack Obama, her first impression of Trudeau was one of admiration: “When I heard that your prime minister, the shining hope at the … Paris climate talks, who talked so beautifully about needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty, and respect and hold to the treaties with the Indigenous people, and so forth — such a heroic stance he took there,” Fonda said. “And yet he has betrayed every one of the things that he committed to in Paris.

“I guess the lesson is we shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking liberals, no matter how well spoken they are. What a disappointment.”

But there was disappointment in the remarks of Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, who leads the left-leaning provincial New Democratic Party. She called Fonda “tone deaf” and “ill-informed.”

Fonda received an invitation from the Alberta government to discuss the oil sands but she refused.

“I would suggest if someone was going to come to Alberta … [and] fly over a city that is going through a significant economic downturn, that’s just been through the largest natural disaster in the history of Canada, and then lecture them about where they should get jobs elsewhere, first of all, that’s super tone deaf,” Notley said.

On the first day of her oil sands protest, as she strolled through nearby Fort McMurray, Fonda was ambushed by social media reporter Robbie Picard.

Picard, who hosts the Facebook group OilSands Strong, peppered Fonda with questions about the oil sands, asking her if she was aware of how many First Nations businesses have invested money in the project.

The episode was captured on video by a CBC journalist who was attempting to interview the actress. Fonda did not address any of the questions but insisted, “I’m on your side.”","['CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures']",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 THIS is the horrifying moment Russia appeared to unleash flesh-melting ""thermite bombs"" on a Ukrainian town.

Terrifying footage shows the night sky in Marinka lit up by a chilling rain of sparkling, burning thermite - a killer chemical mixture.

The video, taken through a smashed window by someone sheltering inside a building, shows a huge area of the town in the Donetsk region being showered with the horror bombs.

Ukrainian journalists shared the video on Twitter - describing it as the ""scariest footage of thermite shelling"" they had ever seen.

Marinka is on the frontline of Putin's war in Ukraine as Moscow tries to gain control of the Donbas region - made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces.

Thermite, a mixture of metal powder and metal oxide, is used in the making of incendiary bombs.

It burns at temperatures of more than 2,400C - being so hot it can burn through steel and concrete.

And if it comes into contact with human flesh, it can melt through right down to the bone.

Human Rights Watch previously warned the deadly weapon can cause extremely painful burns on the human skin and can lead to respiratory problems.

The bombs use is significantly dangerous as their wide area of range means they cannot be contained on the battlefield - and its effects could hit civilians.

The killer weapons were used during the Second World War.

The use of thermite as an incendiary weapon is nowadays considered a war crime.

Its use was banned by the third protocol of the 1980 UN Convention on Conventional Weapons in Geneva.

Russia was previously accused of using phosphorus bombs in its effort to take over the Mariupol steel plant Azovstal in May this year.

Dramatic footage showed a Russian missile detonating mid-air above the plant with flaming explosives dropping down.

Ukrainian officials claimed the clip showed Russian forces dropping 9M22S incendiary and phosphorus bombs on the steelworks.

""Russia does not feel threatened"": Estonian Prime Minister calls for long-range missiles to be transferred to Ukraine

Western countries should provide the Armed Forces of Ukraine with all the weapons they need to liberate all the territories seized by Russia. First of all, Kyiv needs to be provided with long-range missiles.

This was the call to the West made by Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas in an interview with The Kyiv Independent published on Sunday, January 14. In her opinion, this is the only way to repel the aggressor country.

The head of the Estonian government reminded that Tallinn had officially decided to provide Kyiv with annual aid of 0.25% of its GDP over the next 4 years. She called on partners and allies to make the same decision.

Kallas said that the joint budgets of the countries that are members of the Ramstein format contact group on Ukraine's defense are ""much larger"" than Russia's budget.

""Every month, Moscow spends about 5.3 billion euros on the war. If we take the total budgets and this 0.25% of the GDP of all the states of the Ramstein coalition, it will be 120 billion. Such assistance would turn the tide in Ukraine's favor. The partners should provide Kyiv with all the military equipment they have,"" said the Estonian prime minister.

The absence of long-range weapons in the Ukrainian army gives the Russian occupation forces an advantage to seize more territories, Kallas noted.

""If they (Russians - Ed.) think they can win, then of course they don't feel threatened and just keep hitting Ukraine,"" the official said.

She also added that some Western countries are afraid that Moscow will lose and what consequences it will have. According to Kallas, the main task now is to end the war.

Speaking in the Estonian parliament on January 11, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine must win the battle against Russia because it is about the survival of the Ukrainian people.

As OBOZ.UA previously reported, the head of state called on the West to strengthen support for Ukraine. He emphasized that the Armed Forces of Ukraine need more shells, and they will move forward.

""Brexit Britain is one of the foremost opponents of the actions of the Putin regime and if you look at the EU, it is countries like Germany who are dragging their feet when it comes to the the response to this crisis.

 If Finland decides to allow a “concentration” of troops on its border with Russia, it would be viewed by Moscow as a threat, the Kremlin said, after Poland offered to send military advisers to help Helsinki monitor the frontier.

The head of the Polish National Security Bureau, Jacek Siewiera, said in a post on social media X that Poland would send military advisers to its NATO ally Finland, in response to “an official request for allied support in the face of a hybrid attack on the Finnish border”.

“A team of military advisers will provide on-site knowledge on border security, also in operational terms,” he said.

Finland said on Thursday it was unaware of the Polish offer. It has closed its entire 1,340 km (833 mile) border with Russia for two weeks in a bid to halt an unusually large flow of asylum seekers that Helsinki says amounts to a “hybrid attack” orchestrated by Moscow, a charge the Kremlin denies.

Asked about the Polish offer to Finland during a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “This is an absolutely redundant measure to ensure border security because there is no threat there.”

“The Finns must be clearly aware that this will pose a threat to us - an increase in the concentration of military units on our borders.”

Any planned deployment would be unprovoked and unjustified, said Peskov.

Finland’s Border Guard and the interior ministry both said they were unaware of any plan to bring Polish military advisers to Finland’s eastern border.

Finnish President Sauli Niinisto held talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda in Warsaw last week but they did not discuss military cooperation on the Finnish border with Russia, Niinisto’s office said in a statement to Reuters.

Finland infuriated Russia earlier this year when it joined NATO, ending decades of military non-alignment, due to the war in Ukraine.","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West: The conflict will increase the Ukrainian refugee flows to Europe', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Russian Plot To Assassinate CEO Of German Arms Giant Dismissed As 'Fake' Intel Story By Kremlin

Top German government and political figures have reacted with outrage to a CNN report alleging that Russian intelligence had plotted to assassinate Armin Papperger, who is the head of Germany's biggest arms company Rheinmetall. The company is among the top European suppliers of 155mm artillery shells, tanks, armored vehicles, and other crucial military equipment to Kiev.

The Kremlin is calling it fantasy and pointing to zero evidence being presented alongside the major accusation. Here's how the bombshell CNN report published late this past week began: ""US intelligence discovered earlier this year that the Russian government planned to assassinate the chief executive of a powerful German arms manufacturer that has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine, according to five US and western officials familiar with the episode.""

There have been widespread allegations for several months in Western media pointing to an irregular and covert Russian warfare campaign to conduct sabotage missions against European defense and manufacturing companies supplying Ukraine.

The CNN report alluded to these prior stories: ""The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine’s war effort, these sources said."" It detailed further that ""The plan to kill Armin Papperger, a white-haired goliath who has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature.""

In recent months, there have been several instances of fires engulfing weapons and ammo manufacturing sites in the UK and on the European continent, some of which we detailed previously. Simultaneously, Russia has been subject of similarly mysterious blazes at defense contractor buildings and companies.

As for the alleged plot to take out the CEO of Rheinmetal, the CNN story is sourced entirely to anonymous intelligence officials, making it impossible to verify at this point, other than taking the word of US, German, and NATO officials.

According to more from the original CNN report, ""When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot. A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US.""

But Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations as 'fake news': ""It's all presented in the style of another fake story, so such reports cannot be taken seriously,"" he said at the end of the week.

Germany and the US reportedly foiled an alleged plot by Moscow to assassinate a leading German arms manufacturing firm's top executive. Why is Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger a target? pic.twitter.com/3tsi7jvxGU— DW News (@dwnews) July 13, 2024

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock belatedly appeared to confirm that the German government finds the warnings credible. ""In view of latest reports on Rheinmetall, this is what we have actually been communicating more and more clearly in recent months: Russia is waging a hybrid war of aggression,"" she had told a press briefing at the NATO summit in Washington.

Papperger himself has since described to the Financial Times that German authorities had imposed a ""great deal of security around my person"" - and he's now considered to be the most highly protected private citizen in all of Germany.

Another interesting aspect to the story is the timing: the CNN revelation corresponded precisely to the close of the annual NATO summit in D.C. at a moment Western officials urged the alliance to stay the course on Ukraine, and commit to supplying more weapons for years to come.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A top Russian military spy has been bombarded with sex toys after his personal email was hacked.

Ukrainian hackers claim they gained access to Sergey Morgachev's AliExpress account, ordering multiple sex toys and gay pride flags in his name.

The embarrassing hack was intended as ""a symbolic act of moral humiliation.""

Morgachev is Vladimir Putin's Lieutenant Colonel at Moscow's chief intelligence office, the GRU.

It is believed he was in charge of Russia's notorious ""Fancy Bear"" hackers, also known as APT28.

The hackers, who call themselves Cyber Resistance, claimed on Telegram that they had managed to break into Morgachev's email account.

Then, they were able to access personal information such as family photos and scanned documents of people associated with him, according to the open-source intelligence site Info Nampalm.

Referring to Morgachev in a message after the theft, the group said ""a very cool and clever hacker, but... We hacked him"".

The hack is considered to appear ""pretty credible"" by Ukrainian hacking expert Stefan Soesanto, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.

Info Nampalm reported that the hack confirmed Morgachev's identity by sifting through stolen personnel files.

Among these was a document that showed him to be a department head in Unit 26165.

The Russian hacker was accused by the FBI of holding the same position in 2018.

He is on the FBI's wanted list for his part in hacking senior US Democrats including Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump's presidential election in 2016.

It is said Morgachev and the GRU ""knowingly and intentionally conspired… to gain unauthorised access into the computers of US persons and entities involved in the 2016 US presidential election,"" according to a federal indictment filed by the Department of Justice.

In the document, he is described by the FBI as an officer in Russia's military spy agency, in a department ""dedicated to developing and managing malware.""

This was said to include the ""X-Agent"" spy software used to hack the DNC.

Microsoft later revealed in 2020 that the US election was targeted by the Russian group who launched attacks on people in both the Trump and the Biden campaign.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Although Ukrainians are doing everything they can to drive out the Russians, ""no one today can predict how long this war will last"", President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says.

""This will depend, unfortunately, not only on our people, who are already giving their maximum,"" he said on Friday in his nightly video address to the nation.

""This will depend on our partners, on European countries, on the entire free world.""

He said he was thankful to those who were working to strengthen the sanctions on Russia and increase military and financial support to Ukraine.

""This is the only recipe for protecting freedom in the face of the Russian invasion. And for Western countries, this is not simply an expense. This is not about accounting, it's about the future.""

Zelenskiy said Ukraine on Friday shot down the 200th Russian aircraft of the war and he noted Russia's heavy losses in tanks, armoured vehicles, helicopters and drones.

""And for what? So that the Lenin statue can stand for a bit longer in temporarily occupied Genichesk? There is and can be no other result for Russia.""

Zelenskiy said Ukraine was engaged in ""very difficult negotiations"" to try to evacuate the wounded fighters trapped in the Mariupol steelworks.

""We're talking about a large number of people. Of course, we are doing everything to evacuate all of the rest, each of our defenders. We have already brought in everyone in the world who can be the most influential mediators.""

Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces had retaken towns and villages from Russian troops. He said work was under way to restore electricity, running water, telephone communications and social services.

 Millions left with no aid as West Africa suffers worst hunger crisis in 10 years, U.N. says

The U.N. World Food Program said Wednesday that millions of hungry people in West Africa are without aid as the agency struggles with limited funding to respond to the region’s worst hunger crisis in a decade.

Nearly half of the 11.6 million people targeted for food aid during the June to August lean season are not receiving any assistance, the agency said in a statement. It warned that hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of joining armed groups, getting married early or engaging in “survival sex” in their desperation to survive.

“We’re in a tragic situation. During this year’s lean season, millions of families will lack sufficient food reserves to sustain them until the next harvests in September,” said Margot Vandervelden, WFP interim regional director for Western Africa. “We must take immediate action to prevent a massive slide into catastrophic hunger,” she said.

Long before last year’s flooding and Russia’s war in Ukraine, West Africa already was facing its worst food crisis in 10 years with more than 27 million hungry people mainly as a result of conflicts but also due to drought and the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

More than 50 million people in the wider East African region are expected to face acute food insecurity this year.

Food insecurity in West and Central Africa is now affecting 47.2 million people in this year’s lean season, when hunger peaks, the WFP said, with women and children the most vulnerable groups.

“Malnutrition rates have also surged, with 16.5 million children under 5 set to be acutely malnourished this year — an 83% rise from the 2015-2022 average,” the agency said.

In central Sahel countries of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger where jihadists have become increasingly deadly, U.N. agencies estimate that the number of people fleeing violence there has nearly quadrupled from 30,000 in January to 110,000 people in June.

“We need a twin-track approach to stop hunger in the Sahel — we must address acute hunger through humanitarian assistance while tackling the structural causes of food insecurity by increasing investments in resilient food systems and expanding government social protection programs,” Vandervelden added.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 The former head of German intelligence has revealed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President of Poland both collaborated to carry out the attack on the Nord Stream Pipelines.

The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were sabotaged on 26 September 2022 after a series of underwater explosions and gas leaks.

Modernity.news reports: Much of the legacy media initially blamed Russia for attack, claiming it was a false flag but offering no sensible reason as to why Moscow would target its own energy infrastructure.

However, during an appearance on German broadcaster WELT-TV, August Hanning, who served as the head of Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service (BND) from 1998 to 2005, the attack was carried out at the behest of Zelensky and Andrzej Duda.

According to Hanning, the act of sabotage occurred as a result of an “agreement between the highest officials in Ukraine and Poland.”

“There were agreements between Zelensky and Duda to carry out the attack,” said Hanning.

As we highlighted yesterday, Germany issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diver believed to be involved in the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines, but Polish authorities failed to stop him at the border and he is now believed to be back in Ukraine.

Berlin issued a European arrest warrant for Ukrainian citizen Volodymyr Z. after identifying him as the chief suspect for placing the explosives that destroyed the pipelines, but Polish authorities claimed they didn’t apprehend the suspect as a result of Berlin not including his name in a database of wanted persons.

The pipeline attack was preceded by warnings from the White House that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would spell the end for Nord Stream 2.

On January 27, 2022, Under-Secretary of State Victoria Nuland stated, “If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.”

On February 7, 2022, President Biden said, “If Russia invades… again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.”

In February 2023, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh published a report asserting that the pipelines were destroyed by the US as part of a covert operation.

According to Hersh’s sources, the explosives were planted in June 2022 by US Navy divers under the guise of the BALTOPS 22 NATO exercise and were detonated three months later with a remote signal sent by a sonar buoy.

It remains to be seen conclusively who ordered and carried out the attack, but the argument that Russia was behind it is looking increasingly tenuous.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Distrust towards Media']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 The Washington Free Beacon reported that BioMADE, a public-private partnership that has received more than $500 million from the DoD, is responsible for the endeavor. BioMADE announced on its website on June 3 that it is looking for new ideas to reduce the CO2 emissions from food production and transport at military sites. These ideas include ""novel cell culture methods suitable for the production of cultivated meat or protein"" – essentially a euphemism for lab-grown fake meat.

Lab-grown meat is a new technology where animal muscle and fat tissues are grown from modified animal cells in special equipment. This process uses a mix of chemicals, pressure and temperature to create meat that resembles beef, chicken and pork. Though still in the experimental stage, lab-grown meat has sparked a debate about its efficiency and ethics of producing meat without killing animals. (Related: Lab-made chicken meat grown from CANCER CELLS receives FDA approval - Are you ready to eat TUMOR nuggets?)

But according to a 2023 study by researchers at the University of California-Davis, the carbon footprint of lab-grown beef might be worse than that of the product it seeks to replace. It zoomed in on the use of highly refined or purified growth media, which is used to help animal cells multiply. They wrote that lab-grown meat using purified media in its production has a global warming potential four to 25 times greater than the average compared to the real thing.

Critics argue that using U.S. troops to test lab-grown meat, which is still experimental and not widely available in stores, is inappropriate. Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved two California companies to sell cultured chicken to restaurants in 2023, some believe taxpayer money shouldn’t fund the lab-grown meat industry.

Jack Hubbard, executive director for the Center for the Environment and Welfare (CEW), was among the vocal critics of the plan. ""Taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund the lab-grown meat sector,"" he remarked.

""Our troops deserve better than to be served lab-grown meat, produced in bioreactors with immortalized cells and chemicals. Unfortunately, this effort is being driven by an agenda that is political and anti-farmer. Our soldiers should never be used as guinea pigs.""

Even Ethan Lane, vice president for government affairs at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, has criticized the DoD research grant that bankrolled BioMADE.

""It is outrageous that the DoD is spending millions of taxpayer dollars to feed our heroes like lab rats,"" he said in a statement. ""This misguided research project is a giant slap in the face to everyone that has served our country. Our veterans and active-duty troops deserve so much better than this.""

""U.S. cattle producers raise the highest-quality beef in the world, with the lowest carbon footprint – and American troops deserve to be served that same wholesome, natural meat and not ultra-processed, lab-grown protein that is cooked up in a chemical-filled bioreactor.""

 FACT CHECK: Viral X Image Purporting To Show Greta Thunberg Holding Anti-Semitic Book Is Digitally Altered

A viral image shared on X, formerly Twitter, purports to show 20-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg holding an anti-Semitic book.

— I,Hypocrite (@lporiginalg) November 28, 2023

Verdict: False

The image is digitally altered. In the original image, shared via Thunberg’s verified X account, she can be seen holding a copy of “The Climate Book.” A spokesperson for Thunberg confirmed the image was fake in an email to Check Your Fact.

Fact Check:

Thunberg has been criticized for chanting “crush Zionism” at a recent pro-Palestine rally in Sweden, according to the Times of Israel. Nigel Savage, founder of the Jewish non-profit Hazon, said Thunberg and other members of the political left “have been intellectually captured by a naive, distorted and frankly bigoted anti-Zionism,” the outlet reported.

The X image, viewed over 800,000 times, purports to show Thunberg holding an anti-Semitic book. “On The Jews And Their Lies,” the title of the book appears to read. The book is supposedly written by German priest and theologian Martin Luther.

The image is digitally altered, however. In the original image, shared via Thunberg’s verified X account, she can be seen holding a copy of “The Climate Book.”

“I’m so pleased to share that The Climate Book is now available in the USA and Canada! I have gathered the wisdom of over one hundred contributors to highlight the many different crises we face and equip us with the knowledge we need to avoid a climate disaster,” Thunberg wrote in the first of two posts promoting the book.

“This is the biggest story in the world, and it must be spoken as far and wide as our voices can carry and much further still. Thank you for your support!

I will not earn money from this book as my copyright belongs to the Greta Thunberg Foundation, so all royalties go to charity,” she added in the second post.

 Three days after Jamie Dimon sparked a marketwide selloff that sent stocks to fresh 2022 lows after he predicted a US recession in “6 to 9” months citing drivers including rising interest rates, persistent inflation, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and warned stocks could drop another 20%, the JPMorgan CEO who is expected to report earnings tomorrow (and hopefully clarify why his bank refuses to move its deposit rate above 0.01% in the process keeping $2.2 trillion in liquidity locked inside the overnight funding facility), doubled down today saying the Fed can’t cool the red-hot economy without bringing on a recession. [bold, links added]

…snip… In separate – and far more provocative -comments made earlier in the day during a JPMorgan investor seminar where he led a fireside chat moderated by JPMorgan’s Gergana Thiel, Dimon made some extremely outspoken comments that you won’t hear on the mainstream media, telling a small group of listeners that was closed to the press that the “President of the United States needs to stand up and say we may not meet our 2050 climate objectives because this is a fucking war.”

He also said, “time to stop going hat in hand to Venezuela and Saudi and start pumping more oil & gas in the USA.”

Echoing what he has said before, Jamie said this is the way the USA maintains its standing, as the future of the world is by pumping more oil and gas and using energy security to ensure Western unity.

And he did say when it comes to ESG that “investors don’t give a shit” warning not to “cede governance to do-gooder kids on a committee.”

Finally, he stressed the need for strong American leadership that is not being provided by either party. His conclusion: the world needs American diplomacy and neither Trump nor Biden can lead the USA.

Fundamentally, Mr. Dimon is right. Fossil fuels provide 80% of our domestic primary energy with an ongoing evolution that has taken about 120 years to build our modern, reliable & affordable domestic energy system. The “energy transition” will not be accelerated by government mandate or fiat. It will be dictated by the laws of physics and the energy imperatives of cost, energy/power density, scale & sustainability. So, Joe Biden can madate we will “openly defy gravity by 2050.” That does not mean we can IMPLEMENT it! We’d better get a fully informed, rational and civilzed debate on energy & attendant environmental policy started soon. Otherwise, the average Americans standard of living will continue to head south. Just ask anyone in the EU how the “Green Dream” is working out. With the current policy course, the U.S is only 2-3 years behind the same DISASTOROUS result…

Jamie Dimon speaks the truth and the Democrats don’t like that. Lower energy costs would lower inflation, but that would require new refineries and some backing from Washington that gives the explorers and drillers confidence. ESG is a money loser. Avoid any entity that promotes it.

(Xinhua/Guo Xulei)

BEIJING, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- China strives to make frontier breakthroughs in science and technology via the advancing computing power of artificial intelligence (AI) that has seen explosive growth in the country.

Scientists and AI developers applauded the revolution of AI-driven scientific research at the two-day AI for Science Summit in Beijing, which started on Thursday.

""AI development benefited from science,"" said Tang Chao, a professor from the Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies (AAIS) at Peking University, at the meeting. ""Now, we're looking forward to embracing a stage where AI facilitates scientific progress.""

AI for Science (AI4Science) can form an interdisciplinary platform and help scientists to solve complicated problems to improve research efficiency and quality, said E Weinan, president of the AI for Science Institute in Beijing.

AI4Science demands four pillars of infrastructure -- algorithm models and software, effective measures to represent experimental data, database and knowledge repository, and integrated computing platform, said E.

The Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Natural Science Foundation of China jointly kickstarted a project to promote the use of AI in frontier sci-tech research in March.

The project will deploy AI models and algorithms in gene research and biology breeding breakthroughs.

Also, interdisciplinary research and development teams will be brought together to promote the establishment of an innovation consortium and build international academic exchange platforms to offer solutions to human scientific challenges, including cancer treatment and the climate crisis.

E said AI4Science might bring revolutionary changes in new materials, energy, aviation, and pharmaceuticals.

Using AI and one of the world's fastest supercomputers, Chinese scientists have already started to engineer otherwise unknown chemicals to be clinically used in the future.

With the Tianhe-2 supercomputer in south China's Guangdong Province, scientists and computer experts with Beijing-based AI startup Galixir developed a practical deep-learning toolkit to predict the biosynthetic pathways for natural products, the primary source of clinical drug discovery.

Empowered by AI-based algorithms, the computer also offers clinicians tools to discern types of gastric cancer and discover signs of nasopharynx cancer among high-risk populations.

The new application scenarios are also a source of opportunities for the AI industry.

 MSM Admits ""Magical Thinking"" Guided Its Reporting On Ukraine... Many Thousands Of Deaths Later

A very short while ago, any US politician or media pundit publicly calling for peace negotiations in Ukraine with Russia's Putin was branded 'pro-Kremlin' and somehow compromised. For example, mainstream media has sought to isolate and cancel thinkers like John Mearsheimer for his realism toward Moscow and the conflict, and urging immediate ceasefire which would require territorial concessions from Kiev. It was only in September that one prominent publication branded him ""the world's most hated thinker.""

But now, at a moment Ukraine's leadership itself has become more desperate while admitting its forces are facing almost insurmountable odds, the D.C. beltway consensus has clearly and drastically changed, and now it's apparently okay to admit the following...

The War Street Journal acknowledges that the narratives it’s been pushing for months — of a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, a possible palace coup in Moscow, a Russian economy in tatters — are “Magical Thinking.” In other words, their coverage has been a fraud. pic.twitter.com/ZxB25W61Kn— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 16, 2023

The WSJ piece actually calls for a longer-term strategy of confronting Russia, while also admitting that Washington's approach thus far has been based on ""magical thinking"".

Or else we might just call the establishment narrative to this point fraudulent:

What Western leaders conspicuously haven’t done is level with their publics about the enduring nature of the threat from an emboldened, revisionist Russia. They have indulged all too often in magical thinking—betting on sanctions, a successful Ukrainian counter-offensive or the transfer of new types of weapons to force the Kremlin to come to the negotiating table. Or they have hoped to see Putin overthrown in a palace coup.

Elsewhere in the article, the authors point out that contrary to how the Wagner rebellion was widely presented in Western press, the reality is that whole episode actually strengthened Putin:

As Russian President Vladimir Putin looks toward the second anniversary of his all-out assault on Ukraine, his self-confidence is hard to miss. A much-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive has not achieved the breakthrough that would give Kyiv a strong hand to negotiate. Tumult in the Middle East dominates the headlines, and bipartisan support for Ukraine in the U.S. has been upended by polarization and dysfunction in Congress...

Putin has reason to believe that time is on his side. At the front line, there are no indications that Russia is losing what has become a war of attrition. The Russian economy has been buffeted, but it is not in tatters. Putin’s hold on power was, paradoxically, strengthened following Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed rebellion in June. Popular support for the war remains solid, and elite backing for Putin has not fractured.

The tragedy is that so many people from both sides died for a year for nothing— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 16, 2023

Of course, none of this has stopped Zelensky as well as his friends in US Congress from seeking to push through more billions in American taxpayer aid for Ukraine.

On a global level too, Moscow has made inroads and gotten closer with other well-armed powers who find themselves in Washington's crosshairs...

Zelensky has recently complained that ""Russia's goal"" to take the global focus away from the Ukraine war is working, particularly against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas conflict and rising tensions in the Middle East. But certainly for now, Ukraine has taken a far backseat among the list of current Biden administration priorities, it seems. Perhaps indeed there's less ""magical thinking"" these days.

157,EN_CC_100203.txt,"IMF’s Climate Call 

 The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recent call for enhanced transparency in Pakistan’s budgetary considerations for climate adaptation is timely and crucial, coinciding with the nation’s active pursuit of international support at COP28 in Dubai. As caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar leads Pakistan’s representation, transparency emerges as a cornerstone for effective policy-making and attracting climate-related financing.

The IMF’s recommendation to make the FY 2024-25 budget a turning point for climate adaptation planning underscores the imperative to integrate climate considerations into financial decisions. Seeking transparency on climate-related actions with budgetary implications aligns with the global recognition of the need to harmonise financial decisions with climate goals. This emphasis reflects an acknowledgment that fiscal sustainability analysis under diverse climate change scenarios is vital for informed decision-making.

Despite capacity constraints, the urgent call to train staff for climate initiatives underscores the necessity of investing in the nation’s ability to navigate climate challenges. Strengthening the capacity of relevant ministries, including the Ministry of Climate Change, Planning Commission, and Climate Change Authority, aligns with broader goals such as achieving National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) and National Determined Contributions (NDC) targets.

The IMF’s recommendation to publish climate-related spending for FY 2023-24, coupled with advancing green budgeting, signifies a commitment to transparency and accountability. Extending the green tracking system to all provinces, supported by the controller general of accounts, emphasises the need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach.

As part of the ongoing $3 billion standby arrangement, fulfilling the structural benchmark regarding climate public investment plans is crucial for meeting international commitments. Strengthening the appraisal process for investments and projects, including specific guidance on climate factors, ensures comparability and alignment with climate targets. The IMF’s holistic advice to adapt the entire budget formulation and approval process to climate change requirements signifies a forward-looking approach.

158,EN_UA_014014.txt,"End overseas trade settlement in dollar, use your own currency: Brazil President Lula to BRICS nations 

 Beijing: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has called for the BRICS nations to give up US dollar and come up with their own alternative currency to settle cross-border trade.

During his first state visit to China since taking office in January, Lula also lashed out the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and criticised the outsize role of the greenback in global trade.

His comments came mere days after the Brazilian government ditched dollar as an intermediary and announced a deal to trade in local currency with China.

Lula voices for de-dollarization

Lending his voice to China’s efforts to shed the dollar’s dominance and promote the use of the renminbi (RMB)/ yuan in overseas trade settlement, the Brazilian President said: “Who was it that decided that the dollar was the currency after the disappearance of the gold standard?”

“Why can’t we do trade based on our own currencies?” he said during his address at the New Development Bank in Shanghai, known as the “BRICS bank”.

“Every night I ask myself why all countries have to base their trade on the dollar,” Lula added.

It is being said that at the BRICS annual summit in South Africa, the member countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – will create a new currency to facilitate overseas trade. The final agreement could come up as early as in August this year.

As per reports, Russia is behind the idea of the alternative currency as it continues to face economic sanctions from the West over its invasion of Ukraine.

Don’t chase dollars

“Why can’t a bank like the BRICS bank have a currency to finance trade between Brazil and China, between Brazil and other BRICS countries?… Today, countries have to chase after dollars to export, when they could be exporting in their own currencies,"" Lula said.

Hitting out at the IMF, Lula alluded to accusations the global lenders’ overly harsh spending cuts on cash-strapped countries like Brazil’s neighbour Argentina in exchange for bailout loans.

“No bank should be asphyxiating countries’ economies the way the IMF is doing now with Argentina, or the way they did with Brazil for a long time and every third-world country,"" he said.

“No leader can work with a knife to their throat because (their country) owes money,"" he added.

Brazil-China trade

Trade between Brazil and China soared over the past decade to $150.4 billion in 2022.

China imports agricultural commodities and minerals from Brazil apart from investing in the Latin American country’s consumer market and infrastructure sector.

Earlier this week, the Brazilian branch of the state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China settled its first overseas transaction directly in RMB in the country. With the increase in bilateral trade and growing economic relationship, both countries have now been using their respective currencies to settle payments.

Can yuan be the new dollar?

The Chinese yuan’s role in trade finance has more than doubled since the Ukraine war, but at present, it is a poor contender to replace the US dollar as the global currency.

Not only is it virtually pegged to the dollar, China’s tight control of its currency keeps it from adhering to free market flows.

 Warning US could be ‘hit with most debilitating strike EVER’ in space war with Russia after chilling ISS threat

THE US could be hit with the most debilitating and destructive strike ever in a potential space war with Russia, an expert warns.

Relations between Moscow and Washington have plunged to new lows amid the Ukrainian crisis, and Russia’s space agency warned that US sanctions could “destroy” cooperation on the International Space Station.

Moscow claimed Washington needs its cooperation to prevent the ISS from falling on the US or Europe.

Geopolitical and space expert Brandon J Weichert told The Sun that Moscow has a decade to a 12-year advantage on the US in the galaxies.

He said US defenses are in “no way fit” to deal with the challenges posed by Russia.

Weichert warned: “We are going to get hit very hard soon in space. It is going to be the most debilitating strike on America, possibly ever.

“And we may not recover from it in a timely fashion. This could be how we lose our first war on Earth is losing the war in space.”

Weichert slammed the ""arrogant"" DC political class, claiming they didn’t foresee any rival challenging Washington’s dominance in the post-Cold-War world.

He said: “They thought there would never be a need for any kind of preventative or security measure because we thought we would always be dominant, and we thought no one would be crazy enough to challenge us.

“Well here we are 30 years later, and you have Russia, China, North Korea, and even Iran showing us that it was the wrong assumption.”

The expert feared that the US has a 60 percent chance of being pushed out of space by its rivals completely.

President Biden unleashed a package of sanctions against Moscow on Thursday after Putin’s forces rolled into Ukraine.

And, an additional 7,000 troops will be sent to Eastern Europe to bolster Nato’s defenses.

Russia’s invasion of the besieged nation saw Europe plunged into its biggest crisis since World War II.

Experts claim the world has not seen a crisis since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s.

The flashpoint was the closest point the world came to a full-blown nuclear war.

US intelligence feared that Kyiv could fall within 96 hours and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it’s a “possibility” that Putin could move beyond the borders of Ukraine.

The Russian strongman may feel emboldened and seek to move on to other nations if successful.

Troops have reportedly already been spotted in the Belarussian city of Brest – 10 miles east of the Polish border.

Biden told reporters Thursday: “He has much larger ambitions. He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is all about.”

Weichert said: “If Putin suspects the West will prop up a formidable anti-Russian resistance in a post-invasion Ukraine, he will risk not only nuclear war but also will threaten to attack US assets in space and the ISS.

“Putin fully understands the concept of asymmetrical warfare.”

He speculated that Moscow will ramp up its threats in cyberspace and nuclear warfare.

PUTIN'S THREATS

In December, Weichert warned that Moscow is plotting to launch a Pearl Harbor attack on the US in the cosmos.

The Pearl Harbor attack of December 1941 left America reeling as Japanese forces bombed the US naval port.

In his book, Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower, Weichert says that Russian co-orbital satellites, known as space stalkers, have been tailgating US satellites for years.

He predicts that the stalkers will eventually hit the satellites, sending them crashing into the ground.

Weichert believes Russia is preparing to launch a ""devastating"" attack on American satellites at the time of its own choice.

He warned that before launching an attack on Washington’s satellites, Moscow would ""engage in a series of escalations” with neighboring nations.

Russia conducted an anti-satellite weapon test (ASAT) in November where it destroyed one of its own satellites that had been in orbit since 1982.

Blinken branded the test ""dangerous and irresponsible"" as it created a field of 1,500 pieces of debris, forcing the ISS crew to take shelter.

State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the test marked an increase in the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS.

 by Prof Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research:

The World Economic Forum (WEF) which represents the Western financial elites, played a key role in the launching of the March 11, 2020 corona lockdown, which was conducive to a Worldwide process of economic and social chaos. It also played a key role in the launching of the Covid-19 vaccine. in November 2020.

And now they are “promising” us a crisis which is “Much Worse than Covid”.

Over the last three years the deliberate triggering of chaos has become part of a broad and complex agenda: the war in Ukraine, the hike in energy prices, the triggering of bankruptcies, the collapse of economic activity, widespread poverty, famine and despair.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

In recent developments, Washington has endorsed Israel’s genocide directed against the People of Palestine, coupled with an unfolding US-NATO-Israel military agenda against the broader Middle East.

Cyber-Attacks

The article below focusses on the imminent dangers of Cyber Warfare, which have already been announced by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

In 2021, the WEF conducted a simulation of Cyber Attacks involving a scenario of Paralysis of the Power Supply, Communications, Transportation, The Internet.

Klaus Schwab intimated in no uncertain terms based on “a simulated scenario” that a cyber-attack:

“Could bring a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole …

The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyberattack.” (emphasis added)

What does Schwab have up his sleeve?

A “Cyber Terrorist Attack” conducive to unprecedented disruptions? Is this something that we should take seriously?

A renewed fear campaign, a warning of an impending danger? In the words of Jeremy Jurgens, who is the WEF’s Managing Director:

“I believe that there will be another crisis. It will be more significant. It will be faster than what we’ve seen with COVID. The impact will be greater, and as a result the economic and social implications will be even more significant.” (emphasis added)

The 2021 WEF cyber polygon simulation scenario had an obvious “contradictory” geopolitical slant:

The event was chaired by Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, numerous Russian financial institutions, media and communications entities had been invited by the WEF.

Forty-eight countries participated in the Event, there were 41 partners of which 10 were from Russia and Kazakhstan: these included News Agency TASS, NTV, Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank and a leading global financial institution, the Mail.ru Group, Russia’s largest internet provider, MTS, Russia’s leading telecommunications group, the State Legal Department of the Omsk Region, Siberia. Powerful banking financial institutions from Kazakstan. Among others.

See also the assumptions of the Training Program, which are predicated on terrorist cyber hackers.

Amply documented, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has been instrumental in endorsing US-NATO’s military agenda in regards to Ukraine.

Was this July 2021 Cyber Polygon event (which occurred less than 8 months prior to the outset of the Ukraine War) intent upon creating political divisions within the Russian Federation by establishing partnerships with a number of powerful Russian media, communications, banking and financial institutions, etc.

Not a single representative from the People’s Republic of China. Was the Cyber Polygon Simulation (July 2021) intended to foster confrontation between China and Russia? Are Cyber attacks contemplated as part of a Global Military agenda?

The Process of “All-Digitization”

In November 2023, as documented in an article by Peter Koenig, the Financial Elites passed from the “study of scenarios” to “implementation”.

British colonel: Ukrainian operation in Kursk region humiliated Putin and showed cowardice of allies

The first major attack on Russian territory since World War II, the Ukrainian Armed Forces' offensive in the Kursk region, has publicly humiliated Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. However, he is not the only one who was humiliated and stunned by the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian territory. Ukraine's partners, among those who provide weapons but restrict their use, are in the same position.

This is the opinion of Colonel Richard Justin Kemp, a retired British Army officer and knight, who was awarded the highest honor in the UK. In his opinion, the Ukrainian offensive ""showed the cowardice of the allies,"" especially US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Sir Richard Kemp recalls how President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously asked Western partners to allow the use of long-range weapons to protect both Ukrainian soldiers and Ukraine in general.

""The British Storm Shadow missiles could make a difference in this battle, but the British government is unwilling to allow them to be used to their full potential. What, in Sir Keir Starmer's opinion, is the point of a strike on Russian territory, apart from protecting Ukraine? And how would the Second World War have ended if the Prime Minister had not allowed British and American bombs to fall on German soil?"" asks the colonel.

According to Sir Richard Kemp, throughout the entire period of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, ""the most pathetic were the Western allies"" who pursued a policy not based on Ukraine's defense needs, ""but on the groundless fear of Russian retaliation."" And although all of Putin's so-called red lines turned out to be nothing more than baseless intimidation, each subsequent Western decision to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, tanks, or combat aircraft ""was reluctant, half-hearted, inadequate, and gripped by fear.""

Incidentally, it was these fears and the ""miserable policy"" of the partners that ensured the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, the Briton believes.

""Ukraine was able to launch an unexpected attack on Russian territory because most of the border with the enemy was left almost unguarded. The fact is that Putin knew that his territory remained virtually invulnerable to attack because of Western restrictions on the use of weapons. This also applies to airfields, supply routes, and logistics bases. Significant forces needed to protect them have been thrown into the war in Ukraine,"" the colonel said.

""What Western leaders don't realize is that when you're facing a tyrant like Putin, escalation is the only language he fears and understands. We see the same thing in the Middle East, where Biden is pleading with Israel to de-escalate. But his unconvincing 'no' will not stop Ayatollah Khamenei from pushing the button and launching Iran's expected missile attack, just as it did not stop Putin from attacking Ukraine,"" Sir Richard Kemp said.

Ukraine's offensive near Kursk has taught the West a ""salutary lesson,"" the military said.

""Despite the capture of thousands of square kilometers of Russia's holy shrines, no nuclear missiles were raining down on Kyiv. The truth is that if Ukraine had been allowed to escalate from the very beginning, it could have brought this war to an end on favorable terms for Kyiv,"" the British colonel believes.

162,EN_UA_001052.txt,"NATO ‘Cautiously Optimistic’ Amid Reports of Russian Troop Withdrawal 

 After Russia announced Tuesday that it will pull out some troops from near the Ukrainian border, top NATO officials expressed that they are “cautiously optimistic” for a de-escalation of tensions.

“There are signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue. This gives grounds for cautious optimism. But so far we have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday morning following Russia’s announcement.

Russia did not say how many units were being withdrawn, and how far, after a build-up of some 130,000 Russian troops to the north, east, and south of Ukraine. Video footage posted online by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Tuesday allegedly showed Russian tanks moving back to their permanent bases and away from the border.

NATO said that it has yet to see evidence of a de-escalation in the crisis.

“Russia has amassed a fighting force in and around Ukraine unprecedented since the cold war. Everything is now in place for a new attack,” Stoltenberg said. “But Russia still has time to step back from the brink, stop preparing for war and start working for a peaceful solution.”

The Kremlin said Tuesday’s developments were proof that Western talk of war had been both false and hysterical.

“February 15, 2022 will go down in history as the day Western war propaganda failed. Humiliated and destroyed without a single shot fired,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement, according to Reuters.

On Monday, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko told Russian media the United States and the West are trying to “spark a conflict” with recent statements about a possible invasion.

“Look, if we planned any war against Ukraine, the media would have behaved completely differently. Because the media is the modern war’s bombardments,” he said.

France said it had yet to confirm the return of some Russian troops to bases, though this would be a positive sign. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, on the latest Western diplomatic mission to defuse the crisis, met Putin in the Kremlin.

Over the past weekend and on Monday, White House officials called on Americans to leave Ukraine and asserted that an invasion could occur in the near future. No evidence was provided for the second claim.

The U.S. Department of State also shut down its embassy in Kyiv and moved it to Lviv, located in the western part of Ukraine.

“We are in the process of temporarily relocating our Embassy operations in Ukraine from our Embassy in Kyiv to Lviv due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

“These prudent precautions in no way undermine our support for or our commitment to Ukraine. Our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering,” Blinken added, noting that “the path for diplomacy” is available.

Around the same time, confusion was sparked when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a statement on Facebook that said Russia would invade on Feb. 16. However, his office later said that he made the remarks sarcastically in an apparent attempt to make light of various Western intelligence reports suggesting an imminent invasion.",['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader'],['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Al Gore made the new Global Warming prediction from Davos as he sat outside in the freezing cold weather with a snowy backdrop.

“The good news is that once we get to true net zero and stop adding, the temperatures will stop going up almost immediately, with a lag of as little as three years,” Al Gore said without providing any evidence whatsoever to back up his new timeline.

Gore continued, “And if we stay at true net zero half of the human cause to greenhouse gas pollution will fall out of the atmosphere in as little as 25 to 30 years, but getting there is very tough.”

On December 13, 2008, junk scientist Al Gore predicted the North Polar Ice Cap would be completely ice-free in five years.

And, with this lie, the global warming hysteria began.

Gore made the prediction to a German audience on December 13, 2008. Al warned them that “the entire North ‘polarized’ cap will disappear in 5 years.” The Gateway Pundit reported on this at the time.

This wasn’t the only time Al Gore made his ice-free prediction. Gore had been predicting the dire scenario since 2007. That means that the North Pole should have melted completely over a decade ago by now.

Al Gore also made the same prediction in 2009.

Just as he promised to do, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a left-wing Democrat, is going after people’s meat with new plans to save the world from “climate change” by forcing everyone to become a “plant-based” vegetarian or vegan.

Along with representatives from the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy and the Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, Adams has announced the launch of a new “carbon footprint” and household food consumption tracking scheme that aims to reduce the Big Apple’s “carbon emissions” by 33 percent by the year 2030.


In order to cut all that carbon, Adams and his allies are imposing new “caps on meat” that, as the name suggests, will limit the amount of meat that New Yorkers are allowed to purchase and consume at public institutions – and eventually within their own homes as well.

(Related: Last month, we warned you that Adams was planning to unleash a horrific new food policing apparatus against New Yorkers, and now he has.)

Eric Adams wants all New Yorkers to become vegans

At a pre-Earth Day event held at a Brooklyn culinary center run by NYC Health + Hospitals, the city’s public health care system, Adams unveiled a chart depicting New York City’s greenhouse gas inventory. This inventory supposedly tracks the carbon footprint generated by household food consumption.

With the help of American Express, C40 Cities, and EcoData, Adams revealed carbon emissions data about household food consumption, which was added to existing carbon emissions data on energy use, transportation, and waste.

Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala from the NYC Department of Environmental Protection unveiled the new household food consumption data. Aggarwala, by the way, also founded the Google smart city subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, which collects data in order to forge “a new standard for what cities have to do” as a novel way to shape policy.

While the inventory that Aggarwala presented will also now include greenhouse gas “pollution” from the production and consumption of consumer goods like clothing, air travel, and health care, Adams focused his efforts at the event specifically on the foods that New Yorkers consume – mainly meat and dairy, which he personally opposes.

“Food is the third-biggest source of cities’ emissions right after buildings and transportation, but all food is not created equal,” Adams unsubstantially stated. “The vast majority of food that is contributing to our emission crisis lies in meat and dairy products.”

“It is easy to talk about the emissions that’s coming from buildings and how it impacts our environment, but we now have to talk about beef. And I don’t know if people are ready for this conversation.”

Other than fish, Adams reportedly abides by a “plant-based” vegan diet, which he says helped him overcome diabetes. He wrote a vegan cookbook to promote his personal dietary choices, which he now wants all New Yorkers to follow in order to stop “global warming.”

“We already know that a plant-powered diet is better for your physical and mental health, and I am living proof of that,” Adams declared. “But the reality is that thanks to this new inventory, we’re finding out it is better for the planet.”

The simplistic way in which Adams couched his argument against meat and dairy has already been debunked by people who are actually educated in such things, including Melissa McKendree, PhD, an agricultural economist at Michigan State University.

“Different meats have different kinds of greenhouse gas footprints,” McKendree clarified about how pasture-raised animals do not harm the environment like feedlot animals do. “All land is not created equal.”","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other']",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And it's worth digging a little deeper into the issues behind the net-zero issue, that being the advocacy for net zero carbon emissions, something that is all but impossible. Why? Because of the things required for the manufacture of electric vehicles (EVs); specifically, their batteries and, even more specifically, the raw materials required to make those batteries.

This brings us to Indonesia and the environmental havoc that mining for nickel, an essential component of EV batteries, is wreaking on that country.

Swathes of rainforest and coastal communities are being destroyed by a nickel mining boom in Indonesia sparked by the race to transition away from fossil fuels.

Across the country, a major drive to exploit the country’s abundant natural resources is underway. These photographs capture the sheer scale of the production process.

Rows of chimneys, belching smoke and fumes, tower over the schools and houses of what were once rural communities in scenes recalling the work of L.S. Lowry, whose paintings captured life in the industrial districts of North West England in the mid-20th century.

Indonesia is now the world’s largest nickel producer, with 15 per cent of the globe’s lateritic nickel resources – typically low-grade deposits found near the surface.

But demand is still soaring in tandem with the rise of the electric vehicles (EVs), which depend on it for their batteries.

Guess who is, in large part, funding all this?

Billion dollar Chinese firms anchor the nickel market in Indonesia, but they are often fed cheap ore by hundreds of smaller, mostly locally-owned mines that dot the rainforest. These mines have transformed once-peaceful agrarian villages and communities, providing economic opportunity but a health and environmental crisis looms from pollution.

In just three years, Indonesia has signed more than a dozen deals worth more than $15 billion for battery materials and electric vehicle production with global manufacturers including Hyundai, LG and Foxconn.

Granted, nickel extraction will probably go on regardless of the EV push, regardless of the net-zero goals of climate scolds, and we should remember that extraction and refining bring jobs to impoverished communities in Indonesia. That's not the point that we should be examining here.

It's the hypocrisy of the climate scolds ignoring these inescapable consequences of their agenda that's galling.

That's always been the whole problem with these people; they never count the cost, all the costs, of the agenda for which they advocate. They are of a kind with (and in many cases are the same people) who complain about, say, my going into the woods to shoot a grouse or a snowshoe hare for supper, demanding to know why I can't get my meat at a grocery store so no animal has to die. They are of a kind with the ""Stop Oil"" protesters who block traffic for hours, forcing people to sit with their car engines idling, pouring still more exhaust into the air. They are of a kind with the Greta Thunbergs of the world, ill-informed scolds who want to dictate the end of our modern, technological lifestyles.

They never figure situations like the mining of nickel for EV batteries in Indonesia into their calculus, any more than they account for the mining of cobalt with slave labor in Congo, or mining for lithium and its accompanying environmental disturbance.

To put it bluntly, they are hypocrites of the worst sort. Why do they ignore these problems with their policies? Is it just because these particular environments are far away and out of sight of these mostly affluent, mostly Western activists?

Or are they just ignorant?

 Putin’s unwillingness to use sufficient force to end a conflict that should not have lasted one week is leading to much wider war.

NATO at the summit in Vilnius is likely to approve plans to increase the number of troops in a state of high alert to 300,000, as well as other changes in the military structure, said Secretary General Stoltenberg.

Plans to increase the number of its rapid reaction forces to more than 300 thousand. people from 40,000. Stoltenberg said in June 2022. He noted that this will take place within the framework of the implementation of new regional plans.

In May, Stoltenberg said that these plans would be described as a bloc to deter and protect NATO allies from any aggression: they contain precise demands for the transformation of the armed forces, including their deployment. The Secretary General also announced more Allied exercises, bringing more forces into combat readiness, strengthening the command structure and control in the alliance.

As reported in March, the increase in the number of the military may imply the emergence of two echelons. The first will be 100,000. soldiers ready to be sent within ten days. The second echelon is reinforcements, that is, the military sent for support, they will have to be ready for the transfer within 10-30 days.

The Spanish El Pais reported in May that the bloc was finalizing a common strategy to counter the threat from Russia and terrorism. This strategy, according to sources of the publication, is changing NATO’s approaches to deploying forces in different regions and responding to threats from Moscow.

 Letters to the Editor: Oil companies are killing the planet. Now they want to sell us a fake solution?

To the editor: Let’s recognize “carbon management” for what it is — a fossil fuel industry euphemism for commodifying pollution and providing life support to this dirty industry. While urgent action is needed to address the climate emergency, carbon capture is not a real solution. (“Will storing CO2 in old oil fields slow global warming? First California plan nears approval,” Jan. 14)

The process in question requires vast amounts of energy and water. The presence of oil wells and pipelines can result in dangerous and potentially deadly leaks. That’s especially true of improperly plugged wells in the oilfields that companies like California Resources Corp. want to use as carbon dumping grounds.

Carbon capture and storage projects divert funds away from what is truly needed: a just transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as wind and rooftop solar.

Rather than marking “a drastic transformation for fossil fuel companies” and communities, as oil industry supporters claim, carbon management is nothing more than corporate greenwashing intended to keep these polluting companies in business.

To the editor: Let me see if I understand this correctly.

California Resources Corp. wants to utilize its depleted oil fields to store carbon emissions deep underground. This company polluted California for decades, for profit, and now it wants to utilize the same ground that is basically a wasteland of little to no value to store carbon emissions that resulted from the extraction of its product in the first place.

The company made unbelievable amounts of money extracting fossil fuels that have resulted in the loss of many lives through their detrimental effects on the environment. Now, it wants to be part of the solution by profiting from the removal of the very same environmental toxins.

I think California Resources Corp. could pay for this sequestration itself in an attempt to mitigate the horrid effects it’s had on the human population over the decades. But then again, there would be no profit in that.

 Russia – Exposure of ‘dirty bomb’ plans caused panic in Kiev

“Many signs” show Ukraine is winding down its program amid Moscow’s revelations, a senior diplomat claimed

Kiev might be shelving its alleged ‘dirty bomb’ program after Russia exposed it, Moscow’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, claimed on Tuesday. He added that Ukraine may well have time to do this before the upcoming nuclear inspection.

Over the last few days, Russian officials, including Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, have been accusing Kiev of preparing a false-flag attack with the use of a ‘dirty bomb’, a device combining conventional explosives with radioactive material. Ukraine has categorically denied Moscow’s claims.

“If you read the Ukrainian Telegram channels, you would see that there is a lot of fuss in the Ukrainian ruling circles now because of the campaign that we have started to launch, and there are many signs that they are trying to sort of wind down this program,” Polyansky said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.

In his opinion, Ukraine has enough time to scale back the ‘dirty bomb’ plans before the upcoming visit of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors.

“They can come, but I am telling you that a ‘dirty bomb’ is not a very complex device,”Polyansky explained, adding that there is no guarantee that Kiev will not resume its alleged activity after the inspectors depart.

At the same time, the official claimed that the danger of Kiev using a ‘dirty bomb’ remains “very high,” and that Ukraine “has the opportunity” and “has every reason to use it.”

Earlier on Tuesday, in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Russian mission’s head, Vassily Nebenzia, said that Moscow would consider the use of a ‘dirty bomb’ by Ukraine “an act of nuclear terrorism.”

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba earlier called the Russian allegations “as absurd as they are dangerous.” He also noted that “Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves.”

On Tuesday, the minister revealed that Ukraine had invited IAEA inspectors to come and to “prove that Ukraine has neither any dirty bombs nor plans to develop them.”

“Good cooperation with IAEA and partners allows us to foil Russia’s ‘dirty bomb’ disinfo campaign,” Kuleba said.

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, commenting on the matter, said that “all parties should avoid any actions that could lead to miscalculation and escalation of what’s already a devastating conflict.”

Meanwhile, the Pentagon claimed that Russia’s allegations against Ukraine were “transparently false.” NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said that the allies “reject the allegation” and believe that Russia “must not use it as a pretext” for further escalation.

 ISLAMABAD - Ambassador of Denmark, Jakob Linulf has said that carbon markets are a new opportunity for Pakistan to improve its economic situation and reduce carbon emissions for a green development through sustainable and environment friendly practices.

Climate change was casting adverse impacts on the globe and it was equally important for Pakistan and Denmark to develop strategies for averting its risks to humanity and biodiversity, said Ambassador Jakob Linulf while addressing to the one-day capacity building workshop for journalists on Climate-Smart Reporting: Carbon Market and Equitable Development jointly organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and the Embassy of Denmark here Thursday.

He said Denmark had completed its green transition and transformed its energy sector from a fossil fuel-dependent energy mix to a greener one based on solar, wind, and biomass. “Denmark has faced a lot of challenges in the way and that’s why it wants to share its lessons learnt with Pakistan so that it do not repeat the same mistakes,” he said. The Danish ambassador noted that the Danish companies had adequate technologies to address climate change impacts which can collaborate with their Pakistani counterparts.

“Pakistan is facing double crises; economic crisis coupled with climate change as the 2022 floods inundated one third of the country leaving millions of millions displaced and billions of dollars livestock, infrastructure and ready to harvest crops washed away,” he said. He highlighted that carbon market can be an important tool in developing right and efficient tools to benefit from latest mechanisms to cut carbon emission and address climate change but it should be considered as a financial facility alone. He said the business leaders can take the lead to influence green transition especially in the sectors of steel, fertiliser, and cement where carbon adjustment can be one tool alongwith fuel adjustment and waste management. Soren Lutken, Chief Carbon Market Special UNEP Copenhagen said carbon markets is not the only solution to climate crisis as it was not exactly the idea to reduce but shift the emissions from one place to the other.

He said Pakistan is the host of the cheaper emissions reduction mechanism whereas it was imperative to break the myth that it has missed the train to address Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). He said the country needed to come up with a clear policy framework to decide its moment to enter the compliance carbon markets. “There are cooperations available globally that are interested to buy carbon credits that needs to be explored efficiently with clear policy direction and leadership,” he said. Nadeem Nawaz, Special Advisor and Country Manager at Danish Energy Agency and Global Cooperation provided a brief presentation on the long-term energy planning strategies of Pakistan towards 2050.

He said Pakistan needs to be chalk out a credible roadmap that will lead to tempt more investors in the realm of carbon credits’ training. In his opening remarks, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director, SDPI said journalists can shape public opinion and guide policymakers on adopting efficient carbon markets, whereas the think-tank and media both can benefit from each other’s experiences to reduce carbon emissions. “It is important to highlight the urgency of climate change and the critical nature of the transformative power of carbon markets as South Asia is suffering from many environmental crises,” he said.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Waste recovery is necessary to reduce the increasing quantity of landfill and other forms of rubbish dumping.

Garbage can be transformed into fuel, wood, compost and other materials. Doing this can help to cut contamination, greenhouse gas emissions and landfill use.

The Ljubljana Regional Waste Management Centre (RCERO Ljubljana) is the biggest environmental project in Slovenia, and the most modern facility for waste treatment in Europe.

It is also Slovenia’s biggest cohesion fund environmental project, and a great example of regional cooperation.

Euronews’ Aurora Velez spoke with RCERO Ljubljana’s Founder and Head of Investments and Development, Mjtja Praznik, who created, designed and founded the centre from scratch.

Euronews: How did you come up with the idea for the project?

Mjtja Praznik: Some of the activities started in 2000 when Slovenia was joining the EU: we had to adopt a lot of legislative changes in the field of waste management. Up to that time, most of the municipal waste was thrown into landfill. And this, according to new legislation, needed to stop.

So we thought we needed to treat waste: first, separate it, and then use it for material recycling and energy recovery.

Euronews: What is - according to you- the impact of the project in Slovenia and in Europe?

Mjtja Praznik: Slovenia was treating its municipal waste mainly by landfill, losing all the materials and all the energy. By changing the principle, and by introducing this new treatment for waste, the rate of material being recycled has considerably improved.

We have also replaced some combustibles and energies from the fuel produced in the waste and, last but not least, we have also significantly reduced the amount of waste that is going into landfill. From the new plant, only 2% of the waste goes there: the other 98% is transformed into fuel!

Euronews: How do you feel about having created the project from scratch?

Mjtja Praznik: I am very proud of this project. I had the idea 20 years ago and had started researching the technology then.

I am happy that we were able to use our previous experience from landfill, gas extraction and utilisation. All this knowledge has been key to the project. We have aerobic treatment, anaerobic treatment, mechanical treatment: these are all my babies!

I started with it, and I went through all these phases: preparing, studying, comparing different technologies. And lastly, opting for the finance from the European Commission, because the project was not cheap!

Then it took around three and a half years to get the project ready for operation. I'm happy that it was a long project because it is a big one that can't be done overnight.

 RAMSTEIN AIR BASE - Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised Tuesday that the United States will not let Ukraine fail in fighting off Russia, even as further aid remains stalled in Congress and Kyiv’s forces face shortages of munitions.

The Republican-led House of Representatives has been blocking $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine and the United States has warned that a recent $300 million package would only last a few weeks.

The “United States will not let Ukraine fail”, Austin said at the opening of a meeting in Germany of Ukraine’s international supporters, at which he is seeking to secure further assistance for Kyiv.

“We remain determined to provide Ukraine with the resources that it needs to resist the Kremlin’s aggression,” he said. Washington announced $300 million in assistance for Ukraine last week, but Austin said it was only possible due to savings on recent purchases.

“We were only able to support this much-needed package by identifying some unanticipated contract savings”, Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement the day before that it is “critically important for us that the Congress soon completes all the necessary procedures and makes a final decision” on aid for Kyiv.

Top US military officer General Charles “CQ” Brown told journalists en route to the Ukraine meeting that Kyiv’s troops are “having to pay attention to their supply rates and how they execute.” There is an “incremental kind of back and forth between Ukraine and Russia”, with “incremental gains on both sides”, Brown said.

But he noted that “even as the Russians have gained territory, they do it at a pretty big cost in number of casualties, like in personnel, but also in number of pieces of equipment that are being taken out.”

Austin said in his remarks Tuesday that “Russia has paid a staggering cost for (President Vladimir) Putin’s imperial dreams”, using “up to $211 billion to equip, deploy, maintain, and sustain its imperial aggression against Ukraine.”

“At least 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded” since Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Austin said, adding that Ukraine has also “sunk, destroyed, or damaged some 20 medium-to-large Russian navy vessels.”

The sinkings have been an embarrassment for Moscow and Russian state media confirmed Tuesday that the country had replaced the head of its navy. Austin and other US officials have spearheaded the push for international support for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia invaded and coordinating aid from dozens of countries.

Speaking at the Ramstein US base, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Berlin has offered another half a million euros worth of military aid to Ukraine. “That includes 10,000 rounds of ammunition from the stock of our armed forces,” he told journalists. Germany is Ukraine’s second biggest donor of military support, after Washington, which has committed tens of billions of dollars to aid Kyiv since February 2022.","['URW: Overpraising the West', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Australian Open bans flags from Russia and Belarus on site

Flags from Russia and Belarus were banned from the site of the Australian Open on Tuesday after more than one was brought into the stands by spectators on the first day of the Grand Slam tournament.

Normally, flags can be displayed during matches at Melbourne Park. But Tennis Australia suspended that policy for the two countries involved in the invasion of Ukraine that began nearly a year ago.

“Our initial policy was that fans could bring [flags] in but could not use them to cause disruption,” Tennis Australia said in a statement Tuesday. “Yesterday we had an incident where a flag was placed courtside. We will continue to work with the players and our fans to ensure that this is the best possible environment to enjoy the tennis.”

One Russian flag was displayed during Ukrainian player Kateryna Baindl’s 7-5, 6-7 (8), 6-1 victory over Russian player Kamilla Rakhimova on Court 14 in the first round Monday.

Another was offered to Russian player Daniil Medvedev to autograph after his 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 win over Marcos Giron in Rod Laver Arena on Monday night.

Asked about the new flag ban, Belarusian player Aryna Sabalenka said after her first-round victory Tuesday that she would prefer that politics and sports remain separate but that she understands the decision by Tennis Australia.

Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff each pick up wins in the first round of the Australian Open as they begin their quest for a first Grand Slam title.

“I mean, if everyone feels better this way, then it’s OK,” said Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam semifinalist who is seeded No. 5 at Melbourne Park. “I have zero control on it. What can I say? They did it. OK. No flags? No flags.”

Sabalenka was among the athletes from Russia and Belarus who were barred last year from competing at Wimbledon and team events such as the Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup because of the war in Ukraine. Russia invaded, with help from Belarus, in February.

Dawn Sturgess Inquiry chaired by Lord Anthony Hughes (lead image left). “The war in Ukraine has required”, McGahey (right), a barrister representing the government ministries, wrote to Hughes, “and continues to require work to be undertaken by many of the same individuals and resources who are working on disclosures. Many of those working disclosure are subject matter experts,. While disclosure to the Inquiry is a priority, there have been times when this has had to take second place behind live, ongoing issues of national security.”

McGahey testifed before Hughes at a two-hour hearing on the Novichok allegations in a London courtroom last Friday, November 11. Follow what was said, and what was meant, in this analysis. An official transcript of the hearing can be read here.

According to McGahey, “approximately 80,000 documents (including emails) have been identified and located as relevant” to the Hughes inquiry. But before any of them can be identified, quoted, or released publicly, McGahey suggested, the government’s Ukraine warfighters will be obliged to down their weapons and pick up censorship tools to prevent the Russians from gaining any advantage.

As Hughes has announced, referring to the allegations of Novichok poisoning, “the responsibility for the events in Salisbury [Skripal incident March 4, 2018] and Amesbury [Sturgess incident June 30, 2018] is what is to be decided by this Inquiry. There is, however, at least a prima facie case (denied by those accused) that those responsible were Russian nationals acting in the interests of the Russian state and allegedly under its direction.”

Exactly what roles in the Ukraine war the “subject matter experts” are playing has not been disclosed. The Russian Government has publicly accused the British Government of providing undersea drone and other technology for attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, Russia’s Black Sea fleet, a plan of attack against the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, and nuclear weapons design.

McGahey told Hughes the British Government hasn’t enough money to pay these warfighters to do both the Ukrainian and the Novichok jobs. “There are stretched resources and budgets across HMG [HHis Majesty’s Government], which are not trivial, and there is very real pressure on government departments and agencies.”

Hughes has decided there must be a near-total ban on identifying by name any British official engaged in warmaking against Russia, including intelligence gathering, weapons training, plans and operations.

“The risk of damage to national security here,” he said, ” lies in the risk that hostile actors, whether State or otherwise and, if State, whether Russian or otherwise, might target individuals identified as concerned in the UK reaction to those events, and/or might use access to their names as a means of disrupting UK public functions. I am satisfied, on all the material I have seen, both OPEN and CLOSED, that these are marked real risks to some of those who were involved in the 2018 events, and that Russia in particular has both an interest in such activity and a known capacity to carry it out. For most of these persons therefore, a restriction order is likely to be necessary… [Russia] would have a similar interest in anyone amongst government staff who carried out any sensitive role; an obvious example would be any person concerned in the work of intelligence agencies, or other covert activities, but the risk will not be limited to them. General disclosure of the names of persons subject to these risks would indeed present a hostile actor with a convenient directory of suitable targets and/or a list of sensitive functions which would be of considerable value to a hostile actor accumulating intelligence about UK security and government systems.”

 ""Aren't They Fools?"": Putin Says Ukrainian Statehood Risks 'Irreparable Blow' If War Continues

Russian President Vladimir Putin gave statements on Tuesday which assessed the overall status of the nearly two-year conflict with Ukraine at a moment Western and world leaders meet in Davos for the World Economic Forum (WEF). Zelensky while there in Switzerland pressed Ukraine's case for the need to achieve air superiority.

But Putin in his fresh remarks stressed that not only do Russian forces have the clear upper hand, but he emphasized for the first time that Ukrainian statehood itself risks an ""irreparable"" blow if the war continues. He stressed that Ukraine's military has already ""failed"".

""Not only has their counteroffensive failed, but the initiative is entirely in the hands of the Russian Armed Forces,"" Putin said in the televised remarks. ""If this continues, Ukraine's statehood could be dealt an irreparable, very serious blow,"" he added, but he didn't clarify further precisely what he meant by this.

""They are trying to show that they can also do something. But instead of solving military tasks, they act in such a barbaric way. Attacks are being carried out on peaceful settlements with indiscriminate weapons,"" Putin said in reference to the past several weeks of cross-border attacks on Belgorod city, which have killed and maimed Russian civilians.

Putin further addressed Zelensky's efforts to gather world leaders for a peace summit hosted by Switzerland, to consider Kiev's 10-point peace plan, which it should be noted rejects the possibility of territorial concessions.

""The so-called 'peace formula' that's being talked about in the West and in Ukraine is a continuation of the decree of the Ukrainian president banning negotiations with Russia,"" Putin said, according to a translation in Sputnik.

""As for the negotiating process, it's an attempt to encourage us to abandon the territorial gains we've achieved over the past 1 1/2 years. But this is impossible. Everyone understands that this is impossible,"" the Russian leader continued.

He explained that earlier in the conflict, the two sides were close to serious negotiations that could have led to peace, but that ultimately Zelensky allowed himself to be the puppet of Western powers...

""A day later, they threw all the agreements into the trash, and now they are saying publicly—including the head of the Ukrainian negotiating group—that 'Yes, we were ready, but we missed the chance, because then-Prime Minister of Britain Mr. [Boris] Johnson came and persuaded us not to implement these agreements,'"" Putin said.

He stressed: ""Fools, are they not? They're admitting directly that if they had gone for it, everything could have been ended a long time ago, 1 1/2 years ago.""

Lately, Ukraine has been seeking to get China involved in getting on board with its peace formula. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak on Sunday said, ""China needs to be involved in talks to end the war with Russia."" He issued the words just ahead of the WEF. China remains the most influential Global South country widely viewed as squarely in Russia's corner, having refused to rebuke Moscow or join Western-led sanctions after two years of the conflict. Kiev hopes to get Global South countries on its side, thus further isolating Moscow - but so far this has proved somewhat futile.","['URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:

The world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.

These “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

There has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”

Last year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.

China is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.

Ukraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.

On October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.

As Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?

To further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.

To retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.

As the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.”

It is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, “What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.”

Biden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.

Not content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.

As the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.

176,EN_CC_100139.txt,"Anglican archbishop lauds Pakistani church's efforts for climate action, interfaith harmony 

 The Archbishop of Canterbury’s Special Representative to the Holy See and Director of the Anglican Centre in Rome, Archbishop Ian Ernest has lauded the Church of Pakistan’s efforts to promote interfaith relations in the country as well as initiating action on the environmental challenges in line with the Lambeth Calls for climate action.

Archbishop Ernest arrived in Pakistan on February 2 on a three-day on the invitation of Church of Pakistan’s President Bishop Dr Azad Marshall. During the visit, the senior church leader held various interactions with faith leaders and community members. He also visited Jaranwala to express solidarity with the victims of the August 16, 2023, violent attacks on multiple churches and homes of Christians.

Speaking to a gathering of interfaith leaders at the Saint Peter’s High School of the Diocese of Raiwand, Archbishop Ernest noted the cordial relations between the clergy of the majority Muslim community and leaders of other faiths. He stressed on the need for continued engagement between the various faith groups for promoting harmony and peaceful coexistence in society.

“It’s encouraging to see such good interfaith relations, which can also contribute greatly towards our common goal of protecting our environment,” said Archbishop Ernest.

The visiting dignitary was awarded a shield by Muslim faith leaders, including former special assistant to the prime minister on interfaith harmony Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi.

The archbishop also participated in a special meeting on climate action organised by the moderator bishop of the Church of Pakistan on Feb 4.

Addressing the participants, Archbishop Ernest lauded the Church of Pakistan’s initiative on climate action, saying he was impressed by the realisation in the church for collaborating with ecumenical partners and faith-based institutions to bring about the much-needed change by raising awareness and collective action.

“I think it’s a God given opportunity for us to be able to change the mentality of our people and to bring about the values of the Kingdom where respect for God’s creation and respect for the other are of crucial importance. Without respecting what God has given us so freely, it would be difficult for us to be instruments of grace in the world,” he said.

Earlier, Bishop Marshall briefed the meeting about the church’s initiatives for fostering partnerships to meet the environmental challenges.

He stressed on inculcating the spirit of stewardship, as embodied by the wisdom of the Christian tradition, to change the mindset towards the natural world.

“Though Pakistan is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, it is unfortunate that our country is also the least funded to effectively combat the crisis.

“We need to act together to protect, restore and safeguard the environment for ourselves and for our future generations,” he emphasised.

Archbishop Ernest and bishops of all dioceses of the Church of Pakistan also participated in the soft-launch of Bishop Marshall’s book titled “The Calling of Lent” at the Lahore College of Theology.

The messages of Archbishop of Canterbury Rt Revd Justin Welby and Anglican Communion’s Secretary General Rt Revd Bishop Anthony Poggo were also shared on the occasion.

In his message, Archbishop Welby said, “Archbishop Azad has taken considerable care to explore some of the spiritual disciplines which might help people journey more closely with Christ to the Cross and prepare for the celebrations of Easter.”

Bishop Poggo, who has written the foreword of the book, stated: “As you study this book during Lent, do please reflect upon the passion of Jesus. Lent is also a season whereby we acknowledge our need for repentance, mercy and forgiveness which is the essence of the message of Jesus Christ’s suffering on the cross.”",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 German bosses, unions jointly oppose boycott of Russian gas

Germany’s employers and unions have joined together in opposing an immediate European Union ban on natural gas imports from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, saying such a move would lead to factory shutdowns and the loss of jobs in the bloc’s largest economy.

“A rapid gas embargo would lead to loss of production, shutdowns, a further de-industrialization and the long-term loss of work positions in Germany,” said Rainer Dulger, chairman of the BDA employer’s group, and Reiner Hoffmann, chairman of the DGB trade union confederation, in a joint statement Monday on Germany’s dpa news agency.

The statement comes as European leaders are discussing possible new energy sanctions against Russian oil, following a decision April 7 to ban Russian coal imports beginning in August. Ukraine’s leaders say revenues from Russia’s energy exports are financing Moscow’s destructive war on Ukraine and must be ended.

That won’t be easy to do. The EU’s 27 nations get around 40% of their natural gas from Russia and around 25% of their oil. Natural gas would be the most difficult do without, energy analysts say, since most of it comes by pipeline from Russia and supplies of liquefied gas, which can be ordered by ship, are limited amid strong demand worldwide.

Germany, a major manufacturing hub and an importer of Russian gas, has so far resisted an immediate shut-off and said it plans to instead phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and most Russian gas imports by mid-2024. The EU’s executive commission has outlined steps to cut the consumption of Russian gas by two-thirds by year’s end through using more pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, importing more liqueifed gas, accelerating the deployment of wind and solar projects and intensifying conservation efforts.

German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said in an interview with the Funke media group that “an immediate gas embargo would endanger social peace in Germany.”

Despite widespread economic sanctions against Russian banks and individuals, the EU continues to send around $850 million a day to Russia for oil and gas, even as EU governments condemn the war in Ukraine. Gas-intensive companies include producers of glass, metals, ceramics and chemicals. Industry officials say in many cases natural gas would be impossible to replace in the short run.

Analysts say Russian crude oil would be easier to replace than gas but that a boycott would still lead to higher energy prices that would hit consumers who are already facing record EU inflation of 7.5%.",['URW: Negative Consequences for the West'],['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
178,EN_CC_200022.txt,"Denmark to Punish Farmers for Cow ‘Emissions’ to ‘Fight Global Warming’ 

 by Frank Bergman, Slay News:

The Danish government has introduced radical new laws that will tax livestock farmers for “emissions” from cows, pigs, and sheep to supposedly “fight global warming.”

Demark has become the first country in the world to introduce a carbon tax that seeks to force farmers to comply with the goals of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) “Net Zero” agenda.

The Scandinavian nation will tax farmers for the so-called “greenhouse gases” allegedly emitted by their livestock from 2030.


Denmark’s globalist leaders claim they are targeting a major source of methane emissions, which they allege is one of the most potent gases contributing to “global warming.”

In order to comply with the WEF’s “Net Zero” targets, Taxation Minister Jeppe Bruus said the aim is to reduce Danish “greenhouse gas emissions” by 70% from 1990 levels by 2030.

As of 2030, Danish livestock farmers will be taxed $43 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030.

The tax will increase to $108 by 2035.

However, because of an income tax deduction of 60%, the actual cost per ton will start at $17.3 and increase to $28 by 2035.

Although carbon dioxide is typically blamed for causing “climate change,” globalists claim that methane traps about 87 times more heat on a 20-year timescale.

However, as Slay News has previously reported, top scientists have debunked these claims as a hoax.

A recent peer-reviewed study provided conclusive scientific evidence proving that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Earth’s atmosphere cannot cause “global warming.”

Dr. Jan Kubicki led a group of world-renowned Polish scientists to study the impact of increases in CO2 emissions on the Earth’s global temperatures.

However, not only did they find that higher levels of CO2 made no difference, but they also proved that it simply isn’t possible for increases in carbon dioxide to cause temperatures to rise.

Kubicki and his team recently published three papers which all conclude that Earth’s atmosphere is already “saturated” with carbon dioxide.

This saturation means that, even at greatly increased levels of CO2, the “greenhouse gas” will not cause temperatures to rise.

Nevertheless, unelected globalists at the United Nations Environment Program claim that livestock accounts for about 32% of “human-caused methane emissions.”

“We will take a big step closer in becoming climate neutral in 2045,” Bruus said.","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Methodologies/metrics used are unreliable/faulty', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Greenhouse effect/carbon dioxide do not drive climate change', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities']",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Zelensky Exposed: Former Advisor Reveals How Ukrainian President Thinks He's Omnipotent

Authored by Grzegorz Adamczyk via Remix News,

The arrogance of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is causing problems with Kyiv’s allies and he believes that, as his country is at war, he can do anything, his former adviser has claimed.

In a bombshell interview with Polish news outlet dorzeczy.pl, Oleksyi Arestovych slammed his former boss for his increasingly overbearing behavior and believes he has fallen victim to delusions of grandeur and a belief that he is all-powerful.

Arestovych cited Zelensky’s response to the ongoing diplomatic conflict over the dumping of Ukrainian grain as an example, accusing the president’s office of “behaving as if it has a decisive voice in the European Union rather than being a country aspiring to join the bloc.”

The former adviser, who himself is a possible candidate in any future Ukrainian presidential election, expressed his fear that Zelensky “has become deluded into thinking he now rules the globe.”

His diplomacy concentrates on making demands and using moral blackmail to claim Ukraine is fighting for the West, said Arestovych, who claimed this tactic may have been successful at the beginning of the conflict but is no longer effective.

“The West is increasingly irritated by Ukraine’s arrogance,” he added.

Arestovych claimed that Zelensky’s behavior had led to tension among Kyiv’s closest allies including Poland and Romania, while its relations with the U.S. and the U.K. have also cooled.

The West will continue to support Ukraine because it is in the West’s own interests to do so, but it may well stop supporting the current Ukrainian government and back an alternative, he warned.

However, Arestovych was dismissive of the argument that Ukraine was colluding with Germany against Poland, claiming that this is only purely due to the fact that Ukraine has no clear foreign policy under Zelensky.

Ukraine wants Germany to be a counter-balance to Russia and that is why Ukraine backs its ambitions of securing a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, the former advisor told the Polish news outlet.

Arestovych admitted that Poland could have gotten more out of Ukraine on issues related to the Volhynia massacre by pursuing a more transactional policy towards the country, but that would not have been beneficial to it in the longer term. “Even if Zelensky is ungrateful for all the help selflessly offered by Poland, Ukrainian people are grateful and that will be more important in the longer term,” he assured.

Highlighted in a recent report by The World Financial Review. “Malik Riaz, Asia’s largest real estate developer, has set an example that might inspire other Pakistani entrepreneurs to step forward and address the needs of an increasingly low-income population” says the report.

Malik Riaz and Bahria Town’s commitment to addressing hunger and poverty in Pakistan through initiatives like Bahria Dastarkhwan has garnered significant praise. Some globally well-known newspapers i.e. News Week, CNN, Los Angeles Times, EuroAsia Industry and The National already have recognized Malik Riaz Hussain and Bahria Town’s social welfare initiatives. The article statEs that in a country where economic challenges persist and government resources are stretched thin, Bahria Town has stepped up to fill critical gaps in social welfare. From providing free meals to hundreds of thousands through Bahria Dastarkhwan to mobilizing rescue teams during natural disasters, Bahria Town’s efforts have touched the lives of millions.

Furthermore, the article reads as Malik Riaz’s belief in mutual prosperity drives such philanthropic initiatives, aimed at improving the lives of ordinary Pakistanis. While recognizing the limitations of private initiatives, Bahria Town remain hopeful for increased government support to amplify its impact further. Moreover, the report asserts that as climate change exacerbates challenges in Pakistan, Bahria Town remains steadfast in its commitment to serving communities in need. Bahria Town’s relief operations during the 2022 floods underscore its dedication to humanitarian causes. The global acknowledgment of Bahria Town and Malik Riaz’s efforts underscores the pivotal role of the private sector in addressing societal challenges.

This type of bilateral cooperation has set a good example for the EU by adhering to the principle of mutual benefit and addressing differences through dialogue and consultation, experts said.

On Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian announced that Séjourné will pay a visit to China on Monday at the invitation of Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi.

During Séjourné's visit, the two countries are expected to focus on bilateral economic and trade relations, solving problems encountered in cooperation, and creating a better business environment for enterprises of both sides, Cong Yi, a professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Sunday.

In addition, they may strengthen communication and cooperation in international affairs and jointly address global challenges such as climate change and public health, Cong noted.

This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. France will be the guest country of honor at the China International Fair for Trade in Services 2024 and the seventh China International Import Expo.

Over the past six decades, the two countries have adhered to mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, with economic and trade cooperation becoming increasingly closer, experts noted.

""China and France eye faster growth in traditional areas including agricultural products, aviation and civilian nuclear power,"" Cong said.

Under the mechanism ""from French farms to Chinese tables,"" the two countries have reaped fruitful achievements in agricultural products.

As an important source of China's agricultural and food imports, France is China's top agricultural import market and second-largest agricultural trading partner in the EU.

For many years, France has been the largest supplier of bottled still and sparkling wines to China. According to the China Association for Imports and Export of Wines and Spirits, China's wine imports in 2022 amounted to about $1.43 billion, with an import volume of 335,300 kiloliters, of which three countries - France, Chile and Italy - accounted for nearly 80 percent.

In 2022, France's wine exports to China totaled $661.9 million.

In addition, France was the first Western country to sign an air transportation agreement with China and the first Western country to cooperate with China in civilian nuclear energy, according to new.china.com.

""The digital economy will become an important area of economic and trade cooperation between China and France. The two sides can launch in-depth collaboration in artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and other fields,"" Cong said.

The two countries also have extensive room for cooperation in the field of clean energy, and they can jointly develop and promote new-energy technologies to help transform the global energy structure, he noted.

Moreover, cooperation between China and France in the fields of the economy, trade, science and technology has demonstrated the broad prospects and great potential of China-EU cooperation, which has helped to enhance the confidence of both sides in cooperation between China and Europe, Cong said.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 VLADIMIR Putin was spotted with a mystery ""prominent scar"" on his neck that has led to swirling rumours the despot is amid a ""thyroid cancer battle"".

Intrigue over the Russian leader's health resurfaced following photos that were snapped at an Orthodox Easter cathedral service in Moscow at the weekend.

Images showed stone-faced Putin clasping a candle as the church proceedings went on.

However, most strikingly was an evident ""scar"" on his neck.

It prompted a debate online about whether the new snaps stack up the claims made by Proekt media, who have said Putin is suffering from thyroid cancer.

The independent outlet spearheaded an investigation that revealed the dictator was constantly accompanied by a team of surgeons.

One in particular, Yevgeny Selivanov, who specialises in thyroid cancer.

The scar appears as a prominent diagonal line upwards from left to right on his neck.

It was clearly seen in the pictures posted by the Kremlin from the Easter service.

Telegram channel, Unian, claimed the scar was the shape of a letter 'Z', a pro-war symbol used by Putin’s invading forces.

Most read in The Sun

An Unian spokesman said: ""A strange scar in the shape of the letter 'Z' has been noticed on Putin's neck.

""The unusual shots were taken on Easter when the dictator visited a cathedral.""

Denis Kazaksky, a Ukrainian blogger, also pointed to the ""prominent scar"" in one of his social media videos.

He said: ""What is it with Volodya [Putin]?

""I think I have figured out where the 'Z' came from.""

It is not the first time Putin's apparent scar has come to light.

In December 2020, Russian media outlet Sobesednik identified a distinct marking on his neck.

At the time, plastic surgeon Amjad Al-Yousef said: ""In theory, after intubation such a scar can remain, but this is only in theory.

""It often happens that not even a scar remains as the skin heals.""

He was speaking before suspicious claims emerged that Putin suffered from thyroid cancer.

However, there is no evidence the despot leader has ever undergone surgery for removal of the thyroid gland.

Al-Yousef claimed it could possibly not be a scar but a mark in his loose skin - common in an ""elderly person"".

Conversely in 2020, the marking did not appear as prominent as seen in recent days at the Christ the Saviour Cathedral in Moscow.

Al-Yousef suggested Putin, 70, had undergone regular plastic surgery on his face - but this was not done on his neck.

He said: ""No plastic surgery is performed on this part of the body.

""Even if we assume that this is some kind of innovation in plastic surgery, then in this case it would have been performed more professionally without such a serious mistake.""

Pointing to a photo of Putin from 2020, Al-Yousef clarified the differences in appearance.

He said: ""Here is the classic neck of a 68 year old man with low skin strength.

“With age, skin turgor changes and becomes weaker.

""Vladimir Putin’s face is very well-groomed, professional cosmetic care is noticeable.

""And when we see the perfect face, we naturally begin to pay attention to the skin of the neck.

""Unfortunately, there are no such effective professional treatments for the neck.

""While putting a shirt and a tie on, the throat is squeezed, the skin gathers and turns into such a fold.""

The Proekt investigative report claimed one medic Alexey Shcheglov ""relentlessly"" followed the Russian leader and had made 59 trips encompassing 282 days by his side.

According to the report, Shcheglov was seen as a medic ""who, among other things, can be the first to detect problems with the thyroid gland, including oncological ones.""

Putin was also under the attention of Igor Esakov, an ENT specialist, who made 38 trips to Putin, covering 152 days.

He was also accompanied by Yevgeny Selivanov, a cancer surgeon - during 35 trips, it was reported.

His expertise covers ""peculiarities of diagnostics and surgical treatment of elderly and senile patients with thyroid cancer.""

Multiple other medics were revealed as caring for the Russian president.

Separate claims have suggested Putin was undergoing chemotherapy.

One political analyst claimed the warmonger was ""high on speed"" to get through key meetings as he struggles with health issues.

 by Tom Luongo, Tom Luongo:

“The Vorlons say, understanding is a three-edged sword: your side, their side, and the truth”

— John Sheridan, Babylon 5

The biggest media story of 2024 so far has come and gone. Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin last week.

Everyone, even the Davos/UK dominated media, has put forth their opinion on it. I gave out a quick take for my Patrons the morning after just like everyone else. And like everyone else I missed the biggest takeaway from this interview.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Now, if you go through the commentary what you will mostly see is people, as always, doing what traders call “talking their book.” In other words, as opposed to dealing with the information presented and the motivations of the people involved, most media outlets and commentators put forth their opinion on whether this interview satisfied their needs from it.

So, for the hardcore geopolitical types and armchair psychoanalysts, we heard a lot of opinions second-guessing Putin’s strategy to open the interview with a nearly thirty minute recitation of Russian/Ukrainian history. Why would he do this, was the common refrain.

I’ll use my former-bellwether-for-normies, Scott Adams, as an example of this.

How many of you thought Putin was “all there” in the Tucker interview?

If he seemed lucid to you, it’s because Biden is your comparison.

I thought Putin seemed unhinged. The history lesson was not a good sign. https://t.co/VZiEIHRZ2t

— Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) February 9, 2024

This was the kindest of the ‘bad takes’ I found on this. But I’m having one of Scott’s “One movie, two screens,” moments here. Because Putin looked anything other than “unhinged.” In fact, he looked as calm as I’ve ever seen him, taking a relaxed posture to put Carlson, who was clearly unsure of where he stood at the beginning of the interview, at ease.

But this is the message that Adams wanted to see, framing Putin in relation to Biden, because he needed something unique to say to justify his even being in the conversation.

By contrast, Martin Armstrong had a great post curating all of the crazy Neocon takes from the “media” on his blog over the weekend.

What’s obvious from those is that they understood that Putin’s 30 minute opening monologue would put off a lot of casual watchers who would tune him out at that point. So, their “analysis” focused on steering the conversation to Putin’s ‘false history’ of Russia and Ukraine.

This way that ‘false history’ would dominate everyone’s opinions the next day, managing the Overton Window of the entire interview, making it all about that. This would be the basis of how they discredit Putin.

Then to discredit Carlson, people like Hillary Clinton was trotted out to lie about Tucker Carlson, calling him a “useful idiot,” and “puppy dog” and a joke in Russian media, which is an outright lie. Hillary’s harpy laugh made an appearance alongside a sycophant interviewer as they joked about Carlson’s having been fired from every legitimate news agency.

We were treated to a common sight: Two Beltway insiders laughing inside their echo chamber and only our sick fascination with roadkill makes it even remotely interesting.

So, the whole exercise is reframed as Puppy Dog Tucker throwing softballs to Liar Putin to distract us away from the sum and substance of their talk.

 The Ukraine War, How the British Derailed Peace

BATTLEFORWORLD.COM | November 25, 2023: Ex-Pentagon analyst revealed that the West refused to support the Ukraine-Russia peace talks and is now seeking a way out.

The leader of the Servant of the People faction in the Ukrainian parliament, Davyd Arakhamia, disclosed that the March 2022 Russian-Ukrainian peace talks was a no go because then UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson brought the negotiations to zero, to have Ukraine continue the conflict. And to pressure the Kiev regime, that was when the “Bucha massacre” appeared at the appropriate time to derailed the peace talks that was ongoing in Turkey.

The Bucha massacre was later debunked by Russia as a hoax, but the damage was already done to smear Russia on the world stage, to which the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson continued along pushing the war stroking the conflict as various countries kept on supplying all sorts of weapons.

According to Arakhamia, the Russians were willing to end the conflict if Ukraine was to agree to neutrality and provide guarantees to not join NATO. Arakhamia referenced an interview he gave to Ukrainian TV channel 1+1, saying: “When we returned from Istanbul, Boris Johnson came to Kiev and said: ‘We won’t sign anything with them at all, and let’s just fight’.”

 Russia will win the special operation in Ukraine if the society shows consolidation and composure to the enemy, President Vladimir Putin said during a visit to the Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant on March 14, Rossiya 24 TV channel said.

Russia is not improving its geopolitical position in Ukraine. Instead, Russia is fighting ""for the survival of Russian statehood, for the future development of the country and our children.""

""In order to bring peace and stability closer, we, of course, need to show the consolidation and composure of our society. When the enemy sees that our society is strong, internally braced up, consolidated, then, without any doubt we will come to reach what we are striving for — both success and victory,"" Putin said.

According to him, many of the current problems began after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when they tried to put pressure on Russia to ""destabilise the internal political situation.” ""Hordes of international terrorists"" new sent to the purpose to accomplish this goal, Putin said.

Afterwards, the West decided to start rehabilitating Nazism in Russia's neighbouring states, including in Ukraine.

Nevertheless, Putin continued, Russia had long tried to build partnerships with both Western countries and Ukraine. However, after 2014, when the West contributed to the coup in Ukraine, the state of affairs changed dramatically. It was then when they started exterminating those who advocated the development of normal relations with Russia, he said.

According to Putin, Russia was forced to launch the special operation to protect the population. Western countries were hoping to break Russia quickly, but they were wrong, he said adding that Russia managed to raise its economic sovereignty since 2022.

 Letters to the Editor: How the U.S. can fight in Ukraine without leading to nuclear war

To the editor: I read the letters to the editor, and there is a clear divide between those who think the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should confront the aggressor, or whether that’s too likely to cause an escalation in the war.

While many people draw parallels between Hitler and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, there is one very clear difference: Putin has nukes.

Nevertheless, while nuclear annihilation is a risk of escalation, appeasement of war criminals has never tamed them. If Putin is allowed to “take” Ukraine, what is to convince him, then, that “taking” Poland is not equally attainable?

At this point, I don’t like any of the alternatives. I think limited, conventional warfare is in order, utilizing lots of conventional high-tech weaponry. The war should not be escalated beyond that, even if Russia uses chemical or biological weapons.

If the Kraken is already released, what choice do we have but to confront it?

Denys Arcuri, Indio

..

To the editor: Letter writers advocating escalating use of force by the U.S. and NATO in Ukraine illustrate how Euro-centric and frankly white-centric our global views are.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is horrific and needs to be addressed forcefully by the U.S. and its allies. But why should the U.S. and NATO engage in armed conflict in the latest global tragedy while ignoring or being responsible for much larger humanitarian disasters of the past few decades, which resulted in much higher fatalities?

Like the invasion of Ukraine, these humanitarian disasters unleashed unthinkable death and destruction on innocent people. Unlike the invasion of Ukraine, they took place in nonwhite and non-European locations.

Few Americans advocated for a global power to intercede and put an end to their suffering.

 Ukraine: You Break It, We Take It

Authored by Citizen Soldier via RealClearDefense,

All Aboard! Here comes the latest Postwar Gravy Train, laden with massive government spending, lax oversight and other goodies for cunning contractors and economic opportunists seeking to benefit from the near-destruction of Ukraine.

Last week, the State Department announced it intends to seize Russian assets in the United States to help fund rebuilding efforts, though the estimated $300 billion here and in Europe won’t cover the projected price tag of $500 billion. “What Putin destroyed, Russia should – must – pay to rebuild,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

Like an earlier generation of interventionists, Blinken cites the “Pottery Barn rule” – You Break It, You Own It – to explain an aggressor’s moral obligation to rebuild. Colin Powell used the same reasoning in the summer of 2002, as a ""caution"" to President George W. Bush about the consequences of military action in Iraq. A major difference is the dollars at stake. American and European firms undoubtedly are eager to reconstruct a modern, high-tech country from the ground up.

Our government seeks every opportunity to impose itself, at home and abroad, but has a poor track record for managing projects.

No-bid contract awards, bribes and billions of missing dollars are the legacy of the Coalition Provisional Authority’s rebuilding work in Iraq, where officials concluded that not enough was accomplished for the amount of funds expended. We learned that when taxpayer money is plentiful, oversight and results will be negligible. Just imagine how generous and hands-off our government might be spending Russia’s money.

Not everyone endorses the act of confiscating Russia’s money, pointing to the principle of reciprocity as a reason to show restraint. “Stealing” the assets of a foreign country sets a dangerous precedent that could be applied against us. For example, what if China confiscates American assets to fund rebuilding projects in Libya, Iraq or other nations the United States has damaged through war?

The DC hype-meisters talk about the Great Power Competition of wannabe superpowers; they tell us that China is on the brink of becoming the dominant international force, that Russia is preparing to seize all of Europe. Here, though, the façade falls away—the elites believe the United States has no economic or military peers. When you’re as rich and mighty as America, there’s no fear of reciprocity.

The elites will do what’s in the immediate best interest of their friends, which include certain corporations and investors who will benefit from the most extensive international project since World War II. For this group, the only morality is a morality of power: Treating other nations the way you want to be treated is a rule for losers and weaker players.

Blinken and the politicians talk about our categorical imperative in Ukraine, how the world relies on America to “defend democracy” and “protect the rules-based order.” But their words ring hollow. The cynical truth is that what Russia breaks, America will take—using confiscated money to fund a massive rebuilding project that will be poorly managed, but lucrative for the chosen few involved.

 Russia on Monday said that there is currently “no basis” to hold an arms control and strategic stability dialogue with the US amid the ongoing war between Moscow and Kyiv.

“There is no basis whatsoever for an arms control and strategic stability dialogue with the United States in the face of a total hybrid war being waged against our country … It will be possible to discuss these topics only after the US authorities renounce their openly hostile anti-Russian policy,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a video address to the Moscow Nonproliferation Conference.

Lavrov expressed that efforts to reduce the potential of a conflict between Russia and the US should be “comprehensive in nature” and based on removing NATO’s eastward expansion.

He further said the West is balancing on the “dangerous edge” of a direct military confrontation between nuclear powers, indicating that Moscow is especially concerned that the three nuclear powers in the West are among Ukraine’s main supporters.

“The US-led ‘collective West’ is cynically complementing the deliberate destruction of balanced and equal agreements that do not suit Washington with the promotion of apparently dishonest schemes that would create advantages for the United States,” Lavrov also said.

He argued that the West’s goal is to create a “unilateral military advantage for themselves by setting new limits for nuclear arsenals while formalizing the aggregate Western superiority in the sphere of non-nuclear capabilities,” adding that the US and its allies are enlarging their network of alliances “directed against third countries” to achieve military superiority.

Lavrov went on to say that Russia’s move to revoke the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year was a “logical response to the destructive moves by the US and other Western countries.”

“That said, we remain a full-fledged party to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Not so long ago, we completed the formation of our segment of the International Monitoring System. We are ready to return to the issue of its ratification as soon as the US does this,” he said.

The Russian foreign minister also accused the Western countries of “tailoring” the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to their interests.

“We are convinced that to prevent further degradation of the world situation, maintain durable stability and create realistic disarmament, all countries should pool their efforts to upgrade the international security system relying on the principles of multilateralism, equality and indivisibility. This is the only way of reducing interstate conflicts and ensuring real progress in arms control,” he said.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
189,EN_UA_102953.txt,"Russian celebrities labelled as 'foreign agents' for supporting Ukraine challenge Putin in court 

 A Moscow court on Monday disclosed that several Russian artists, who were labeled as “foreign agents” for publically supporting the Ukrainian government, have submitted appeals against the tagging.

According to the Zamoskvorechye district court, appeals have been filed by TV host and comedian Maksim Galkin, actor and musician Semyon Slepakov, blogger Ilya Varlamov, and singer Zemfira.

All four individuals left Russia last year and were branded as foreign agents following their public statements in favour of Kiev.

Galkin, who was designated as a foreign agent in September 2022 for engaging in “political activities” on behalf of a foreign government, appeared in a video where he was heard chanting slogans of Ukrainian nationalists during a concert in Dubai, which surfaced in January.

Galkin, a comedian known for hosting Russia’s version of the quiz show ‘Who Wants to Be a Millionaire’ from 2001 to 2008, had performed alongside Ukraine’s future President Vladimir Zelensky in a New Year’s Eve special in 2013.

Galkin, aged 46, and his wife, 73-year-old Soviet pop icon Alla Pugacheva, fled to Israel during the escalation of the Ukraine conflict.

Pugacheva condemned Galkin’s designation and expressed her demand to be included on the list as well.

Last week, Zemfira, a rock musician who rose to fame in the early 2000s, submitted her appeal to the court, according to reports.

Born as Zemfira Ramazanova, she was added to the foreign agent list in February 2023 after criticizing the “war in Ukraine” and relocating to France.

Towards the end of March, Varlamov’s inclusion in the registry was announced.

As per the Russian Ministry of Justice, the architect and video-blogger specializing in urbanism was accused of spreading false information about government policies and receiving support from foreign entities.

Notably, Varlamov had already departed from Russia by that time and claimed to have obtained a passport from Turkmenistan.

On April 14, Slepakov was designated as a foreign agent.

The Justice Ministry justified this decision by citing his receipt of support from foreign sources, his opposition to the special military operation in Ukraine, and his involvement in promoting negative sentiments towards the Russian people, military, and government.

In a satirical song released in January, Slepakov portrayed a Russian mother expressing grief over her three-year-old child not being able to participate in warfare.

The TV comedian, screenwriter, and producer had relocated to Israel before his designation.

The foreign agents law, enacted in late 2012, allows for the identification of Russian individuals and nonprofit organizations engaged in political activities and receiving funding from abroad.

Although it does not impose civil or criminal penalties, unlike its U.S. counterpart that served as its model, those labeled as foreign agents are burdened with demanding reporting obligations.

190,EN_UA_102990.txt,"At Last, a Credible Explanation of How Kakhovka Dam Was Blown Up 

 by Eric Zuesse, The Duran:

Though Western ‘news’ media have gotten their ‘explanation’ of this event from Ukraine’s Government, it never made sense that Russia would have wanted to flood, harm, and weaken, the entire western half of the territory that Russia now controls in the former Ukraine, including in Crimea (which was getting its water-supply from that dam).

The anonymous author of the “Moon of Alabama” website has a long and almost flawless record of accurately exposing realities that mainstream U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media had been hiding, and the latest such is his June 13th “Did Russia Destroy The Nova Kakhovka Dam?” His report there turns upside-down and inside-out the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ that the dam had been bombed not by a missile, but by an explosive device which had been placed there by saboteurs whom Ukraine’s Government assumes were from Russia. U.S.-Government-approved ‘news’-media accept and amplify that assumption, but “MoA” does not.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

First, he quotes the New York Times and other U.S. Government mouthpieces presenting the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ of the blow-up; and then he rips it apart by noting the extremely relevant (but in U.S.-and-occupied lands ignored) fact, that on May 12th, Britain had supplied to Ukraine its “Storm Shadow” missiles that are designed to have a two-stage bombing-operation: first, a normal surface bomb, but then after it a fuse-ignited ground-penetrating bomb to explode deeper inside even a fortified and hardened underground target such as that dam was apparently blown up.

The British-supplied Storm Shadow weapon is perfect for this type of destruction — exploding from deep underground, instead of from the surface. And whereas Russia doesn’t have any Storm Shadows, Ukraine definitely does — ever since May 12th.

The present news-report about U.S.-and-allied lies is being simultaneously submitted for publication by all of the standard U.S.-Government mouthpiece propaganda-media, just in case any of them might finally want to go beyond their standard U.S.-Government-approved sources.

Ever since at least late 2022, Russia has been warning that Ukraine’s government wants to blow up that dam. For example, on 1 November 2022, Reuters headlined “Russia announces wider evacuation of occupied southern Ukraine”, and reported that,

“Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded,” Vladimir Saldo, Russian-installed head of occupied Kherson province, said in a video message.

“Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 km from the Dnipro,” he said. “The decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians.”

Moscow has accused Kyiv of planning to use a so-called “dirty bomb” to spread radiation, or to blow up a dam to flood towns and villages in Kherson province. Kyiv says accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. …

Saldo, the Russian-imposed occupation leader for the province, identified seven towns on the east bank that would now be evacuated, comprising the main populated settlements along that stretch of the river.

Even U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media occasionally report relevant facts when they find them useful to mention in a ‘news’-report that has an anti-Russian “spin.”

So: we know that Russia’s Government was trying to protect the residents in that region against this attack, but U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media have unquestioningly accepted the Ukrainian government’s accusation that Russia’s Government did it. And, now, an extremely likely explanation has finally been provided, which implicates both Ukraine’s government and UK’s Government as having done it.","['URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

 NATO Troops Are Operating In Ukraine Disguised As Mercenaries, Russian General Claims

By Magyar Nemzet of Remix News

A Russian general is claiming that NATO troops are in Ukraine, but they are being disguised as mercenaries to justify their presence, with a number of American and Polish bodies found in Avdiivka, the city recently captured by Russian forces over the last few days.

In an interview with Russian newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, General Sergei Rudskoy, chief operations director of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said that NATO military personnel are taking part in the fighting in Ukraine disguised as mercenaries.

“NATO soldiers are taking part in the fighting disguised as mercenaries. They control air defense systems for operational and tactical missiles and multiple rocket launchers, and are part of assault teams,” Rudskoy said. According to him, NATO officers directly shape the military operations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

The Russian state news agency TASS reported that the bodies of soldiers with Polish and American insignia on their clothes had been found in the Russian-controlled Avdiivka.

“The clearing of Avdiivka has revealed quite a few interesting details. In this case, bodies abandoned by Ukrainian armed units with American and Polish insignia sewn on their uniforms,” Igor Kimakovsky, an adviser to the head of the “Donetsk People’s Republic,” told Russia’s TASS/TRANS news agency.

This information cannot be independently verified.

Gen. Rudskoy claims that Ukraine is being used as a proxy against Russia.

“Western countries make no secret of their desire to inflict a strategic defeat on our country. In order to achieve this goal, Washington and Brussels have chosen Ukraine, where anti-Russian, nationalist sentiment has been nurtured since the collapse of the Soviet Union. At present, the Ukrainian people are being used by the United States as cannon fodder for its geopolitical ambitions of world domination. Therefore, the threats to our country today are no less serious than in the years of 1941-1945 last century,” said Gen. Rudskoy.

With the fall of Avdiivka, Ukraine has lost one of the most important cities on the Donetsk frontline, Many believe that the town is now serving as a second Bakhmut, as it was clear months ago that it could only be held temporarily at the cost of tens of thousands of soldiers’ lives.

 4th International Conference on SIDS: Transforming SIDS Economies through Energy Transition and Climate Action towards Prosperity, Resilience and Sustainable Development

Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have emerged as frontrunners in the global fight against climate change. The island states have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the principles outlined in the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A pivotal aspect of their dedication lies in the ambitious targets set to transition towards resilient renewable energy systems, thereby reducing fossil fuel dependency, enhancing economic resilience, and addressing pressing socio-economic challenges. The realization of SIDS' renewable energy commitments hinges upon robust partnerships with financing institutions, development partners, and relevant stakeholders for providing financial assistance, technology transfer, and capacity-building support. Collaborative efforts are vital to bolstering SIDS' resilience and prosperity through energy sector transformation.

IRENA through the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative aims to convene SIDS representatives, development partners, regional and multilateral organizations, financing institutions, and other stakeholders. Through strategic deliberations, the event sought to identify innovative financing mechanisms, facilitate technology transfer, and outline capacity-building initiatives crucial for SIDS to achieve their renewable energy commitments.

Furthermore, the key discussion points during the side event took into consideration the following aspects:

- Exploring innovative financing mechanisms tailored to the unique challenges faced by SIDS.

- Facilitating technology transfer and knowledge sharing to accelerate renewable energy adoption.

- Identifying capacity-building needs and strategies to enhance SIDS' resilience and expertise in renewable energy development.

- Fostering partnerships and collaborations to mobilize resources and support SIDS' energy transition efforts.

The expected outcomes of the side event gauged how the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative and similar SIDS focussed initiatives can facilitate:

- Enhanced understanding of the financing landscape and available mechanisms for supporting SIDS' renewable energy projects.

- Concrete strategies and action plans for facilitating technology transfer and capacity-building initiatives in SIDS.

- Strengthened partnerships and commitments towards advancing renewable energy transformation in SIDS.

- A roadmap for continued collaboration and support to ensure the realization of SIDS' renewable energy commitments.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Moscow: Russia will ask the UN Security Council for an investigation into Nord Stream gas pipelines explosions in September last year for which it blames the US.

The Russian parliament’s committee for international relations has introduced the motion regarding this and is expected to get approval by the State Duma later this week.

What does the proposal say?

According to a report by TASS, the proposal calls the Baltic Sea pipelines blasts as “an act of international terrorism” and a “monstrous sabotage.""

It seeks from the United Nations to hold accountable both - who gave the order for the explosions and those who carried it out.

“The criminal act has threatened the security of all Eurasia,” the proposal stated.

Giving the reference to the report of American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, the lawmakers blamed US President Joe Biden’s administration, saying it “gave the illegal order and bears full responsibility for the multi-billion-dollar damage to the infrastructure of Russia, Germany, France and the Netherlands.""

Don’t Miss: US planted explosives along Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022 under Biden supervision, claims Seymour Hersh

They further described the pipeline sabotage as inflicting long-term damage to the security, economy and environment of the entire region.

Hersh in his report alleged that the Nord Stream gas pipelines were damaged in a joint operation between the US and Norway.

US actions require “a thorough international investigation, punishment of those responsible and compensation for the damage caused,” the proposal said.

What Seymour Hersh’s report say?

Last week, Hersh in over 5,000 words report claimed that “top secret and highly-dangerous operation” was carried out by the divers during BALTOPS22, a series of military exercises in the Baltic Sea carried out by 16 NATO countries.

According to him, divers trained at the US Navy’s Diving and Salvage Centre in Florida, planted C4 explosives on three Nord Stream pipelines in June 2022. They were detonated after three months using a sonar buoy which broadcast a signal that triggered the bombs.

He further claimed that the Nord Stream attack was carried out in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

Explosions in Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were reported on 26 September, 2022, an attack that, ostensibly, continues to puzzle investigators.

 Facebook now warns users NOT to ‘call for Putin assassination’ after controversial rule change

FACEBOOK users are now banned from calling for violence against heads of state.

Meta – the parent company of Facebook and Instagram – on Sunday clarified its recent violent speech policy to specifically not include calls for the death of a head of state.

The new announcement by Meta is likely in response to the violent posts users have been sharing towards Russian President Vladimir Putin following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""We do not permit calls to assassinate a head of state… So, in order to remove any ambiguity about our stance, we are further narrowing our guidance to make explicit that we are not allowing calls for the death of a head of state on our platforms,"" Meta global affairs President Nick Clegg said, per Reuters.

Meta's clarification came shortly after the company revealed last week that it would take a more relaxed stance on users calling for violence against Russian forces in the context of the Ukraine invasion.

""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech,"" a Meta spokesperson said.

However, it appears that Meta's initial policy sparked confusion among both Facebook and Instagram users on what type of speech is exactly permitted.

Along with banning violent calls against state leaders, the American tech company also emphasized that their new policy does not allow for hate speech towards Russian civilians.

""We are now narrowing the focus to make it explicitly clear in the guidance that it is never to be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general,"" Clegg said.

""Meta stands against Russophobia. We have no tolerance for calls for genocide, ethnic cleansing, or any kind of discrimination, harassment, or violence towards Russians on our platform,"" Clegg added.

Last Friday, the Kremlin opened a court case against Meta in direct retaliation to the social media giant's violent speech policy.

""A criminal case has been initiated … in connection with illegal calls for murder and violence against citizens of the Russian Federation by employees of the American company Meta,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said, according to Reuters.

The Russian prosecutor general's office asked a court to designate Meta an ""extremist organization"" and ban it from operating in the country after the social media giant changed its hate speech rules on Friday, per the Wall Street Journal.

The prosecutor's office added that Meta's actions not only constitute terrorist activity but also incite ""hatred and enmity"" towards Russian citizens.

Several weeks ago, Russia also announced that it would block civilians' access to Facebook and since then the media platform has been heavily restricted.

 Another day, another fatuous ‘fact’ check from Reuters. This time the news agency accuses the Daily Sceptic of “cherry-picking” Arctic sea ice extent data to provide a “misleading” story. Being accused of “cherry picking” by an outfit that funds a course for journalists that encourages them to pick a fruit such as a mango and discuss why it isn’t as tasty as the year before due to climate change is beyond ridicule. Taking lectures on responsible journalism from a Net Zero-obsessed operation that has promoted a course speaker who has suggested “fines and imprisonments” for expressing scepticism about “well supported” science is laughable, if also a tad sinister.

One of the activists called to admonish the Daily Sceptic with a ‘straw man’ argument was Walt Meier, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, who said: “Comparing two specific years is not an indicator for or against long-term changes”. The Daily Sceptic did not do that. Interestingly, this would appear to be the same Walt Meier whose comments on ”mind blowing” low winter levels of Antarctica sea ice last year made headlines around the world. Meier claimed at the time that it was “outside anything we have seen”. Happily, the Daily Sceptic was able to remind Meier that he had been part of a team a decade ago that cracked open the secrets of early Nimbus weather satellites and found a similar sea ice low in 1966. At the time, Meier commented that the Nimbus data show there is variability in Antarctica sea ice “that’s larger than any we have seen” since 1979.

Which parts of Ukraine has Russia invaded?

Russia has made large sweeps in the south of Ukraine, using Crimea and the separatist supporters in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Troops moved into the Kherson region from Crimea - a territory that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Kherson and Melitopol areas of Ukraine are under control of Russian forces.

There is strong Russian presence in Chernobyl and the surrounding area.

Northern cities of Chernihiv and Konotop, which are closest to the Russian and Belarusian borders, have also been taken.

Why has Russia invaded Ukraine?

Unrest in the Donbas region began in 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea.

Pro-Russian demonstrations escalated into fighting with the Ukraine government forces.

The Minsk agreement of 2015 – between the separatist leaders, Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany – sought to end fighting in the region but without success.

The much feared Russian advance began in the early hours on February 21, 2022, soon after Putin announced he recognised Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states in a bombastic TV address.

Joe Biden and Boris Johnson condemned the move as an ""invasion"" and slapped sanctions on Russian banks and Putin's billionaire cronies.

 NEW YORK—An employee of Russian state television who interrupted a live news program to protest the war in Ukraine was released from custody Tuesday and fined about $270, but still could face a prison sentence.

Marina Ovsyannikova told reporters she was not allowed to sleep while held in police custody and that she was interrogated for 14 hours.

Ovsyannikova, an employee of Channel 1, walked behind the presenter during Monday’s evening news show with a poster saying “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.” In English, it said “no war” at the top of the poster and “Russians against the war” at the bottom.

In a video recorded earlier, she urged Russians to join anti-war protests and said that “Russia is the aggressor country and one person, Vladimir Putin, solely bears responsibility for that aggression.”

The state news agency Tass said Ovsyannikova was fined for the video and remains under investigation for the on-air protest under a law banning dissemination of “deliberately false information” about the use of Russian armed forces. The new law carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence.

198,EN_UA_008072.txt,"Putin Mobilizes More Troops, Hints at Nuclear Weapon Use in Conflict Over Ukraine 

 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 21 accused Western powers of engaging in nuclear blackmail and put his country onto an enhanced wartime footing, ordering a partial military mobilization and vowing to use “all means available” in the event of a threat against Russia and its people.

“Those that allow such statements shall be reminded that our country also has various weapons of mass destruction,” including some that are more advanced than those in NATO’s arsenal, he added, according to a translation of his remarks by Sky News.

Accusations Against the WestPutin accused the West of seeking to “weaken, divide and ultimately destroy” Russia, according to an official Kremlin translation of part of his speech, which was posted on the Kremlin website.

Claiming that Western powers had concocted these plans long ago, Putin said they fomented anti-Russia terrorist activity in the Caucasus, moved “NATO’s offensive infrastructure” near his country’s borders, nurtured “hatred for Russia for decades,” and intended to set up Ukraine as an “anti-Russia bridgehead.”

Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian state television that Putin’s mobilization order would encompass reservists but wouldn’t include students or anyone without prior military service.

The Russian leadership has been reluctant to order a broad military mobilization, portraying the invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation” that’s limited in scope.

Putin’s order marks the first time since World War Two that a military mobilization of Russian citizens has been invoked.

Critical ReactionsPutin’s move drew critical reactions from Western leaders and Ukrainian officials.

Bridget Brink, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, took to Twitter to describe Putin’s order as a sign of “weakness” and “failure.”

Britain’s Defense Secretary Ben Wallace was cited by The Scotsman as saying that Putin’s order amounts to an admission of failure.

“Putin’s breaking of his own promises not to mobilize parts of his population and the illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine, are an admission that his invasion is failing,” Wallace said.

“No amount of threats and propaganda can hide the fact that Ukraine is winning the war, the international community are united, and Russia is becoming a pariah,” he added.

 DRAMATIC video shows a tank storming across the border from Ukraine into Russia today as anti-Putin soldiers claimed to have seized villages.

Drones were also reportedly used in the ""invasion"" as explosions rang out along the frontier in the Belgorod region - where the local governor issued a desperate ""don't panic"" message to residents.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, told residents that to ensure safety of citizens in the region, a ""counter-terrorist regime"" has been introduced.

Russian authorities said a ""Ukrainian Army sabotage group"" crossed the border and forces were ""taking measures to eliminate the enemy"".

Ukrainian intelligence said those involved in the incursion were ""solely Russian nationals"".

The provocative move was claimed by the Freedom of Russia Legion, a unit made up of ethnic Russian volunteers and defectors from the Russian army to fight alongside Ukraine.

In an unverified video today, members of the anti-Putin group posed in front of a road sign and an armoured car.

They claimed: ""We have again crossed the border of the Russian Federation. Russia will soon be free.

""The time to fight for the freedom of Russia has come.

""We want our children to grow up in peace and be free people... but that has no place in today's Putin's Russia.""

Armoured vehicles with Ukrainian markings were also spotted near the border, further fuelling rumours of an invasion by pro-Ukraine Russian saboteurs.

Smoke was spotted in multiple locations near border checkpoints in the region, along with videos online appearing to show a Russian soldier dead inside a checkpoint building.

And a helicopter was reportedly seen flying low over houses and deploying anti-missile flares in Rakitnoye, some 30 miles from the Grayvoron border crossing where the tank was spotted.

One post showed a radio message urgently telling Belgorod citizens to evacuate the area.

Governor Gladkov told residents earlier today: ""No one is hurt, the evacuation from Shebensky district is a lie.

""I urge you not to listen to enemies and not to panic.""

In a post on Telegram, the Freedom of Russia Legion shared a photo of a ""free Russia"" flag on a bridge.

They said: ""The first flags of free Russia met the dawn over the liberated cities. Raise the flags in your cities too. Freedom is near!""

The group claimed they had taken control of Kozinka and Gora-Podol villages.

Rumours spread that up to six other villages came under drone and mortar fire.

The flag raised in the photo is the flag used by Russian anti-war protesters - many of whom live in eastern Ukraine - and is also displayed on the Freedom of Russia Legion's Telegram channel.

It describes them as ""free citizens of Russia"" who are fighting against the ""dictatorial regime"" in Russia.

Another video widely shared online appeared to show the soldiers running into the streets of the southern Belgorod region.

This was followed by aerial shots of border towns showing smoke billowing from multiple buildings.

Russian authorities said administrative building in the town of Golovchino was allegedly struck by a drone, and part of a rocket fell into the garden of a home in the village of Antonovka.

Authorities claimed to have full control of the villages and said they were hunting the ""terrorists"" involved in the incursion.

What a surprise - it's hot in July!
For weeks now I've been raving and crying about how hot it is in July. Gloomy climatologists appear on TV and announce grimly that this July is very, very hot. TV submissively falls to its knees before the heat and claims that every year is hotter than the last. But it is not true - the hottest here was in Sadovo in 1916 with 45.2 degrees, when there were not even neo-communists and a green deal.
What happened to the Green Deal? Why did it fade away?/
I personally remember no less heat in July in the late 60's, in the 70's and in August 1986. Then the temperature reached about 42-43 degrees and I felt great.
And now with the apocalyptic (actually idiotic predictions of the neo-communists) I feel great at 39 degrees here. Unfortunately there are fires, but there have ALWAYS been fires in the summer for the last tens of centuries in human memory - on the planet.
Hundreds of scientists claim that the current warming is NOT due to humans, but to an enlarged Sun, to volcanoes warming the world, to powerful ocean currents. Most likely the warming /current winters are dumb jokes/, which is undoubtedly due to natural cycles, and they have nothing to do with human activity.
In the early 1970s, the same ominous prophets of dire climate change of today /or their children/ scared the crap out of people with global cooling and a new ice age!! Today's neo-communists, who deliberately scare people with global warming, do not want this to be remembered, but I remember for a long time! This revealing fact alone is enough to embarrass the warmists, but no one remembers, bothers, or wants to think.
Here's what it's all about: the neo-communists who now command Western Europe and half of America /soon to lose that too/ want to mess with ordinary people and scare them with extreme weather supposedly caused by humans. /Extreme weather exists, but it is NOT caused by people, but by Nature/. The neo-communists in Washington and Brussels know that frightened people with empty pockets from the green deal are the easiest to COMMAND!

208,BG_1163.txt,"EUROPE IS BURNING: Farmers against the green deal!

Farmers' protests across Europe have reached alarming proportions, with blockades springing up in more and more countries on the continent every day. The boom in discontent has a catalyst - the war in Ukraine - but it is only one piece of the puzzle that threatens the livelihoods of producers and the sustenance of us all.
As long as there was no war around the corner, European grain growers, winemakers, butchers, milkmen, honeymakers, and other producers were discontented, but contented themselves with murmuring. This did not seem at all threatening to the rulers in Brussels, who for years have not paid attention to the just demands of those people on whom our table depends and who create a serious part of the gross domestic product.
However, the drop in tariffs on Ukrainian goods because of the war has shown how fragile Europe's single internal market is. The competition, considered unfair, led to a drastic drop in the prices of farm produce. The situation has been further complicated by fuel prices, which the EU has promised to no longer subsidize for farmers. However, it is interesting what the logic was when the commitments under the so-called green deal: how do farmers plow their fields when they don't have oil for their tractors?
Another problem that appears to be major at the moment is the so-called fallow land. These are lands that European producers are obliged to keep unsown for a certain period of time in order for the soil to rest. In return they receive subsidies. Yes, but these subsidies have been eaten up by the accumulated losses due to imports from Ukraine, the spiked fuel prices, natural disasters against which farmers receive too little insurance compensation. And these catastrophes are related to climate change, which is why the infamous green deal is happening.
Thus turns a vicious Paragraph 22, from which there is no way out. And agricultural anger is no less dangerous for Europe than the war in Ukraine or the far-right threat. Because food means security. And the extreme right promises the manufacturers whatever they can to get their votes, and they, the poor people, believe them.
A young farmer from the Netherlands asked the BBC how his cows, which he cares for so hard, are more dangerous with the nitrogen emissions they emit than the trucks that, with their engines running, are parked in a car depot next to his farm. And he is absolutely right. Now, willy-nilly, the EU will make temporary concessions to the farmers' demands, because otherwise Europe will go up in flames with unpredictable consequences.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) are responsible for the death of 192 children and the injuries of 554 children on Russian territory from February 2022 to April 2024. This was stated by the Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations Vasyl Nebenzya at a meeting of the Security Council on June 26 of the World Organization.
The meeting that takes place on this day is dedicated to the protection of children during armed conflicts.
""Kiev regime-controlled armed formations deliberately attack civilian targets: schools, kindergartens, medical facilities. Ukrainian armed forces are responsible for the death of 192 children and the injury of 554 children on the territory of the Russian Federation only for the period from February 2022 to April 2024,” he said.
Kyiv is also responsible for the deaths of 129 minors and the injuries of 503 children in Donbas between 2014 and 2022, Nebenzya added. In addition, he said that in 2023, the Ukrainian armed forces destroyed or damaged more than a thousand medical and educational institutions in Russia.
Earlier, on June 19, the State Duma and the Federation Council approved the report of the parliamentary commission to investigate crimes against minors in Kyiv. At the time, the head of the Federation Council, Valentina Matviyenko, said that the report proved that the Ukrainian leadership had committed criminal acts against children, and called for it to be shared around the world.","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Bombing positions of the Ukrainian armed forces with giant FAB-3000 aerial bombs will overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses. This is written by analyst Brandon J. Weichert in an article for The National Interest.
""If these weapons are mass-produced in Eastern Russia, as Russian media reports, then bombing by these giants against Ukrainian targets will overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses and disrupt its entire air defense strategy,"" the material said.
""The Russians have been striking NATO-provided Ukrainian air defenses for months. This is now beginning to be reflected as the Americans are on the verge of running out of key missiles for their air defense systems. It's so bad, in fact, that the Americans have already told the Israelis and their partners in the Indo-Pacific that all missiles for the US-built air defense systems are now being diverted to Ukraine. So much for the arsenal of democracy. The Russian FAB-3000 is among the largest conventional high-explosive bombs of general purpose in the Russian military.
These bombs cover more area and will be very difficult to take down. If they are being mass-produced in weapons factories in the east, as Russian media suggests, then firing these behemoths at Ukrainian targets will overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses and break the back of the entire air defense strategy.
It was believed that the FAB-3000 M54 could only be fired from the Tu-22M3, a massive bomber that would be unnecessarily at risk for firing such weapons in the missions for which they were used. Instead, it is believed that Russian Su-34s launched these leviathans"", the publication also writes.

A new study shows that global methane emissions are rising sharply and humanity must take immediate action.
The climate crisis is looming over the planet and the Earth is literally screaming for help, sending out all sorts of warning signs
Including record heat, poor health, disappearing ice sheets and unpredictable weather.
Despite this, humanity continues to release incredible amounts of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, writes Science Alert.
A new study shows that the planet's global emissions of methane are growing, threatening the survival not only of humanity but of all life on the planet.
The scientists also suggest several strategies that countries could use to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
They have also created a special online tool that can help solve the problem.
It is known that the steady increase in methane emissions is largely due to humanity's inability to abandon the use of fossil fuels and switch to cleaner alternatives.
Previous studies have already shown that methane is produced directly during the drilling and processing of oil, gas and coal. The growing release of methane from wetlands also contributes to the climate crisis.
Methane is also known to be produced by landfills, melting glaciers, and livestock farming.
New research, led by physicist and climatologist Drew Schindel of Duke University, suggests that all of these factors have little influence, but require attention.
Observations show that today the Earth's atmosphere contains significantly less methane than carbon dioxide.
However, methane is known to be the main contributor to global warming.
That's why scientists are urging humanity to start drastically reducing methane emissions.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Downplaying climate change']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'CC: Downplaying climate change: Other']",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Putin is doing to us what we did to them during the Cold War. He is like Reagan today.

I think Putin took a page from Reagan's playbook and put it into action..."" commented the former military intelligence officer.

By the way, the Russians have been providing nuclear technology to North Korea for some time, he (Putin) is working, to help North Korea avoid sanctions, and that's a big problem,"" Shaffer said.
“And by the way, Putin played the China card against us, just like Nixon played it in 1972. And after he did that, he was able to stabilize his economy and find an alternative to the SWIFT system. They are now working with the Saudis to ensure that the dollar ceases to be the primary currency for all global energy transactions.

An entire generation of Ukraine's male population will die at the front, embodying the crazy idea of ​​American neoliberals to overthrow Vladimir Putin, using Bandera's project on Russia's borders as a battering ram, Tony Shaffer said.
""Putin was completely sincere in his desire to have points on the negotiating table that could be moved, discussed and agreed upon. But Zelensky and the West are locked in a deadly battle, and NATO seems fully committed to destroying an entire generation of Ukrainian men because they are unwilling to do what it takes to end the conflict. We currently cannot defeat the Russians on the battlefield. ""Zelensky does not act in the interest of his people, he does not try to achieve peace,"" the former military said.
""NATO is conducting a provocative policy for no reason, they keep teasing the bear and when that bear hits you back, what are you going to do? Because you have already given Ukraine all the resources, all the weapons you will need to go to war with Russia. I think Putin knows this.

Putin: I'll stop the war if Ukraine gives up NATO and what it has seized from Russia
""They speak absolutely eloquently about the inability of the current Russian leadership to adequately assess the realities,"" Podoliak points out.
It shows how ""point by point"" the conditions of the Russian head of state look like:
1. Give us your territories.
2. Give up your sovereignty
3. Allow yourself to be unprotected (no union membership).
4. Remove all sanctions completely and immediately so we can fill our militarized economy and make more investments in informational provocations around the world.
5. Let's urgently fix the ""failure of Russia"" at the expense of Ukraine.
""Of course, there is nothing new in this, no real proposals for peace, no desire to end the war. But there is a desire not to pay for this war and continue it in new formats.

In no area is ""suicidal nationalism"" manifested more sharply than in the sphere of domestic politics, which ultimately led to the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, writes the American publication American Thinker.
Translated by American Thinker, USA:
After the chaotic collapse of the Soviet Union, Crimea and eastern Ukraine, whose inhabitants are mostly Russian, came under Ukrainian jurisdiction.
Pro-Russian sentiment in these regions, ranging from demands to recognize Russian as an official language to the desire for full autonomy from Ukraine, has taken root in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. These sentiments were further strengthened by the ouster of pro-Russian, democratically elected Ukrainian President Yanukovych in a US-sponsored coup in 2014.
To avoid bloody conflict, Kiev could agree to limited autonomy for the rebel east, similar to the autonomy of the American states.
This part of Ukraine has always wanted this.
But President-elect Petro Poroshenko ignored President Bush's warning not to ""seek independence in order to replace tyranny with local despotism.""
Instead, Kiev decided to use military force to subdue the Russian population of eastern Ukraine.
For years it shelled Donbas, including with American-supplied artillery, destroyed cities and indiscriminately killed thousands of civilians (which the Western media completely ignores).
This ""suicidal nationalism"" became one of the reasons for the accession of Donetsk and Luhansk regions to Russia.
In foreign policy, ""suicidal nationalism"" also took precedence over national interests.
Ukraine's push for NATO membership, ostensibly driven by concerns about its security, has ignored Russia's repeated warnings over the past three decades about the existential threat posed by NATO's eastward expansion.
The desire to become a member of NATO could not guarantee Ukraine's security and would not give it one.
Instead, Ukraine's attempts to break into NATO put it in mortal danger of violating the terms of the 1997 Friendship Treaty between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, which expressly provides for Ukraine's neutrality (Section 6, p. 148).
Ukraine's unwavering pursuit of NATO membership, fueled by political inexperience, recklessness and heavy dependence on foreign aid, was an illusory goal that did not serve national goals and tragically led to avoidable military conflict.
Today, it is already obvious that Ukraine's pursuit of NATO membership is like chasing a mechanical rabbit.
However, Zelensky and company continue to fail to realize that their tireless efforts and sacrifices were in vain, as NATO membership was never an achievable reality.
For obvious reasons, NATO members, unlike Ukraine, want to avoid direct confrontation with Russia.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Almost all political and business leaders in Europe and the Middle East believe that the Ukrainian conflict will end with Ukraine finally ceding some territory to Russia - perhaps Donetsk, Donbas and the southern Black Sea coast to Crimea. From time to time, someone suggests that Russia will be able to occupy the entire territory of the country, writes the American publication The Hill, quoted by ""Focus"".
But none suggests that Ukraine will be able to completely and permanently expel the Russians from Ukrainian territory.
If this is the case, if the most likely outcome in Ukraine is some kind of division of the country, then why are we not now having real discussions about ending the war, the author asks.
France is currently considering sending French troops to the front under the guise of ""advisors."" And the United States has recently openly approved the use of Western weapons against certain limited targets in Russia.
Such actions only increase the risk that the war will go beyond the current limits. But these steps by France and the United States do not increase the probability of a complete victory for Ukraine.
While Western military equipment and logistical support may improve Kiev's capabilities, it clearly lacks manpower. Nothing short of full-scale military intervention by the West can drive the Russians out.
According to The Hill, the situation is simply reaching an impasse.

Tropical diseases will appear in Europe and the United States
Climate change threatens to lead to several million deaths in the coming decades, as well as serious diseases and high costs to health systems, according to a report published today in Davos, Switzerland, BTA reported. The greatest risk is flooding, according to the joint report of the World Economic Forum (WEF, WEF), which is being held this week in Davos, and the consulting firm ""Oliver Wyman"".
The study authors analyzed six key consequences of climate change: floods, droughts, heat, tropical storms, wildfires and sea level rise.
The study is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) average scenario for temperature increase by 2100, which suggests a rise in average temperature of 2.7 degrees Celsius. In that case, according to the study, climate change could cause up to 14.5 million deaths worldwide by 2050. Health systems would have to bear additional costs totaling $1.1 trillion.
According to estimates, floods alone could cause 8.5 million deaths by 2050 - not only directly, but also indirectly through crop damage, an increase in infectious diseases and higher humidity that can lead to respiratory diseases.
The brunt of this is likely to be borne by the Asia-Pacific region with its densely populated coastal regions.
The report's authors expect the second highest death toll, 3.2 million deaths, to be caused by droughts, mainly due to the long-term effects on child mortality of deteriorating water quality and increasingly infertile soils.
According to the report, heat waves could kill an estimated 1.6 million people by 2050, especially among older people.
Warmer temperatures, for example, could lead to a significant spread of mosquitoes, which would make malaria and dengue and Zika fevers more common in Europe and the US.
Overall, however, regions in Africa, the Middle East and Asia will be particularly affected by the health effects of climate change, according to the study.

The Nazis.
This is terrible. This is not taught in school, but there was the so-called eastern hokolost. I have photos of units using Nazi insignia. I posted pictures of Nazis from Ukraine lighting cigarettes from the burning roofs of the Russian houses they set fire to in Kharkiv.
Not all Ukrainians are Nazis. In 2018, there was a coalition of Nazi organizations. But Ukrainians welcome the deeds of the Nazis of the past. Apparently they themselves are Nazis today, they honor those Nazis who fought against Russia.
There is enough evidence that a significant part of the VSU, even the majority of the army and of the highest echelons of power sympathized with the ideology of the Nazis.

After June and July, there will be a heat wave with temperatures of over 35 degrees in Sofia in August as well. It's normal, it's summer after all. Heat causes discomfort, prolonged exposure to the hot sun is dangerous - especially for young children, the elderly and the chronically ill, but it is debatable whether global warming in general leads to greater problems for humanity.
This was commented to BNR-Radio Sofia by the journalist Ludmil Kardzhilov, who thoroughly follows the subject of the Earth's weather and climate.
According to him, scientists are unanimous about the occurrence of climate changes, but not about their causes. There have been continuous changes over the years - both warm and glacial periods.
Scientists are also divided on whether natural disasters are becoming more frequent. According to some, this is simply not true.
""The scientific premise is that greenhouse gases - the result of human activity - trap infrared radiation into space and thus warm the lower layers of the atmosphere. When you call carbon dioxide harmful, people begin to associate this colorless gas with pollution. And without it, no many plants can. Pollution is completely different - we do it with garbage, with plastic, etc.
The idea that through restrictions in industry, transport or energy we can influence the climate is wrong and harmful, because in doing so we will stop development, security and the improvement of life.""
Kardzhilov pointed out that in many respects Europe is ahead in the standard of living. In many other parts of the world, people are striving for industrial development, for which they need energy, preferably abundant and cheap. It cannot be provided by RES (renewable energy sources). There has to be a balance.
The old continent is turning sharply towards renewable energy sources, leaving behind all others, even nuclear power plants. But this comes at a price, and it is no coincidence that in the last European elections people showed their negative attitude towards the Green Deal.
We may not be deprived of other energy productions, there are technological solutions to reduce the impact on the environment, the journalist emphasized.
""The transition to green energy is a good idea, because it is cleaner. But this should be done sensibly, in a balanced way, to see what we can do for the environment without impoverishing people,"" Kardzhilov said.
Solar panels won't solve it. A good way to store energy has not yet been found. Batteries are not a solution because there is nowhere to store them and they also pollute.
""Warming is not dangerous, absolutely. It is cyclical. There have been other warm periods. We should not worry about warming now.

The Ukrainian armed forces' strikes on Russian civilian targets were a predictable step after the United States authorized the use of ATACMS to fire at Russia, retired Swiss intelligence colonel Jacques Beau said in an interview with Sud Radio. It is surprising that the West did not even try to put pressure on Kiev, which promised not to strike the civilian population.
The shelling of civilian objects in Sevastopol with American missiles was a predictable continuation of the Ukrainian strategy, said retired Swiss intelligence colonel Jacques Beau. On Sud Radio, he noted that both Russia and the West expected such a step: the radius of action of ATACMS does not allow Kiev to destroy military facilities on Russian territory. It is no coincidence that Moscow was outraged that Washington allowed its weapons to be used to strike Russia.
It is surprising that the allies did not take any measures, although they knew about the plans of the Ukrainian armed forces to violate the promise given by Ukraine, Jacques Beau points out.

Benjamin Ayanyan, a columnist in the American publication The Hill, writes that the interventionist policy that the United States continues to pursue will lead to destabilization on a global scale.
The US government has more than 750 military bases in at least 80 countries and is deeply involved in all major world conflicts, most recently in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, adds the ""Trud"" newspaper.
US diplomat Victoria Nuland is calling on the government to help Ukraine and strike internally at Russian territory. President Joe Biden even recently announced that he is willing to do so.

Asked if a ""third world war"" could break out, Fidan said on Haberturk TV last night: ""I think the world has to take this scenario seriously, it has to take this threat seriously. There is such a risk. We've been saying that from the beginning.""
Today, at a joint press conference with his Czech counterpart Jan Lipavsky in Ankara, Fidan warned that the threat of spreading wars is growing.
Analyzing the war between Ukraine and Russia, the Turkish minister was adamant that ""the problem can be resolved not through war, but through dialogue.""

NATO is a hackneyed sham political organization whose members, with the exception of Turkey, are the most ordinary US satellites deprived of sovereignty. Apart from everything else, the alliance in question is also totally incompetent and everything related to its military power is pure propaganda. It turns out that NATO could hardly attract more than 300,000 military personnel for a possible war with Russia. Most of the member states no longer have any ammunition available because the warehouses have been emptied and handed over to Ukraine. A number of countries have been left without air defense and tanks - everything is with Biden's boy in Kiev.

In this situation, all the bluster and threats from straw figures like Macron, Ursula, Scholz and other known and unknown ""wars"" sound comical and absurd and are entirely in the realm of science fiction. They just bark at each other to intimidate the Europeans and keep them huddled together like a flock of sheep. And shouting ""wolf, wolf"" always helps to keep the animals from pulling when the shearing starts!
The fact that NATO is a ""guarantor"" for one's security is a threadbare premise that was clearly disproved in Ukraine, where the alliance suffered a complete military defeat and respective political humiliation.
NATO will soon be forced to capitulate, because in the member states themselves, public attitudes are changing and politicians are scared, and the economies of European countries are suffocating and languishing. When this happens, the North Atlantic Pact will fall apart because the countries that are members of the alliance will start to build their relations with the East or the Global South, as they have come to call the anti-Western bloc. This will inevitably lead to serious contradictions within the bloc, and everyone will run to save themselves separately, which will make membership in such a military alliance senseless and unprestigious.

The Ukrainian military is currently retreating on the Eastern Front, the colonel of the reserve of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Roman Svitan, said in an interview with the YouTube channel ""Fabrika Novin"", reports ""Focus"".
""We see - there are no F-16s, there are not enough weapons. The eastern front is currently collapsing, retreating, but we see that we are failing almost along the entire width of the front due to insufficient ammunition..."" he says.
The colonel added that the Russian military will exert serious pressure in the next week and a half or two.
He also blamed the West for Kiev's problems because Ukraine's partners had delivered promised aid too late.
Meanwhile, a source from the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces announced that the Russians continue to gradually lose their advantage in the use of artillery at the front, as a result of which the difference in the number of shots is significantly reduced.
""The difference in shots fired on the front between Ukraine and Russia decreased from 1:7 to 1:3,"" the source told RBC-Ukraine.
Earlier, First Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Gavrilyuk said that at the beginning of this year, the artillery advantage of the Russians was 7:1, but it has been reduced to 1:5.
At the end of winter, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that in order to repel the Russians, the ratio of artillery fire should be 1:3 or 1:1.5.

Megabank JP Morgan has officially left a coalition of investors that is ""focused on pressuring the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters to decarbonize,"" Bloomberg reported.
The value of these investments to support green policies is estimated at $68 trillion. JP Morgan is the largest bank in the US and the largest bank in the world by market capitalization as of 2023.
The news prompted comments that the ""fight"" for decarbonisation was falling apart. JP Morgan said it was leaving Climate Action100+ because it had ""made significant investments in developing its own climate risk engagement framework,"" the financial corporation said in a statement. The bank claims it now has 40 professionals focused on sustainable investing.
And the damage to Climate Action 100+ following JP Morgan's withdrawal may be just beginning. Lance Dial, a Boston-based partner at law firm K&L Gates LLP, told Bloomberg: ""I wouldn't be surprised if we see more defections, especially given that there are costs now, like potential litigation, that weren't there , when the companies have joined'.
The group said its 700+ members are ""committed to managing climate risk and preserving shareholder value through their participation in the initiative"".
The initiative, along with its participants, has faced growing criticism from Republican circles in the US, calling it politically motivated.
That criticism has led many investment firms to back away from publicly aligning with net-zero emissions commitments and to play down their involvement in climate-focused financial groups, now seen as more of a political burden than a merit.
Climate Action 100+ is now entering a more proactive phase, requiring its members to ensure that companies move from plans to tangible emissions reductions.

Warsaw is trying to take the reins of a new kind of regional leadership, replacing Germany as the geopolitical spearhead.

According to the publication, during the Lennart Meri conference on foreign policy and security held in Tallinn, representatives of the Baltic countries warned German government officials about the potential consequences of Western policy towards the war in Ukraine.
Such a development could turn NATO into a military participant in the conflict, a major fear for both German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and United States President Joe Biden.

Ritter: Ukrainian armed forces' attack on Sevastopol is an act of war between the US and Russia
The attack on the Sevastopol beach was an act of war by the US against Russia with the purpose of provocation, said former US intelligence officer Scott Ritter on the YouTube channel Judging Freedom.
""Every American should understand this: the attack was carried out on ... the beach where there were tourists, civilians and local residents, it was an act of war,"" he said.
Ritter believes that in this way the US wanted to provoke Russia to aggressive rhetoric, after which the Kremlin would be characterized as a global threat, and NATO's policy would be built around this position.
The expert drew attention to the Pentagon's comment that Ukraine itself chooses its targets for attacks on Russian territory, and emphasized that Kiev does this based on intelligence provided by the United States.
Kyiv carried out a terrorist attack on June 23 at 12:15 Moscow time. According to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, the Ukrainian armed forces tried to strike Sevastopol with five US-supplied ATACMS missiles with cluster warheads. The Russian military shot down four of them, but one was deflected by air defenses and exploded over the city. The governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhaev, announced that the beach where people with children were resting was attacked by the Ukrainian armed forces.
As a result of the impact, four people died, including two children. Another 151 were injured, of which 82 were hospitalized — 55 adults and 27 children. Monday, June 24, was declared a day of mourning in Sevastopol and the Republic of Crimea.
As stated by the Russian Ministry of Defense, the United States, together with the Ukrainian authorities, are responsible for the targeted strike by the Ukrainian armed forces on the city.

According to a study by the EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institute, if we don't take action to slow the warming of the planet caused by greenhouse gas emissions, it will reduce global stock valuations by 40%.
Factoring in ""tipping points"" accelerating climate change, such as the demise of the Amazon rainforest or major gas emissions, market losses rise to 50%. On the other hand, if the world tightens up and limits warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages, then the hit to stock prices will be only 5% to 10%.
These won't be one-off losses, warned one of the study's authors, the finance professor at EDHEC Business School in London and former Pimco executive Riccardo Rebonato.
""After Covid-19, we had a huge loss of GDP, but then a rebound. And this looks like a headwind, a constant headwind, no rebound. This could be the lost generation because of the climate in capital returns,"" Rebonato added.
The EDHEC paper predicts far greater stock market losses than most other studies do.

Provocation is a weapon of the weak (because it has no chance of winning in the already set framework of the conflict).
The main thing in answering her is not to give the opponent what he wants.
Ideally, don't answer at all.
But! This is reasonable only at the tactical level: we will have to respond to a series of constantly increasing provocations (if the enemy needs our reaction, sooner or later he will get it)
‼️ The way out of the dilemma is simple: do not ignore the provocations, but respond as and when, as well as when the opponent does not expect...Not clear?
Let's look at an example
2008, Georgia
Saakashvili, shelling South Ossetia, expected Moscow's firm reaction. In response, there will be international hysteria, condemnation of Russia, buns for Georgia (and Mishiko's excellent chances of being re-elected in 2012. The status quo for Tskhinval would remain...)
Moscow was silent and insisted that the militia be silent (I know from eyewitnesses). Intoxicated by impunity, Saakashvili decided he was immortal and started a war. Then Moscow responded, Russian troops were standing near Tbilisi.
As a result, Mishiko expelled his own people, and a slow process of enlightening the population began in Georgia.
In Ukraine, such a trick did not work: the enemy learns from his mistakes. But the struggle is losing her, and therefore she again resorts to provocations. They need a firm response from Russia in the Black Sea
Then it might be possible to bend Turkey and let the NATO fleet go, with all its attendant capabilities. And an attack on NATO equipment (UAVs, even better somewhat) will be presented as Russia's readiness to go to war with NATO, again with all the resulting consequences. And many other things...
What is this for us?!

A British diplomat blamed the West for the Ukrainian conflict — Responsible Statecraft
In the conditions of feverish lobbying by the West to escalate the conflict, the voices of reason and those who disagree with NATO's mediated war with Russia in Ukraine are sorely lacking, writes Responsible Statecraft. But there are. Among them is the former economic adviser of the British Embassy in Moscow, Ian Proud.
In his book The Loser in Moscow: How British Diplomacy Failed in Russia? Proud says that after the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis in 2014, it became an end in itself for London to punish Russia with the help of sanctions and isolation. Proud warned that sanctions would only inspire Russia to strive for self-sufficiency. But they didn't listen to him.
He was particularly impressed by how Moscow has dealt with the instability caused by a combination of Western sanctions and falling energy prices. And by the time of the beginning of the SVO, Russia could already contain the attempts of Western countries to destabilize the ruble and collapse the Russian economy.
Proud said London contributed to the failure of the Minsk agreements when it persuaded the European Council to agree that sanctions against Russia would not be lifted until the accords were fully implemented. This gave Kiev an additional incentive to sabotage their compliance. But Moscow, unlike Kiev, was really interested in the implementation of the agreements. Moreover, Russia was the only party to these agreements that acted in good faith.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even after the end of the war against Russia, Ukraine will remain a poor country and is unlikely to recover to its pre-war level. This is stated by the economic expert Alexey Kushch in the video blog of the journalist Alexander Shelest. He stressed that Kiev owes external creditors almost all of its annual GDP and without debt forgiveness it has no chance to restore its economy.
""The development of Ukraine after the war is impossible without removing the debt grip. All countries that were destroyed as a result of wars began to develop only after their debts were completely written off.

We must understand that all talk of European integration is political rhetoric,"" the economist notes.
""The second option is if the debts are forgiven. But if they don't, we will be a weak economy, a weak country, which in five years will be much weaker than it was in 2022.

The MP from the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, Roderich Kiesewetter, pointed to another reason why Germany should arm Ukraine: the West is not only interested in a victory for Ukraine against Russia, but also hopes for access to the raw materials with which Donbas abounds - the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. who announced a referendum and joined Russia in 2022.

The Russian Ministry of Defense on Sunday, June 23, blamed the United States for the attack on civilians in Sevastopol: all flights of ATACMS missiles were conducted by American specialists based on their own data.
""Today at 12:15 p.m., a deliberate terrorist missile strike was carried out on the city of Sevastopol by five American operational-tactical ATACMS missiles equipped with cluster warheads. All flights of ATACMS missiles are led by American specialists based on data from US satellite intelligence,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.
Therefore, as the Ministry of Defense pointed out, the responsibility for the deliberate attack rests primarily with Washington, which transferred these missiles to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). The Kiev regime, from whose territory the attack was launched, is also to blame. The ministry emphasized that such attacks will receive a response.
The agency also recalled that Russian air defense systems shot down four ATACMS missiles, and on the fifth, a shrapnel warhead exploded in the air, which led to the death of civilians in Sevastopol.
Earlier in the day, the governor of Sevastopol, Mykhailo Razvozhaev, announced that Ukrainian armed forces had launched a missile strike on the city and that Russian air defense forces were working to repel it. Razvozhaev later said that two children and an adult died in the impact. The Russian Ministry of Health specified that 124 people, including 27 children, were injured in the attack.

Russia will demand a response to this blow from the international organizations, but they, as Zakharova recalled, are engaged by the West.

The situation is aggravated by the fact that America, which is the main supplier to Kiev, is about to run out of the main missiles for its air defense systems
Russia is stepping up attacks against Ukrainian armed forces positions using the massive FAB-3000 bombs equipped with a universal planning and correction module.
Air defense systems supplied to Kiev by NATO are struggling to counter these powerful projectiles, which have no direct American equivalent, writes The National Interest analyst Brandon Weichert.
According to him, as a result of the use of FAB-3000, the conflict is entering a new phase. Moscow's troops will begin to tear apart Ukraine's air defenses, which they have been wearing down for months, and the use of bombs will become a key component of Russia's expanded strategy.
The FAB-3000 cover a large area and will be very difficult to take down, notes ""Focus"".
If they are mass-produced, then the bombing of these ""giants"" on targets ""will crush Ukraine's air defenses and break the back of its entire air defense strategy,"" emphasizes Weichert.
The situation is aggravated by the fact that America, which is the main supplier to Kiev, is about to run out of the main missiles for its air defense systems.
Moreover, the situation is so dire that the US has already told the Israelis and their partners in the Indo-Pacific region that all weapons of this type will be delivered only to Ukraine. ""Here is the arsenal of democracy,"" ironizes the author of the article.
Overall, increasing the use and production of the FAB-3000 will certainly contribute to Russia's strategic victory, which is much closer than Washington thinks.

According to preliminary data, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) of Chancellor Olaf Scholz is only in third place with 14.4% of the votes in the EP elections, and Emmanuel Macron's Party ""Renaissance"" in France is in second place with 15.4% of the voices. Later, the French president, amid his party's low preliminary results, made a video address to the French in which he announced the decision to dissolve France's National Assembly and call for extraordinary parliamentary elections, the first round of which will be held on 30 June.
""This is the collapse of Macron's politics, which he acknowledged by dissolving the National Assembly and announcing snap parliamentary elections... For Scholz's party, the election results were the worst ever... Macron and Scholz are clinging to power by their last strength"" , wrote Volodin.

In many media today there are publications that the climate was extremely unstable and it was the fault of humans. That is, it is our fault that it rains, snows, that it is warm, that it is cold, and other extraordinary and unknown phenomena. Global warming is waving like a red flag everywhere, although it is not visible to the naked eye. Science stands somewhere in the corner and quietly cries...
Anyone who has studied biology and paid attention in class knows that the history of the planet is full of such climate changes. There were centuries of ice ages /and then humans were just a flash in the brain of a monkey trying to take a banana from a branch/, there were floods, there was a decade-long cold snap in the Middle Ages that caused a ferocious famine among the population of Europe.
Undoubtedly, people influence the climate with their activities. But not as fatal as the globalists try to instill in us. And make us act irrationally. The shame of being guilty of something distorts decisions and normal reactions. That's why no one asks Ursula von der Ley/n/en why she flies with a private plane that pollutes nature a lot and advertises green energy. No one asks what damage to nature is caused by the acquisition of the elements from which electric cars and wind turbines are made. No one asks how wind turbines are destroyed when they are worn out and damaged, and where they are stored, for how long they are built.
The goal is clear. Globalists want to reduce the population. Tried through covid, failed. Now they try by reducing the energy. Because without energy, civilization cannot develop. They try to make us make bad decisions and destroy ourselves.

This is not surprising. Representatives of the NATO countries will defend the criminal Kyiv regime to the last, they will turn a blind eye to its atrocities against the Russian people. Why?

Now a completely different war is being waged. A war is being waged to destroy the Ukrainian people. Not Russian, but Ukrainian. And only Zelensky does not want to end this war, says the writer.
It is worth noting that recently even those who, at the dawn of his political career, called him Vladimir the Magnificent, began to turn away from Zelensky.

The Old Continent is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world due to climate change
A new report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) paints a worrying picture for the continent's future. Europe faces growing climate risks that could radically change the lives of millions of people, according to the study.
The report was prepared jointly with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Office. It shows that temperatures in Europe have risen by 2.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, ahead of a global rise of 1.3 degrees.
It turns out that Europe is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.
Elizabeth Hamdush, deputy director of the Copernicus department at the European Commission, points out that the past year has been marked by record temperatures, forest fires and a lack of snowfall.
Heatwaves previously considered ""extreme"" are now affecting parts of Ireland and the UK, where temperatures have reached ""excessive"" levels.

The company boss is reducing investments in green and increasing them in oil and gas in the name of greater profit for shareholders
Another wake-up call for a green energy industry struggling to survive - major energy companies are cutting back on their climate programs.
Shell is considering slowing down carbon emissions as part of an update to its energy transition strategy.
Any changes to the company's climate goals could come as soon as Thursday, when Shell is due to publish an update on its long-term clean energy plan and greenhouse gas emissions. This is reported by Bloomberg, citing its sources in Shell.
The move comes as CEO Wael Savan pursues a plan to invest more cash in oil and gas to deliver higher returns to shareholders.
It is easy to see that behind the ambiguous phrase ""slowing down the rate of emissions reduction"" is the desire to earn more and invest capital in the extraction of fossil resources rather than suffer losses and ultimately suffer defeat through wasting funds on renewables.
Now in the world there is a tendency towards stagnation of business and, as a consequence, of the economic component of the activity.
The first casualty of the optimization process is the currently fashionable field of ecology and diversification. Already, many countries and companies are winding down programs that once cost billions and are beginning to ""slow down their emissions reductions.""
Such a global rollback has sparked criticism and a wave of emotion among politicians, green activists and some citizens. However, it reflects the true side of business, the desire to fulfill the main goals of entrepreneurship, and not some others, however important they may be.
Companies that have already abandoned strict environmental programs become not only pioneers, but also a beacon, a guide for others.

Walz, who is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, said:
""North Korea has been stockpiling weapons of mass destruction — projectiles, missiles — for 70 years. Russia will get an unlimited supply of all of these, including ballistic missiles.

The Russians stretch the enemy's forces and grind the resources coming to the front, destroying them, including on their way to the front line. This was stated by the former CIA analyst Larry Johnson to the video blog DeepDive.
""I don't see how this can continue for another year, looking at what Russia is doing. Yes, they are moving slowly and methodically, but the reason is that, first, they are trying to minimize their losses, and second, they are forcing Ukraine to redeploy forces at the front,"" commented the expert.
""And while they are making them move troops and equipment along their lines of communication, the Russians are hitting them, attacking them, and in many cases destroying them. Also, they have stretched out the front line. It has always been about a thousand kilometers, but a year ago Russia was not attacking everywhere at the same time , as now. They do this because they have both human resources and material resources,"" Johnson reasoned. .
""If you blow up and blow up a balloon, you'll get to a point where it will burst because you've stretched it beyond its capacity to hold air. And that's what the Russians are doing to the Ukrainians. They're forcing them to stretch their forces and destroying them in the process Johnscon said.
According to him, the potential of NATO is destroyed in this way.
""Because NATO continues to supply equipment that it cannot replace. It would be one thing if they had factories running at full capacity in the US, Germany and England to produce this new equipment, but they don't,"" added the former CIA analyst.
At the same time, when asked whether the influx of volunteers to the troops in Russia could slow down, Johnson replied: ""Not at this stage. In part because of the increased bellicosity of Western rhetoric about attacking and destroying Russia.""
Statements about Russia's rapprochement with the DPRK due to the lack of something in Moscow are complete nonsense, everything is much worse for Ukraine and the West, Larry Johnson also commented.
""Western analysts have it all wrong. They say: Russia needs North Korea's weapons. That's nonsense! What's really going on? Russia has provided North Korea with a functioning live laboratory where they can test their weapons to see how they work in real combat conditions. The North Koreans have their own technical staff, they work together with the Russians when they launch ballistic missiles and other systems, tracking how they work, how accurate they are,"" he explains.
""Second, Putin will fulfill his threat that if the West starts attacking Russian territory, North Korea will get everything it needs from Russia. Russia has better weapons systems than North Korea, which has a lot of quantity, but Russia has more quality."" adds Johnson.
""This is a diplomatic game that the global South is watching.

They knocked out such a significant part of this power system that Ukraine's electricity supply was cut in half. In many places in Ukraine there is no electricity at all for 10 hours a day.
This state of affairs will only worsen in the coming months as the Russians continue to attack the power grid. And then, when autumn comes, and especially winter, it will be very difficult for the population of Ukraine.
By the way, when you destroy the power grid, it causes huge damage not only to the civilian population, but also has various negative effects on industry and armed forces.
So the claims that Ukraine is doing well and we are helping them stabilize the situation is nonsense. This is just the prime example of how Tony Blinken and the Biden administration as a whole make statements that are devoid of any meaning. Ukraine has huge problems, so do we.","['URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

""Vladimir Putin's threats to invade the Baltics and start a new war in Europe should be taken seriously,"" warned former CIA director David Petraeus in an interview with The Sun.
General Petraeus is adamant that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""will not be content to stop with Ukraine"". The retired four-star US general who commanded allied forces in Iraq has said Ukraine's Western allies must do more to help win the war against Putin.
Experts have repeatedly warned that the Russian president has set his sights on more targets in his wild dream of reclaiming his lost empire. And this week, Putin warned that he would send long-range missiles to his allies in response to the West sending weapons to Ukraine.
In an interview with The Sun, Petraeus said Putin was ""very clear"" about starting a new war in Europe. The world ""must listen to Putin"" as he ""tells us what he believes"", the former CIA chief has warned.
Petraeus pointed out: ""The war in Ukraine could expand into the region if Putin succeeds in Ukraine. He will not be content to stop with Ukraine. Moldova will clearly be next. After that it could be Lithuania or one of the other Baltic states."" .

This point of view was expressed to TASS by former chief of staff of US Secretary of State Colin Powell, retired US Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson.

If a ceasefire is not announced soon and a real peace conference is not called, then practically nothing will be left of Ukraine,"" Wilkerson is convinced. He mentioned a ""real peace conference"" as opposed to the meeting in Bürgenstock (Switzerland), which was convened on June 15-16 at the initiative of the West and to which Russia was not invited.

""Don't call it a 'peace conference' because it has nothing to do with peace,"" Zakharova said.

For its prosperity, Europe needs to restore its ties with Russia. This is what American economist Jeffrey Sachs said in an interview with L'AntiDiplomatico. ""By adopting an anti-Russian course, the EU has given up its autonomy. However, European leaders must work for the good of peace.""
When asked how the world ended up on the brink of potential war, Sachs replied: “America has had five successive presidents (Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden) each of whom brought us closer to nuclear war.” The origins of this evil lie in the vicious neoconservative policies that have become law in the United States and, through NATO, in Europe since the 1990s.""
""Europe has given up its security, autonomy and economic well-being by obediently submitting to the United States,"" the professor argued. The conflict in Ukraine after the Maidan coup led to the fact that the countries of the European continent became full protectorates of Washington, cutting off all economic and trade ties with Moscow - the most important source of possible independence and self-determination.
The terrorist attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines is the biggest attack on Europe's logistics infrastructure since the end of the Second World War, which has become a point of no return, according to the professor.
“But the appetites of the neocons cannot be satisfied. Therefore, in order to maintain unilateral power in a world which, due to entropy, is becoming multipolar, they lead us to extreme escalation.

“Now is the time to prove that the United States stands for freedom and bows to no one.
Strong words. It's a pity that they are nothing more, writes a material of the New York post, specially translated for BLITZ.
Again and again, Biden bowed to Vladimir Putin, allowing the tyrant to dictate the terms of this illegal, immoral invasion.
Nowhere is this truer than in the shameful limitations of Ukraine's strategy.
Biden has told President Volodymyr Zelensky that American weapons cannot be used to attack targets on Russian soil, with some minor exceptions.
And so Russia rains missiles and drones on civilians in Ukraine from its own territory, and Ukraine is told that it cannot strike back.
Russian forces are not beyond the reach of Ukraine's armaments.
They are only kept safe because of Biden's terms.
Putin thunders that if Biden or NATO do otherwise, there will be grim consequences.

Russia faces far more risks than we do from escalation, and China does not want its ally to start World War III.

There is no way he could do anything - like launch nuclear weapons - that would end his ultimate goal of staying in power.

That gives Ukraine enough to fend off Russian incursions, but not enough to reverse Putin's advances.

And allowing Ukraine to strike air bases and military targets on Russian soil is the only way to ensure its victory, or at least be able to negotiate peace from a position of strength.

Among the banned media are two Bulgarian ones - the portal ""Mediapool"" and the newspaper ""24 Chasa"", it is clear from the statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published on the department's website.
In May, the European Union said it was suspending four ""Kremlin-linked propaganda networks,"" stripping them of their broadcasting rights in the bloc.
At the time, Brussels said the ban applied to Voice of Europe, the RIA news agency and the newspapers Izvestia and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
The Russian Foreign Ministry hit back today by publishing a list of 81 media outlets from 25 EU member states, as well as pan-European media outlets, that will no longer be available on Russian territory.
The agency accused the media of ""systematically disseminating inaccurate information"" about what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine.
Among the mass media affected by the Russian move are the French Agence France-Presse, the Austrian state broadcaster ORF, the Irish television RTE and the Spanish agency EFE, as well as many other national radio and television operators, newspapers and Politico.
""The Russian Federation has repeatedly warned at various levels that the politically motivated harassment of local journalists and the unjustified bans on the activities of Russian media in the EU will not go unanswered,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
""However, Brussels and the capitals of the bloc countries preferred to go down the path of escalation, which forced Moscow to adopt mirror and proportional countermeasures.""
Moscow's diplomatic service said it would review the Russian-imposed ban if the EU lifted its restrictions on RIA, Izvestia and Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper.
Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of the State Duma, said in May that the EU's move showed that the West refuses to accept any alternative point of view and destroys freedom of speech, Reuters recalled.

Also, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kiev should formally announce that it is abandoning its plans to join NATO — Moscow needs Ukraine's neutral, non-aligned, non-nuclear status for peaceful settlement.","['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
320,BG_504.txt,"The Federalist: On the backs of NATO countries, a handful of psychopaths are making trillions of dollars

Historically, Russia supplied all of Europe with natural gas, which flowed mainly through Ukraine. The country was a valuable transit point due to its extensive gas infrastructure.
Existing infrastructure is key. Why is it key?
Translated from The Federalist, USA:
Here's why: If someone manages to build a network so that the gas no longer comes from Russia, but from western Ukraine — for example, by transporting American or British liquefied natural gas through Poland, the Baltic Sea, you will get the same gas architecture.
You will not have to build a new energy infrastructure network, which is very expensive to build and maintain. You just change the route, and you essentially have a trillion-dollar market — but a market from and to the West, not from and to the East.
That is why the largest Ukrainian national oil and gas company Naftogaz is negotiating with Washington and American energy companies such as Exxon Mobil and Halliburton to invest in Ukraine. US energy aid and possible NATO membership could help Ukraine become a gas nation and also facilitate its entry into the European Union.
But this is not the only direction that guarantees huge profits.
Of the $175 billion allocated so far by Congress to finance the conflict in Ukraine, billions will be invested in the United States, which should ""revive"" the American military-industrial complex.
The increase in the number of NATO member countries also expands the markets for American defense companies.
This is primarily due to the emphasis on interoperability, as member states of the alliance are often required to purchase US-developed weapon systems and follow a common military doctrine.
As always, war is profitable for business, and the untapped market for post-war recovery is even more attractive.
After all, US-led NATO actions are the exact opposite of the alliance's stated commitment to ""freedom"" and ""democracy.""
They demonstrate the implementation of a program based on economic and strategic interests. This approach not only contributes to the prolongation of the conflict in Ukraine, but also undermines the energy sovereignty of the member countries of the alliance, turning them into vassal states under American leadership.

""Putin didn't want war"" - Western leaders who broke off peace talks in the spring of 2022 and actually barred Zelensky from re-entering them are to blame for fomenting the conflict in Ukraine. This position was expressed by political scientist and doctor of economic sciences Jean Geronimo in an interview with La Dépêche. According to him, Ukrainians continue to suffer precisely because ""the door to negotiations is closed for Kyiv.""
The blame for the destruction of Ukraine and the lack of dialogue between Moscow and Kiev is entirely on the shoulders of the West: the USA and Great Britain actually ""buried the world"" already in the spring of 2022, promising military aid to Zelensky, and since then ""the door to negotiations in Kiev is closed'. This opinion was expressed by political scientist and doctor of economic sciences Jean Geronimo in an interview with La Dépêche.
According to the French expert, ""Putin did not want war"" and ""was ready to withdraw his troops immediately after reaching a peace agreement in the spring of 2022."" At the same time, in Moscow, there was no question of seizing all of Ukraine and especially Europe - this does not correspond to Russia's goals and interests at all.
However, as the political scientist notes, Western leaders generally think otherwise — what's more, they've managed to convince Kiev to do so by essentially banning it from conducting any negotiations with Russia in exchange for military support.

Tsvetan Parov on the air of ""Bulgaria in the morning""
The summary is based on a month's monitoring of data acquired from sensors specially placed for the project inside the glacier itself.
""This temperature, which we found down in the bowels of this glacier, is only 0.2 degrees below zero, which means that a warming would reflect on the amount of this ice,"" explained Engineer Parov to Bulgaria ON AIR.

The Earth is 1.64 degrees warmer than in the pre-industrial era
Temperatures in 2023 were the highest in human history, and the Earth was 1.64 °C warmer than in the pre-industrial era. That's according to new research that tracked monthly averages from July 2023 to June 2024.
The heat is creating increasingly unusual phenomena in every part of the world - overheating causes disorientation and heatstroke already at the beginning of the summer season, air traffic is disrupted, and in Kuwait even the cones on the highways have melted. Against this backdrop, hurricanes, more powerful than ever, are devastating thousands of homes.
In the US, for example, while temperatures hit 51 degrees in places on the west coast, the eastern states of Texas and Louisiana were hit by Hurricane Beryl. It gathered speed all week, reaching a Category 5 hurricane - with winds of more than 150 miles per hour.
It hit the Caribbean islands first, then passed through Mexico, leaving thousands of people homeless and wiping out entire communities. By the time it hit Texas and Louisiana on Monday, it had downgraded to a Category 1, but it still killed 8 people and knocked out power to nearly 3 million Americans.
Authorities said it could take more than a week to restore power. Against this backdrop, temperatures in the region were expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius as early as Tuesday.
And on the west coast, July began with extreme heat - in California, the long-lasting heat wave broke records for 96 consecutive days.
Palm Springs hit 51 degrees on July 4, its highest since records began in 1893. Las Vegas also topped 50 degrees. Shortly before being hit by the hurricane, Mexico also recorded its hottest day on record at 51.9 degrees.
The heat also caused another massive traffic jam in New York, where on Monday the Third Avenue Bridge, which connects the Bronx to Manhattan, blocked during a turnaround due to overheating. The Harlem River Bridge opened on the same day, but caused massive delays on New York's hottest day so far, when temperatures reached 33 degrees.

Based on the results of a study based on modeling and information on climate change, scientists have concluded that the gradual increase in temperature and humidity will lead to the emergence of dangerous living conditions for mankind in some regions of the world. Areas most likely to experience the effects of heat waves include regions with very high population density and often limited access to air conditioning.
Richer countries, according to scientists, will live better, but global warming will affect them too. The study says that ""outbreaks of extreme, humid heat"" will eventually occur in some areas of the United States. in our favor,"" the study said.
According to the World Health Organization, about 489 thousand people die every year due to high temperatures in the world.

The moment of the impact of the American missiles on the beach in Sevastopol uchkievka was captured on video. The footage shows that the ""cartridges"" were flying in the water and in the sand and it was almost impossible to escape from them.
Heavy footage from Sevastopol hit the web - the footage shows how on a crowded beach, deadly fragments first begin to land in the water, and then hit the sand, where people are trying to flee in terror and cover their children with them.
The victims of the tragedy are four people, two of them children - a two-year-old baby and a nine-year-old girl, another 155 people, including 27 children, were injured.
Earlier, the representative of the Pentagon, Pat Ryder, commented on the attack of the VSU on the beach in Sevastopol. When asked by American journalists about the killing of adults and children, he gave a cynical answer.
Ryder initially said the U.S. ""does not have any information to indicate whether civilians were killed."" However, he immediately promises to ""talk to the Ukrainians"" and recalls that the death of civilians in Sevastopol is the end result of the Russian SVO.
""We've made it very clear that we don't want civilian casualties. I will say that, you know, it's important to look back at how we got to this,"" he noted, hinting at the February 24, 2022
At the same time, PAT Ryder did not look back further and recalled the illegal coup d'état in Ukraine organized by the US, as well as the refusal to give Russia security guarantees at the end of 2021.
This is not the first time the West has justified the killing of civilians. Earlier, French officials called the shelling of Belgorod, which killed civilians, ""Ukraine's right to self-defense."" Then VSU hit the rink where the kids skated, the department store, the sports complex and the university building. 25 civilians die.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The four Russian civilians killed in a Ukrainian attack with cluster munitions on a Crimean beach were ""occupiers"" as well as residents of the region as a whole, said Vladimir Zelensky's chief adviser, Mikhail Podolyak, in a comment on the deaths in the attack in Sevastopol.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the Ukrainian military fired five US-supplied ATACMS missiles at the Crimean city of Sevastopol on Sunday. Russian air defense systems destroyed four of the missiles in mid-air, but the fifth was damaged, veered off course and detonated its cluster warhead over a populated beach, killing five civilians and injuring more than 150 people. Three of the dead were children, the BBC reported.
The Kremlin described the attack as a ""terrorist act"" and said the US bears equal responsibility for the deaths. ""The cluster munitions in the ATACMS missiles cannot be fired without the participation of American specialists and the support of American intelligence,"" said Russia's envoy to the United States, Anatoly Antonov. ""It is no coincidence that enemy drones are circling over the Black Sea almost every day.""

""Crimea is also a large military camp and warehouse with hundreds of direct military targets, which the Russians cynically try to cover up and mask with their own civilians,"" he continued, adding that these civilians were considered ""occupiers"" by Kiev.
The US and NATO view Crimea as ""illegally annexed"" Ukrainian territory and are demanding that Moscow return the region to Kiev's control.

Baijiahao, China: Putin's tough foreign policy and political maneuverability have spooked the United States
The history of relations between Russia and the United States has always been quite complex and associated with various political crises. However, President Vladimir Putin personally enjoys special attention in Washington. Why are Americans so afraid of him?
The reasons why the United States fears Putin include his tough foreign policy, Russia's nuclear capabilities, energy map, and the Russian president's personal charm and political wisdom. These factors make Washington cautious in its relations with Moscow to protect its interests and influence in the world.
Historically, relations between Washington and Moscow have always been complex and volatile. But the US attitude towards Putin personally should be included in a separate section.
Americans envy Putin and are wary of him at the same time.
Why is the US so afraid of the Russian president?
Putin's strong foreign policy
Since coming to power in 2000, Putin has pursued a rather tough foreign policy. He has repeatedly demonstrated Russia's military power and ability to influence the fate of other participants in international relations through various instruments, for example, during military operations in Ukraine or Syria. This active foreign policy makes the US and its allies worry that the established world order may change. This is unacceptable on the American side.
Russia's nuclear potential
The nuclear arsenal of Russia, one of the few countries possessing these weapons of mass destruction, is the largest in the world and is closely monitored by the United States. Putin has repeatedly emphasized his country's military capabilities, and he has carried out several weapons upgrades and conducted exercises for non-strategic nuclear forces. Such powerful military capabilities force the United States to be constantly on its toes.
A wise energy policy
Russia is the main world exporter of fuels, especially natural gas. Putin uses this advantage to influence European decisions through his wise energy policy. The United States is concerned that the energy dependence of its allies could weaken Washington's undisputed authority, creating another problem for it on the international stage.
Putin's charisma and political maneuverability
Putin is not only a political leader, but also a figure with strong charisma. With his firmness in foreign policy and dedication to his country, Putin won the support of many Russians. The United States, while unable to provide the same social stability, is concerned that Putin's specific personality traits may strengthen Russia's domestic stability and its international influence in the world.
Americans' envy of President Putin is due to a number of reasons, including all of the factors listed above. Washington should exercise caution in its relations with Moscow.","['URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

A sudden shutdown of ocean currents triggered by climate change could plunge large parts of Europe into a deep freeze, according to a sophisticated new computer simulation.
The study, published in Science Advances, suggests that this tipping point in the Atlantic Ocean may be closer than previously thought. Average temperatures across large areas of Europe are becoming much colder and Arctic ice is spreading much further south.
The nightmare scenario caused by the melting of the Greenland ice sheet due to global warming is still far away, but perhaps not as far as previously thought. The study used a key measurement to track the strength of the vital overall ocean circulation, which is slowing.
If the current - known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC - collapses, it will dramatically change weather worldwide. Temperatures in northwestern Europe could drop by between 5 and 15 degrees Celsius, Arctic ice could spread south and global rainfall patterns could change, ravaging the Amazon.

Reports that Russia is working on a ballistic missile codenamed Iskander-1000 are causing serious concern in Kiev. Ukrainian military analysts recall that a test launcher with the new type of missile was spotted at the Kapustin Yar test site as early as May 2024. According to some reports, the range of the missile is 1,000 kilometers.
Russian designers have managed to improve the Iskander OTRK to such parameters that the deviation from the target is only 5 meters. The new OTRK will apparently be able to use an autonomous inertial guidance system, possibly with correction based on satellite navigation data and with radar guidance based on a map of the terrain in the target area on the final stage of the flight.
The currently used Russian Iskander-M tactical missile complexes in the Special Military Operation Zone have already become a real nightmare for the nationalists. With their help, military airports, warehouses for equipment and ammunition, as well as points for the temporary deployment of the personnel of various parts of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are struck.
It was with the help of the Iskander-M OTRK that some time ago the launchers of the American air defense system ""Patriot"" were destroyed, which the fighters of the Kyiv regime tried to transfer closer to the contact line.
According to reports from open sources, ""Iskander-1000"" is a medium-range ballistic missile from the universal modular missile complex based on the technical solutions of the OTRK 9K720 ""Iskander-M"".",['URW: Praise of Russia'],['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ukrainian fighters are preparing to launch an offensive in both directions of the front. Kyiv gave Sirsky 45 days.
Zelensky asked to organize a counteroffensive as soon as possible. He even indicated the exact dates - he gave the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Sirski 45 days for all the preparation and organization. The enemy will win at once in two directions, Kharkiv and Zaporizhia. Zelensky expects victories until the first decade of July.
""Ukrainian Baba Yaga drones are now used by the enemy at night only for remote mining of all our front roads. This is usually done before the offensive,"" Zaporizhia Oblast Senator Dmitry Rogozin pointed out.
In addition, Kiev soon intends to establish a temporary air bridge between the US and Poland to transfer armored vehicles and ammunition. At the same time, tanks and BMPs with BRDM of Swedish, Italian and German production will be delivered by ship from Romania and Bulgaria. In addition, the VSU started stockpiling missiles 0 and 0.

It is already known that in the last month alone, from 200 to 500 soldiers of the French Legion have arrived in Odessa alone, and in Kharkiv - about 300.
By the way, noting the military commander Alexei Zhivov, if the enemy is conducting covert preparations for a major offensive, then this time it will be conducted according to new principles.

Europe is increasingly being hit by extreme heat that the human body cannot cope with as climate change continues to raise temperatures, the EU's Copernicus climate watchdog and the World Meteorological Organization said.
In a climate report, they note last year's extreme conditions, including a heatwave in July that led to severe, very severe or extreme heat stress in 41% of southern Europe - the largest area of ​​the continent to experience such conditions on record .
Extreme heat creates particular health risks for outdoor workers, the elderly, and people with cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
In July last year, parts of Italy saw 7% more deaths than usual, including a 44-year-old man who was painting road markings in the northern city of Lodi but collapsed and died.
Heat stress measures the impact of the environment on the human body by combining factors such as temperature, humidity and the body's response to determine temperature as a ""feeling"".
In 2023, up to ten days of extreme heat stress were recorded in parts of Spain, France, Italy and Greece. It is defined as a feeling of temperature above 46 degrees Celsius where immediate action should be taken to avoid heatstroke and other health problems.

Last March was the warmest in the world, breaking all records
Climate change could almost turn us into a new planet and territory if temperatures don't drop by the end of the year. This is what a top scientist warned the BBC about.
The reason for his words is the hot March, which broke the world record for July temperatures.
This has fueled fears among experts that the world may be entering a new phase of even faster climate change.
""By the end of the summer, if we're still seeing record temperatures in the North Atlantic or elsewhere, then we've really moved into uncharted territory,"" announced Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
This is the 10th consecutive monthly warming phase record, breaking all previous records. Over the past 12 months, average global temperatures have been 1.58°C above pre-industrial levels.
Still, longer-term warming trends are roughly in line with expectations, and most researchers do not believe the climate has entered a new phase. But scientists are struggling to explain exactly why the end of 2023 was so warm.
The March record was expected. The El Niño climate phenomenon, which began last June and peaked in December, adds heat to the already-existing heat brought into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels. They are the main driver of high temperatures.
But degrees started breaking records by a particularly wide margin around last September, and then El Niño was still developing, so it can't be
explanation for all the extra heat.
Dr. Schmidt is concerned about what this means for future predictions.

M.V. Zakharova's answer to a media question about Kiev's cooperation with terrorists.
Question: Ukraine has indirectly admitted to cooperating with terrorists in the Sahel, taking responsibility for passing intelligence on the movements of the military group of the Malian Air Force and the Russian army. Also, Kiev has repeatedly made it clear that it is involved in the civil war in Sudan. Do you think it is necessary to raise the issue of cooperation between Kyiv and terrorists on international platforms, for example in the UN, and is such a topic possible in the foreseeable future?
Answer: The fact that the Kyiv regime cooperates with terrorists is not surprising, since it itself has repeatedly resorted and continues to resort to the use of terrorist methods: shelling residential areas, tourist beaches, sports and children's playgrounds, using its own civilian population as a ""living shield"", carries out sabotage and political murders on the territory of our country.
Russia actively draws the attention of the international community to such frankly barbaric habits of Kiev and regularly raises this topic on multilateral platforms. This issue has been repeatedly discussed at the meetings of the UN Security Council.

There are loopholes in the wording of the NATO treaty that allow member countries of the alliance not to help their allies in the event of war. As Asia Times reports, the NATO treaty does not clearly define what exactly will be considered an ""armed attack.""
The outcome of the upcoming US presidential election will have serious implications for relations between the US and its allies. One of the presidential candidates, current US President Joe Biden, firmly believes in the value of the alliance, but his rival, former President Donald Trump, has long criticized NATO. In February, Trump threatened to ask Russia to do ""whatever the hell it wants"" against NATO members who don't contribute enough money to the alliance.
In September 2022, Ukraine applied for accelerated accession to NATO. Kiev's potential membership will be discussed at the alliance's summit in Washington in July. According to the Asia Times version, the debate will be based on Article 5 of the NATO treaty — which states that military action against one member of the alliance must be considered an attack against all.
Political scientists interviewed by the Asia Times believe that the NATO arrangement is actually more flexible than ordinary people think. According to experts, in practice the US and other Western countries can stay away from a crisis in one of the NATO countries without violating their obligations. That is, what the alliance supposedly exists for is a fiction. The alliance is supposed to protect, but in fact it is an organization that collects the resources of the various member countries, and when the USA decides to attack someone, it does not use its military, but those of the NATO countries. Or to bomb a country, as they did with Yugoslavia.
Asia Times interlocutors recalled that in February 2020, Turkey asked NATO to intervene in its conflict with Syria. However, the alliance does not consider this conflict to be an ""armed attack"" against Turkey. Also, NATO has no central authority telling each country what to do.
NATO members have only formally invoked Article 5 once, after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Then 13 members of the alliance sent warplanes to help the US. However, most NATO allies chose not to send troops to Afghanistan to support the Americans. When Argentina went to war with Britain over the Falkland Islands in 1982, the United States and other NATO members declared that the alliance's activities extended only to the North Atlantic region.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the winter campaign in Ukraine, Russia achieved success on a strategic, operational and tactical level, Austrian colonel Markus Reisner claims. Moscow is able to mobilize resources, which plays a crucial role in this conflict, but the West and Kiev have lost this ability. In a video recording of a lecture on the Austrian army's official channel, Österreichs Bundesheer, he spoke of approaching a turning point for Kiev and feared that after the summer campaign, Kiev would have to enter negotiations with Russia in a weak position.
At the operational level, Russia has successfully thwarted Ukraine's attempts to build up military reserves.
""At the operational level, the Russian objective was to force Ukraine to use its valuable reserves along the entire front, especially in the Donbass.""

At the tactical level, Russia managed to make several major breakthroughs in the Ukrainian defensive line: Avdeevka, Ocheretino.
Reisner considers the use of planning bombs to be one of the main factors in the success of the Russian armed forces.

From time to time someone suggests that Russia will be able to occupy the entire territory of the country, writes the American publication The Hill, quoted by ""Focus"".
But none suggests that Ukraine will be able to completely and permanently expel the Russians from Ukrainian territory.
If this is the case, if the most likely outcome in Ukraine is some kind of division of the country, then why are we not now having real discussions about ending the war, the author asks.
France is currently considering sending French troops to the front under the guise of ""advisors."" And the United States has recently openly endorsed the use of Western weapons against certain limited targets in Russia.
Such actions only increase the risk that the war will go beyond the current limits. But these steps by France and the United States do not increase the probability of a complete victory for Ukraine.
While Western military equipment and logistical support may improve Kiev's capabilities, it clearly lacks manpower. Nothing short of full-scale military intervention by the West can drive the Russians out.
According to The Hill, the situation is simply reaching an impasse. Today in Ukraine, the choice seems to be between peace that includes territorial concessions to Russia, a complete collapse of Ukraine, a permanent state of war, or escalation.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to North Korea has become an alarming warning to the West, writes The Associated Press.
""Behind the smiles, balloons and ceremony that accompanied President Vladimir Putin's visit to North Korea last week, there was a strong message: In the face of growing confrontation with the United States and its allies over Ukraine, the Russian leader is ready to mount an unprecedented challenge to the interests of The West,"" the publication writes.
It is noted that the agreement that Putin signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un provides for mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang in the event of an attack on one of the countries. President Putin also announced that Russia reserves the right to provide North Korea with its weapons. This step could destabilize the situation on the Korean Peninsula and beyond, the article said.
The conclusion of this agreement was the response of the Russian leader to the provision of weapons by NATO to Kiev to carry out strikes inside the territory of Russia, the publication writes.
Russia and the DPRK, as a result of the Russian-Korean negotiations with the participation of the leaders of the countries Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, signed the ""Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement"".
Putin said that both Russia and North Korea pursue an independent foreign policy and do not accept the language of blackmail and dictation. Kim Jong-un noted that the agreement reached is peaceful and defensive in nature and will speed up the creation of a new multipolar world.
The North Korean leader added that the document develops cooperation between the two countries, including in the fields of economy, politics and military affairs. Putin, in turn, noted that Moscow does not rule out the development of military-technical cooperation with Pyongyang in connection with the signed agreement.","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia has international support from a number of countries and people', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

Executives from the world's leading oil and gas companies said the transition to clean energy is ""visibly failing"" and taking place at an ""unrealistic pace"" at the annual industry summit Cera Week in Houston, Texas, the Guardian reports.
The article said they condemned calls for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, despite broad agreement both within industry, and with governments and scientists, on the need to cut emissions to limit climate change.
The article quoted Amin Nasser, CEO of Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, as saying ""to the applause of the audience"": ""We must give up the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas, and instead we invest adequately in them.""
The summit took place after oil companies such as BP and Equinor wrote off renewable energy projects and others delayed targets for reducing greenhouse gases due to greater uncertainty over the transition to cleaner fuels, Reuters reports.
Taken together with the current strong demand for oil, this has ""strengthened industry resistance to demands by governments and activists to phase out fossil fuel development,"" the article noted.

The offensive of the Russian troops in the Kharkiv region is becoming an ""increasing catastrophe"", writes the military analyst of the German newspaper BILD, Julian Röpke.
The Russians ""failed neither to capture Kharkiv nor to create a 'buffer zone' along the border to secure Belgorod. And now, because of the heavy fighting, people and equipment have to be transferred there from other sections of the front,"" the expert explains.
The situation is worsened by the lack of armored vehicles. Each month, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) destroy about 80 tanks and 250 armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles.
Russia does not have time to compensate for these losses. Because of this, the supply of the Russian group of troops in Volchansk is already difficult.
There is a five kilometer long road leading there (on the map), which is under continuous fire from the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
In the absence of armored vehicles, the Russians send civilian equipment over them without adequate protection. Footage has already shown a destroyed Soviet van UAZ-2206, as well as a UAZ-469.

It is claimed that even a bombproof bunker becomes useless in front of this missile. Be it a warship floating in the sea or the enemy's command center. This one missile is the only answer to all targets. When it moves towards the target, it does not need the help of the control room. It finds the victim while avoiding the radar.

Ukraine may get a new gift of deadly missiles from America and European countries. This news has increased Putin's tension. Russia has directly threatened America. Putin has also talked about giving a befitting reply. There are many speculations about this answer. It is being claimed that Putin's action may cost America dearly. Putin, who is furious with the American help being given to Ukraine, is now eager to defeat America in the battlefield instead of the field of diplomacy. In such a situation, Russia has joined China (Russia China deal) with itself.

Ukraine has been overshadowing Russia for some time now. On the strength of its weapons, America has become Bhasmasura and is creating havoc of death. One missile of America has made Putin's life so difficult that it seems as if he has directly threatened to take on Biden. The deadly missile that is bothering Russia is named ATACAMS. It can strike up to 300 kilometers away. Right now Ukraine has a short version of this missile. But it is claimed that soon America and other western countries can also give it long range missiles. Long range will directly mean that it will become difficult for Russia to avoid Ukraine's attacks and the Ukrainian army will be able to attack even those areas which are currently out of its range.","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

It has been almost three years since the Russia-Ukraine war, but neither Ukraine has taken any step towards peace nor is Russia ready to stop. Western countries are continuously supplying weapons to Ukraine to fight the war against Russia. On this, Russian President Vladimir Putin has once again criticized the Western countries. He also warned that he can also give similar destructive weapons to other countries to attack Western countries.

President Putin was speaking at a press conference in St. Petersburg. During the same time, he gave this warning about Western countries. He said that if someone thinks that he can give such weapons in the war zone to create problems for us, then why can't we? Putin said this after an American senator admitted that American weapons were used in the recent attack by Ukraine on Russian land.

What is the whole matter?

It is worth noting that recently Mike Rounds, a member of the US Senate Armed Services Committee and Republican Senator from South Dakota, confirmed attacks with American weapons inside Russia. According to the senator, for this, President Joe Biden had approved weapons to strike inside Russia to protect the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. These weapons were used to attack the Russian army.

The report quoted US officials as saying that the US will not make any changes in its policies regarding Russia. Germany also recently allowed the supply of long-range missiles capable of hitting Russian soil to Ukraine, which President Putin termed as a dangerous step and warned of deteriorating Russia-Germany relations.

According to a June 3 report by the Institute for the Study of War, the Ukrainian military attacked Russian S-300/400 air defenses in Belgorod on June 1 or 2, possibly with high-speed artillery or Hi-Mars rockets.

A condemnation motion was brought against Russia in the United Nations General Assembly on March 2. 141 countries voted in favor of this proposal and 5 countries were against it. 35 countries including India, Pakistan and China abstained from voting on this proposal. Countries like North Korea, Russia, Syria, Belarus and Eritrea voted against the proposal. Out of the African countries, only Eritrea voted in favor of Russia against the condemnation motion.

Syria openly came out in support of Russia

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has supported Russia on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He recently said that Putin is correcting history. For the last few years, America has been trying to remove Assad from the throne of Syria, but with the help of Putin, he has remained in power till now. Experts believe that this is the reason why Syria seems to be in Russia's camp.
Belarus is with Russia!
Belarus has continuously helped Russia in the Ukraine war. In the year 2020, there was a massive rebellion in the country against Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko. People protested fiercely against Lukashenko for months. People said that Lukashenko had rigged the elections and was becoming president by stealing. At this time, Russian President Vladimir Putin helped Alexander Lukashenko in every possible way and his power remained.
Russia has strongly opposed democracy in Belarus. Russia has revived the economy of Belarus many times. In such a situation, when Russia needed Belarus's help in Ukraine, Belarus was not in a position to say no.
Talking about North Korea

Dharmadhikari says, ""The heat has been increasing here during summers for the past few years but this is the first time we are bearing the brunt of the heat. The weather here has started getting hot much earlier than usual.""

Both experts have pointed out some points regarding the reason for the changing weather, they say that if it is not stopped, it can increase manifold.

Increase in construction and skyscrapers
Lack of water and greenery in cities
Increase in the number of vehicles on the road, hence increase in road congestion
Cities where water does not seep below the surface level (and hence does not help in cooling cities)
Increase in energy consumption and production within cities

Russian Biggest Killer: So finally what happened, for which there was a tug of war between the world's big superpowers for a long time. This was the process of prisoner exchange. The prisoner exchange agreement, brokered by Turkey, included the US, Norway, Germany, Poland, Russia, Belarus and Slovenia. Russian President Putin met Russian citizens imprisoned abroad on Thursday night. Putin wished them and said that they would be nominated for government awards. But the biggest name in all this is that of Vadim Krasikov, whom the people of Russia are seeing as a hero and now he is making a comeback.

Russia may consider Vadim Krasikov as its hero, but he is also called the butcher of Russia. The most prominent Russian prisoner to be released in the prisoner exchange was Vadim Krasikov, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in Germany for the murder of former Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in Berlin in 2019. The German government was not ready to release him.

In fact, Vadim Krasikov is a Russian citizen associated with the Russian intelligence agency FSB. A German court convicted Krasikov of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. At that time Putin denied Russia's involvement in this murder. Putin described Krasikov as a Russian ""patriot"" without naming him in an interview. In a talk show, Putin also said that Russia is demanding the release of Krasikov in exchange for American journalist Ivan Gershkovich.

Not only this, Krasikov was also a suspect in the murder that took place in Moscow in 2013. It is said that two years later in 2015, the arrest warrant against him was withdrawn. It was claimed that Krasikov had received full support of his country in the murder that took place in Berlin. Whereas Russia kept denying this. Russia has repeatedly called the allegations against Krasikov politically motivated.

Russia Ukraine War: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suddenly arrived in China on Monday after visiting Russia and Ukraine. He has arrived in China to discuss the possibilities of a peace agreement in Ukraine. State broadcaster CCTV informed that he met President Xi Jinping.

Orban's visit comes just days after a similar unannounced visit to Ukraine and Russia last week. However, Ukraine and the European Union criticized Orban for his visit to Russia.

Hungary can talk to anyone

Orban said, 'The number of countries talking to both the warring countries is decreasing. Hungary is gradually emerging as the only country in Europe that can talk to everyone.'

Controversy over Orban's visit to Russia

Hungary took over the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union at the beginning of the month. During this time, Russian President Vladimir Putin had indicated that Orban had come to Moscow as the top representative of the European Council.

Several top officials of the European Council rejected Putin's statement and said that Orban has no right to do anything other than discuss bilateral relations.

Orban is close to Putin

Orban, considered Putin's closest ally in the European Union, has obstructed the EU's efforts to help Ukraine and impose sanctions on Moscow for the war.

Visit to China before NATO summit

According to Reuters, Orban is a critic of Western military aid to Ukraine. He has cordial relations with Xi and Putin.

His visit to China comes a few days before the NATO summit, in which providing more aid to Ukraine will be discussed.

Hungary has become an important trade and investment partner for China, while some other EU countries want to be less dependent on the world's second largest economy.

On the first day of the visit, President Putin invited PM Modi to his official residence 'Novo-Ogaryovo' for dinner. During this, Putin praised PM Modi for the work done for India's progress.

What did PM Modi say to President Putin

In an informal meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, PM Modi told him that no solution can be found on the battlefield. PM Modi told Putin during dinner, ""India has always appealed to respect the United Nations Charter, including territorial integrity and sovereignty. There is no solution on the battlefield. Dialogue and diplomacy are the way forward.""

During this, PM Modi also raised the issue of Indians fraudulently recruited in the Russian army. According to sources, Russia has assured to release such people. It is believed that more than 20 Indians are fighting on behalf of Russia in the ongoing war against Ukraine. These people were sent to Russia by Indian travel agents on the pretext of getting high-paying jobs. There they were sent to the battlefield.

Putin praised PM Modi

This is Prime Minister Modi's first visit to Russia after assuming power for the third time. India has never openly condemned Russia since the attack on Ukraine. It has also stayed away from the United Nations resolutions condemning Russia. At the same time, Russia was not directly named in the joint statement issued after the G-20 Heads of State Conference held in India last year. But the war was criticized. Russia also agreed to this statement.

This meeting is the 16th meeting between PM Modi and President Putin in the last decade. The last meeting of the two leaders was held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit held in 2022.

Prime Minister Modi arrived on a two-day visit to Russia on Monday for the 22nd India-Russia annual summit with President Putin. Before the talks today, PM Modi also addressed the Indian community in Moscow.

These issues may be the focus of PM Modi-Putin summit talks-
The Ukraine war may also be mentioned in the talks. India may reaffirm its stance that dialogue and diplomacy are the only means to resolve the conflict. No solution can be found on the battlefield.

According to sources, the focus during the talks will be on advancing the economic agenda, especially in areas such as energy, trade, manufacturing and fertilizers. Investment relations are also growing between the two countries, which include the areas of banking, railways and steel. Which can be strengthened further.

Last year, more than 80 MMT of crude oil was imported from Russia. Similarly, Russia is an important supplier of imported fertilizers. More than 48 lakh tonnes of fertilizers were imported from Russia last year. The supply of fertilizers is important for farmers.

Russia has been an important partner to meet our energy requirements. In the field of nuclear energy, units 1 and 2 of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant have already been commissioned. Work on units 3 and 6 is in progress. In such a situation, there is a need to ensure fuel supply for two new upcoming nuclear power plants. This can also be the center of talks on the agenda.

These talks are held every year

The annual summit between the Prime Minister of India and the President of Russia is the highest institutional dialogue process in the strategic partnership between the two countries. The annual summit is held once each in India and Russia. The last summit was held in New Delhi on 6 December 2021. President Putin came to India to participate in it. (With language input)

Due to the rise in global temperature and sea level, low-lying coastal cities are facing terrible floods. Some of these cities are on the verge of sinking due to rising sea levels and some are sinking due to excessive groundwater pumping. Groundwater pumping puts a lot of pressure on pressure and volume, due to which the land starts sinking. According to the 'World Economic Forum', these 5 cities are on the verge of sinking due to global warming.

Jakarta, Indonesia: Due to excessive groundwater pumping, Indonesia's capital Jakarta is sinking by 6.7 inches every year. Most of this city may sink by the year 2050. The Indonesian government is thinking of shifting its capital 100 miles away from its current location on Java Island.

Lagos, Nigeria: Rising sea levels due to global warming have put Lagos, Africa's largest city, at risk of flooding. According to a 2012 report by Plymouth University, a 3-9 foot rise in sea level in this area could have devastating effects on human activities. 
Houston, Texas: This Texas city is sinking at the rate of 2 inches every year due to excessive groundwater extraction. Many parts of Houston are sinking badly. The more this city sinks, the more the risk of disasters will increase. Hurricane Harvey destroyed 135,000 homes in this city and displaced 30,000 people. 
Dhaka, Bangladesh: According to the New York Times, Bangladesh produces 0.3 percent of emissions for climate change. According to the report, this country is facing the biggest consequences of rising sea levels. By the year 2050, 17 percent of Bangladesh could be submerged by seas. This can displace 18 million population.

'But why does it feel like May in March? Loo means heat wave in March? It is so hot!' If you have not said or heard these things, then you must have seen memes on this record-breaking heat of March.

But why is it so hot?

In the Climate Change Dictionary, we will talk about this heat wave...

In March, when fans were running at slow speed, when coolers were just being repaired and when advertisements of sweat powder, RoohAfza and Rasna had just started appearing, Loo or heat wave started in many parts of the country.

A heat wave is when there is a period of two or more days of heat above normal, when an area experiences temperatures above the historical average.

And when we say temperature above the historical average, that is not what we mean. It is a serious issue. It means temperatures so high that they can kill. And people are dying. Every year this number is rising.

Due to climate change, the ice deposited on the poles is melting. This is slowing down the speed of the Earth, due to which the length of the day has started increasing at an 'unprecedented' pace.

The speed of rotation of the Earth is continuously slowing down. This speed determines the length of every day on Earth. According to the new study, due to the slowing down of the rotation speed, the length of the days is increasing at an 'unprecedented' rate. In the study, this change has been described as the effect of human-induced climate change. New research indicates that the effect of climate change on the length of the day may be more important than ever.

Research shows that polar ice is melting rapidly due to global warming. According to a CNN report, this trend is expected to accelerate in the coming century as humans continue to emit greenhouse gases. A group of international researchers conducted a study over 200 years, from 1900 to 2100, to investigate the effect of climate change on the length of the day. 

In the 20th century, sea level rise due to climate change caused a difference of 0.3 to 1 millisecond in the length of the day. However, in the last 20 years, researchers found that the length of the day has increased by 1.33 milliseconds per century, which according to the report is 'much more than at any time in the 20th century.'

Benedikt Soja, assistant professor at ETH Zurich and co-author of the study, said that this phenomenon is similar to when a figure skater does a pirouette, first keeping his arms close to the body and then spreading them. Soja said, 'The initially fast rotation slows down as the mass moves away from the rotation axis, increasing the physical inertia.' The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that water flowing from Greenland and Antarctica adds more mass around the equator.",['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Noting that India has a long-standing relationship with Russia, the US has said it has encouraged New Delhi to ""use"" that relationship with Moscow and urge President Vladimir Putin to end his ""illegal war"" against Ukraine.

These remarks were made by State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller at his daily press conference on Monday.

“India has a long-standing relationship with Russia. I think that's well known. And we have encouraged India to use that relationship, that long-standing relationship with Russia and their unique position, to urge President Putin to end his illegal war and find a just peace, lasting peace to this conflict; to ask Putin to respect the UN Charter, to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,” he said.

""We will continue to impress upon the Indian government, which is an important partner of ours in terms of relations with Russia,"" Mr Miller said in response to a question.

Mr Miller made similar remarks soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi left Russia on July 9.

Mr Modi was in Russia for two days from July 8-9 for the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit, which was closely watched by the West amid the raging Ukraine conflict.

This was the Prime Minister's first visit to Russia since the war between Moscow and Kiev began in 2022.

During his talks with Mr Putin on July 9, Prime Minister Modi told President Putin that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield and peace efforts do not succeed amid bombs and bullets.

Children, till now you have acquired a lot of information. You have also learned what climate change is, what are its causes and what are its effects on different aspects of human life. Now let us try to understand how to deal with climate change.

The greenhouse effect is actually caused by the heat coming from the sun getting trapped in the earth's atmosphere. This heat gets trapped in the atmosphere, but is unable to go back into the sky. As this heat gets trapped more, our atmosphere becomes hotter.

Climate change and increase in global temperature has become a big issue. We should also gain information about it, so let us try to know in simple language what is climate change? What are the main issues related to it?

Fossil fuels are not renewable sources of energy. They are available in limited quantities only. The remains of dead animals and plants turn into such fuels over a long period of time. This process takes millions of years to complete. It needs to be used very sparingly, otherwise it may end completely.

Water harvesting means storing or saving rainwater in various ways. Apart from ponds or lakes, rainwater can also be collected through tanks built underground. This water can be easily used for gardening and irrigation. It helps in maintaining the groundwater level.

Deforestation means cutting down forests or forest areas for urban activities. Deforestation is also called Nirvanikaran in Hindi. Cutting down forests for farming, mining or building construction etc. is an example of this. Trees play a very important role in the carbon cycle. They provide photosynthesis (photosynthesis)

Birds migrate to find optimal breeding sites and feeding areas. Traditionally, these journeys are made in such a way that birds arrive at breeding sites when food sources—such as insects and plants—are abundant.

Climate change is not just a buzzword. It is a phenomenon that is causing significant changes in our natural world. One of the most noticeable impacts is the change in bird migration patterns. For centuries many bird species have followed predictable routes and timing, but these patterns are changing rapidly as global temperatures rise.
Birds migrate to find optimal breeding sites and feeding areas. Traditionally, these journeys are made in such a way that birds arrive at breeding sites when food sources—such as insects and plants—are abundant. However, due to rising temperatures these resources are now becoming available earlier in the year.
Changing bird migration
Warmer causes plants to bloom and insects to emerge earlier, forcing birds to alter their migration schedules. As a result, many species are now arriving earlier at their breeding grounds. However, not all species are able to adjust so quickly to these changing conditions.
For example, the Himalayan Monal, a beautiful pheasant found in the hilly regions of the Himalayas, is experiencing shifts in the timing of plant growth and insect emergence. This mismatch results in the Monal seeking food sources that are either depleted or not abundant, affecting their ability to breed and raise their young successfully.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A total of 1,609 scientists, including several Nobel Prize winners, have signed a declaration entitled “There Is No Climate Emergency”. This text was promoted by the Climate Intelligence Foundation (CLINTEL). “Climate science should be less political, while climate policy should be more scientific”, the text states.

“There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no reason for panic and alarm. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic Net Zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050. Focus on adaptation instead of mitigation; adaptation works regardless of the causes”, said the group of scientists.

They argue that this gas is “essential” for our planet. They also argue that “the Earth’s climate has varied since the planet existed, and the planet has gone through several cold and warm phases”.

Two “Nobel Prize winners”

American physicists Ivar Giaever and John F. Clauser, Nobel Prize winners in 1973 and 2022 respectively, have joined the declaration against the climate change crisis.

They said that “the popular narrative about climate change reflects a dangerous corruption of science that threatens the global economy and the well-being of billions of people”.

A Spaniard among the signatories

The Mallorcan Luis Pomar, a geologist and professor emeritus at the University of the Balearic Islands, is on the list of scientists who reject climate change. The Spaniard was the first to win the Sorby Medal from the International Association of Sedimentology.

Points of the declaration

The text entitled “There is no climate emergency” includes the following points:

– The geological record reveals that the Earth’s climate has varied since the planet existed, with natural cold and warm phases. The Little Ice Age ended in 1850. So it is no surprise that we are now experiencing a period of warming.

– The world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCC based on modelled anthropogenic impact. The gap between the real world and the modelled world tells us that we are far from understanding climate change.

– Climate models are deeply flawed and are not at all plausible as global policy tools. They exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2. Furthermore, they ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial.

– CO2 is not a pollutant. It is essential for life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is good for nature, it makes the Earth greener: the extra CO2 in the air has boosted the growth of the world’s plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, as it increases crop yields worldwide.

– There is no statistical evidence that global warming is making hurricanes, floods, droughts and similar natural disasters more frequent or more frequent. However, there is ample evidence that CO2 mitigation measures are harmful and costly.

There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic policy of Net Zero CO2 emissions proposed for 2050. If better approaches emerge, and they undoubtedly will, we will have plenty of time to reflect and adapt. The goal of global policy should be “prosperity for all” through the provision of reliable and affordable energy at all times. In a prosperous society, men and women are well educated, birth rates are low and people care about the environment.","['CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science', 'CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Climate change is beneficial', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement']","['CC: Downplaying climate change: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Scientific community is unreliable', 'CC: Downplaying climate change: Humans and nature will adapt to the changes', 'CC: Climate change is beneficial: CO2 is beneficial', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy', 'CC: Downplaying climate change: Climate cycles are natural', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Methodologies/metrics used are unreliable/faulty', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist']",0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""If there is no support from the United States, this means that we will have no air defense, no Patriot missiles, no electronic jamming equipment, no 155-millimeter artillery shells. This means that we will retreat, step by step, small steps [from the battlefield],"" Zelensky said.

He added that Ukraine is facing problems with air defense, and said that without support from the US Congress there will be a shortage of missiles.

""Without the support of the [US] Congress, we will have a serious shortage of missiles. This is a problem. We are building our own air defense systems, but this is not enough."" According to him, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to find a way to not retreat in the combat zone. ""If the situation on the front remains stable, then in the rear Ukraine will be able to arm and train new brigades to launch a new counteroffensive attempt this year,"" the Ukrainian president said. Last summer, Ukrainian troops launched an attempted counteroffensive that turned out to be a failure. During this period, almost 166,000 Ukrainian soldiers were killed, 800 tanks were destroyed, including half of the German Leopard tanks, as well as 123 aircraft and 2,400 armored vehicles. Earlier, Fox News, citing a letter from White House Office of Management and Budget chief Shalanda Young to Senator J.D. Vance, reported that the US government has spent at least $113 billion on aid to Ukraine.

However, as CIA Director Robert Burns said in mid-March, without additional military assistance from Washington, the Kiev authorities will have to agree to peace talks on Russia's terms within a year. He stressed that the lack of American support would result in a further withdrawal and loss of territory for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military', 'URW: Overpraising the West: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""The Russian economy is currently growing strongly thanks to the defence boom,"" says Vasily Astrov, a Russian affairs expert at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw).

However, he says, ""sanctions can act as a slow-acting poison,"" the expert stressed in reference to the conclusions of the study commissioned by the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

In 2023, a year after the start of the war, Russia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.6%. This year, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced a 5% increase in the first five months of the year compared to the same period last year, with growth in the areas of industrial production, machinery and equipment and intellectual property.

""This figure is significantly higher than expected, despite all attempts from abroad to prevent us from doing so,"" Mishustin said at a meeting on economic issues, as quoted by the Tass news agency.

The Russia Monitor project, the result of a research cooperation between the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (WIIW, coordinator), the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW), the Leibniz Institute for Economic Research (IFO) and the Austrian Institute for Economic Research (WIFO), covers data on Russian exports and imports (including sanctioned and dual-use goods), the state budget, the manufacturing sector, domestic demand, the labour market, price developments and financial markets.

It was developed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions imposed by the European Union (EU) and other states on Moscow with the aim of restricting its ability to wage war and increasing the political and economic costs for the country's elites.

Russia's GDP growth has been attributed to increased government spending on weapons and military equipment, with wage increases and payments to families of war victims increasing the income of many families.

The Russian military offensive on Ukrainian territory, launched on February 24, 2022, has plunged Europe into what is considered the most serious security crisis since the Second World War (1939-1945).

Ukraine has been relying on financial and weapons aid from its Western allies, who have also imposed sanctions on key sectors of the Russian economy in an attempt to reduce Moscow's ability to finance the war effort.

The past few months have been marked by large-scale Russian airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, while Kyiv's forces have targeted targets in Russian territory close to the border and on the Crimean peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014.

Now in the third year of war, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been struggling with a shortage of soldiers and weapons and ammunition, despite repeated promises of help from Western allies, which have now begun to materialize.","['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday he aims to have a plan ready by November to allow Kiev to hold a second international summit on its vision for peace in the country's conflict, adding that representatives from Russia should attend.

Ukraine hosted delegations from 92 countries at a first summit in Switzerland last month to present its peace plan. Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, was not invited to the event and dismissed its relevance.

""I have set a goal that by November we will have a fully prepared plan,"" Zelensky told a news conference in Kiev. ""I think that representatives of Russia should be present at the second summit.""

Zelensky made the remarks after returning from a visit to Washington for a summit of the Western military alliance North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) last week.

Ukrainian officials have previously said Russian representatives could be invited to a new summit.

Russia’s deputy foreign minister said last week that Moscow would not participate in a new summit. The Kremlin was less categorical, saying there was “no precise substance” to the idea of ​​a second summit.

The first summit discussed three of the 10 points presented by Ukraine as Zelensky’s “formula” for peace, including food security, nuclear safety and the release of prisoners of war and children.

Ukrainian officials said the second summit would discuss a plan drawn up in advance by dozens of countries divided into working groups.

Zelensky said officials would likely meet in Qatar in late July or early August to agree on a position on energy security. A meeting on food security is expected to take place in Turkey in August, and another in Canada in September on prisoners of war and children, he said.",['URW: Discrediting Ukraine'],['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For the Agriculture Minister, this project will bring “competitiveness” to the region and will “help” territorial cohesion and sustainability

The Agriculture Minister today criticized the “green radicals” who are protesting against the construction of dams and warned that projects related to the sector need to be simplified and the existing bureaucracy done away with.

“What we have to do next is another job, which is simplification, which is to eliminate bureaucracy. I know that in this country there are a lot of people who are paid to create problems, basically, and not to solve them, but this is something that has to end,” said José Manuel Fernandes.

The minister, who was speaking at the signing ceremony for the contract for the construction of the irrigation network for the Xévora hydro-agricultural project in Campo Maior, in the district of Portalegre, gave as an example the slowness that often leads to obtaining, for example, an environmental impact statement.

“An environmental impact statement cannot take five years; it is a huge loss for that to happen. Fortunately, we have a prime minister who not only considers agriculture to be strategic and structural, but also has this objective of simplification, this objective of accelerating processes”, he stressed.

“Water is a priority for agriculture. It confuses me a bit that there are, for example, radicals, as I call them, green radicals, who are against the construction of dams, against water storage. This would promote deserts in a number of places, it would be against the environment”, he added.

Later, speaking to journalists, José Manuel Fernandes stressed that agriculture “is not an enemy” of the environment and that dams help biodiversity and the environment and combat climate change.

“There are those who want to eliminate dams, which would be a disaster, leading not only to the abandonment of the territory but also to an increase in drought and environmental problems”, he lamented.

The Government will move forward with the construction of the irrigation network for the Xévora Hydro-Agricultural Project, starting from the Abrilongo Dam, in an investment that could exceed 25 million euros.

The investment, financed by the Rural Development Programme (PDR) 2020, must be completed physically and financially by the end of 2025, followed by another phase of the project by 2026, which includes the construction of the irrigation pumping station and the reservoir.

The project, at this stage, involves an investment of over 17 million euros and will benefit an area of ​​1,560 hectares, with a pipeline network of 44 kilometres.

For the Minister of Agriculture, this project will bring “competitiveness” to the region and will “help” with territorial cohesion and sustainability.

During the ceremony, the president of the Xévora Beneficiaries Association, Luís Minas, explained that the association “must be a partner” in this project, recalling that it was the beneficiaries who bore the costs of the environmental impact study project.

Also present at the ceremony, the mayor of Campo Maior, Luis Rosinha, said that this was “a very important day” for the municipality, as this is a project “very much desired” by the entire population.","['CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Britain’s King Charles III, a lifelong campaigner on environmental issues, has installed solar panels at Windsor Castle and plans to convert the British royal family’s Bentley cars to run on biofuel, palace officials said.

Charles has installed solar panels on part of the Windsor Castle estate known as the Lord Chamberlain’s Upper Store, replacing the existing lead roof. More panels are planned to be added in the future, officials said.

The royal family owns Bentley limousines, which will be converted to run on biofuel next year as an interim step before the fleet goes electric, officials said. The king has long been outspoken on environmental conservation, and in 2020 described global warming and climate change as the greatest threat humanity has ever faced.

Palace officials made the announcement as they explained the details of the annual report on taxpayer-funded income and expenditure, known as the Sovereign Grant.

The document showed that official expenditure for 2023-24 was £89.1m (€106.4m), up from the £86.3m earmarked, forcing the royal household to dip into reserves to fund the deficit, albeit less than last year.

The emergency monitoring and possible removal of dolphins from Lake Tefé, in Amazonas, found two carcasses of these animals, the Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development reported today (2). The mobilization, carried out over the weekend, occurred after the death of more than 100 aquatic mammals, such as the red dolphin and the tucuxi, which lived in the area.

On Saturday (30), the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) sent teams of veterinarians and staff from the Aquatic Mammal Center (CMA) and the Environmental Emergency Division to determine the causes of the extreme mortality of these mammals. In addition to the drought, the hypothesis is that the heat is causing the deaths of fish and mammals in the region.

The mobilization involves partner organizations, such as Mamirauá, with actions to monitor animals still alive, search for and collect carcasses, collect water samples for disease analysis and monitor the water temperature, which reached 40 degrees Celsius (ºC).

“We continue the operation to monitor the temperature of the lake. On the 28th, the temperature reached 39.1°C, dropped to 37ºC on Friday and 32ºC on Saturday. However, yesterday, at 4 pm, it rose to 37.8°C and we are very alert. There is still no major progress in determining the cause of death, but temperature continues to be the main candidate for the cause of mortality,” Mamirauá Institute member Ayan Fleischmann told Agência Brasil.

According to Fleischmann, there is still no update on the rescue of the animals still alive that are in the lake. On Friday (29), Mamirauá issued a warning to the population living near Lake Tefé to avoid contact with the lake's waters and also recreational use.

In an interview with the Viva Maria program on Rádio Nacional da Amazónia, the coordinator of the Mamirauá Amazonian Aquatic Mammal Research Group, Miriam Marmontel, stated on Saturday (30) that these animals end up acting as sentinels of water quality and are the first to be affected by changes caused in the environment.

""They gave us the warning and now we have to be aware of it. The tendency, if we don't change our habits, is for these events to continue happening.

Nobel Peace Prize winner, former US vice president and climate activist, Albert Gore Junior, better known as Al Gore, stated this Monday, the 7th, that, a few days ago, Brazil “chose to stop destroying the Amazon”. In an impassioned speech at the summit of leaders of the Climate Conference (COP-27), he argued that global leaders have a “trust problem” when it comes to combating climate change and advocated investing in what he called a “sustainable revolution”.

Al Gore did not mention Jair Bolsonaro or Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva by name during his speech. However, on October 30, as soon as the PT candidate's victory was confirmed, the activist congratulated the president-elect on his victory and said that “the world expects renewed leadership from Brazil in driving solutions to the climate crisis and in containing biodiversity loss”.

“We are talking and starting to act, but we are not doing enough. It is a choice to continue this pattern of destructive behavior. I believe we have other options,” he said. He stressed that we are in the early stages of a “sustainable revolution,” which has the “magnitude of the Industrial Revolution” and the “speed of the digital revolution.” “If we invest in this and stop subsidizing the culture of death, we can save ourselves,” he argued. “Every dollar spent on renewable energy creates three times more jobs than dollars spent on fossil fuels.

Brazil's Minister of State for the Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, received the Hugo Werneck Award for environmentalist of the year at a ceremony held on Tuesday (2) at the Convention Center of the Belo Horizonte Shopkeepers' Club (CDL-BH). During the ceremony, the manager asked for the support of the National Congress with the agenda related to environmental preservation and revealed that the federal government hopes to double the resources available for the Climate Fund.

“The government needs to overcome the difficulties with Congress, which understands that certain structures are a cost. I think it is not a cost, it is an investment. The climate authority will help with the challenge of climate extremes. Right here in Minas Gerais, we are living with torrential rains and rising temperatures,” said the minister.

Marina Silva stated that the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) will work “within budgetary possibilities” to build “new structures” related to environmental preservation. “Civil society and the scientific community are doing their part. Those who are not doing their part are governments and companies,” she claimed.

Climate Fund

The minister also commented on the Climate Fund, a Brazilian government instrument created to finance projects, studies and ventures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change. The initiative already has 10 billion reais in resources and, according to Marina, the government expects to expand to 20 billion reais.

“The Climate Fund is for the entire country. It is 10 billion euros for projects in the area of ​​urban mobility, mainly electrification of urban fleets, reforestation and water resources, bioeconomy, infrastructure for sustainable development. We are investing in the new economy. Projects that aim to tackle climate change,” he stated.

Municipalization of environmental preservation actions

Journalist and environmentalist Hiram Firmino, creator of the Hugo Werneck Award, classifies the environmental issue as revolutionary and advocates the participation of municipalities in the agenda. “The world has changed, because pain is educational. People are feeling climate change firsthand. We are talking about the municipalization of environmental management,” he claims.

The Hugo Werneck Award, created in 2010, is a national reference in the fight for environmental preservation. It recognizes and publicizes the best projects, cases and actions in favor of the environment and sustainability, with more than a thousand applications and 170 winners and honorees.

The award has become a landmark in the Brazilian environmental calendar, raising awareness in society about the importance of protecting the planet and fighting climate change.

Inspired by the legacy of Hugo Werneck (1919-2008), one of the pioneers of ecological awareness in Latin America, the award encourages society's participation in building a greener future.","['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other']",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The world’s largest iceberg is moving for the first time in more than 30 years. The iceberg, called A23a, broke off the coast of Antarctica in the late 1980s and was until now a fixed “ice island” in the Weddell Sea, a region disputed between the United Kingdom and Argentina – a reality that has been changing in the last year.

With an impressive 4,000 square kilometers in area (more than 40 times the size of the city of Lisbon) and 400 meters deep, the recent movement of A23a has put the scientific community on alert.

“It had been stationary since 1986, but eventually it would shrink enough in size that it would lose adhesion and start moving,” Andrew Fleming, a specialist at the British Antarctic Survey, told the BBC, adding that the first movements of the shelf began to be seen “in 2020”.

In recent months, the intensity of this movement has increased, partly due to a change in winds and sea currents. A23a is now close to passing the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. From there, it will probably set a course towards the South Atlantic – a path that has already been called “iceberg alley”.

Originally part of the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf, the ice mass broke away from the coast in 1986. At the time, it had a Soviet research station on its surface, which led Moscow to send an expedition to rescue the equipment and research.

A23a’s drift comes at a time when another round of international climate debates is expected – a fact that prompted a visit by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, to Antarctica, where he once again warned of the tragedy of climate change.

“What happens in Antarctica does not stay in Antarctica. (…) We are witnessing an acceleration that is completely devastating,” said Guterres, who described the upcoming COP28 meeting in Dubai as an opportunity to agree on a period for energy transition and the move away from fossil fuels. “Antarctica is waking up, and the world must wake up with it,” he added.",['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Announcing the new restrictions in a video posted on his Telegram channel, Gladkov said that starting next week, only adult men accompanying military or government officials will be allowed to enter the settlements. Men must travel in armored vehicles and wear bulletproof vests and helmets, he added.

“I hope you will agree that it is unacceptable to allow women and children to enter the settlements that are shelled every day,” Gladkov said.

Spanish police arrested three people on Saturday (20) accused of having participated in cyberattacks by a pro-Russian group against public institutions and strategic sectors of the country and other NATO members.

The attacks were directed against countries supporting Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, which began in February 2024.

Two of the suspects were detained in Huelva and Seville, in southern Spain, while the third was detained in the Balearic Islands, a statement from the Civil Guard said.

They were detained for “crimes of computer damage for terrorist purposes”. The three people are believed to have participated in attacks organized by the Russian-linked hacker group “NoName057(16)”, according to the statement.

“The main activity of this group is to carry out distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against websites of public and private organizations in the government sector, critical infrastructures and essential services,” the Civil Guard stated.

The security agency detailed that the group’s main activity consisted of organizing DDoS attacks with “software developed by the group itself (…), called DDoSia” and which can be “voluntarily used by individuals who support the purposes of this organization”.

439,PT_46.txt,"Running Out of Time, Ukrainian Armed Forces Commander Announces Leadership Changes

The newly installed commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Aleksandr Syrsky, said he plans to make further changes to the military leadership and general staff, bringing in more officers who have gained experience during the conflict.

According to Bloomberg, Syrsky said that “our headquarters must know all the needs on the battlefield and understand the situation on each part of the front. And for this, the skills of the officers who are part of the military administration come to the fore.”

The media reported that the commander did not say how many officers who served under his predecessor, General Valery Zaluzhny, would be replaced or provide any other details.

Ukraine’s military has struggled to make gains in recent months, as Russia outnumbers Ukrainian forces six to one in artillery shells.

Meanwhile, after a review of internal resources, the Ukrainian military plans to recruit “significantly” fewer people than the 500,000 initially discussed, Syrsky said, without providing a new figure.

“We hope to have enough people to protect the homeland, and we are talking not only about conscripts, but also about volunteers,” he said.

After Ukraine’s 2023 counteroffensive failed to break through entrenched Russian lines, Kiev is starting to build its own fortifications, with some critics questioning why this was not started earlier, media reports said.

In the commander’s interpretation, Russia “will continue its offensive along a wide front” and aims to reach the borders of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions “at any cost,” as well as reach more territories in Zaporozhye, Syrsky said.

“We are preparing solid defense lines in almost all threatened directions,” he added.

Last month, the fall of Avdeevka and several nearby towns fueled fears that Kiev's defenses may not be able to hold, with Ukrainian officials worried that Russian advances could gain significant momentum by the summer, as reported.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Climate change seems to be of little concern to participants at the Republican convention in Milwaukee, which met to endorse Donald Trump as a candidate for the US elections in November.

“I don’t believe in any of this,” says Jack Prendergast, a delegate from New York at the meeting, convinced that “volcanic eruptions” cause as much damage to the planet as “man’s actions.” He is impatiently awaiting Donald Trump’s return to the White House so that the United States “can become the world’s leading producer of oil and gas.”

Scepticism

The former president, who is running to oust Joe Biden from the White House, has the motto “drill, baby, drill,” which sums up his support for the exploration and use of fossil fuels.

Trump, who regularly makes skeptical comments about the climate, denounced the Paris Agreement during his first term.

This week, Republicans endorsed his candidacy for a second term. Trump has chosen Senator J.D. Vance, also a climate skeptic, as his running mate. The Ohio senator, who will become vice president if Trump is elected, has in the past accused Democrats of stoking fears about the “environmental crisis” for electoral gain. The platform that the two will defend in the elections was adopted on Monday by Republican delegates in Milwaukee. The 5,000-word document makes no mention of climate change or renewable energy, despite the country suffering from a heat wave. Instead, the text calls for an end to “green” measures, which it calls “socialist.” Trump himself opposes wind power, convinced that the turbines “kill birds.” Long-term work Environmentalists such as the Sunrise Movement have criticized the Republican platform, saying that the party “has made it clear that it is happy to make the climate crisis worse.” “We have to look at their words with a little perspective,” smiles Stephen Perkins of the American Conservation Coalition, which may have had the only booth at the Milwaukee convention discussing the preservation of the planet. “I think some of their comments are more intended to entertain than to express political positions,” the 29-year-old told AFP. His organization is present at this large Milwaukee sports center to advocate for a “conservative approach to climate policy,” which could allow Republicans to “win over” the youth vote, he believes. “It’s a long-term task,” admits Perkins, referring to a “natural aversion” to the issue, especially among older Republicans. Radical sect According to a Yale poll released Tuesday, more than two-thirds of Americans believe that climate change exists. However, this does not necessarily translate into support for Democratic President Joe Biden, who has promoted several initiatives to combat global warming during his term. Perkins, on the other hand, believes Biden is at the mercy of a “radical sect” of progressives “who don’t care about nuance.” His convention booth features the word “destruction” alongside images of left-wing environmental activists throwing soup at a work of art.","['CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Controversy about green technologies']","['CC: Downplaying climate change: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous']",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

American billionaire and businessman Elon Musk believes that if Ukraine doesn't agree to negotiate with Russia, the country could lose all access to the Black Sea. According to Musk, the longer the conflict lasts, ""the more territory Russia will gain.""

""If the war lasts long enough, Odessa will fall. In my opinion, the main question is whether Ukraine will lose all access to the Black Sea or not. I would advise resolving the conflict through negotiations before that happens,"" Musk said on the social network X.

According to the businessman, ""attacking a larger army with deep defense, minefields and strong artillery, when Ukraine had no superiority in either armor or air, was a tragedy in terms of loss of life.""

Moscow has repeatedly indicated that it is willing to negotiate, while Kiev has prohibited any dialogue to end the conflict. The West, which supports the government of President Vladimir Zelensky, is putting pressure on the country not to start negotiations.

The Russian government has previously stated that there are no prerequisites for a peaceful solution with the achievement of the objectives of the special operation, which can currently only be achieved militarily.

The situation in Ukraine can become peaceful only if the new realities and the actual situation are taken into account, and all of Moscow's requirements are well known.

Moscow, June 4. TASS. The Ukrainian government has approved a plan for 2024, which includes over 200 reforms and about 400 indicators of their implementation, which were developed in accordance with the recommendations of Western partners. This was reported at a cabinet meeting by Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal.

""We have officially approved the reform matrix and the procedure for monitoring compliance with the recommendations and conditions that our international partners provided us. Over 200 reforms are planned for 2024. About 400 indicators of their implementation have been formed,"" Shmygal said on the cabinet website.

According to the Prime Minister, the framework is a “huge plan for change”, which includes reforms, as well as officially approved recommendations and documents from the European Commission, structural beacons from the IMF, a plan for the EU aid program Ukraine Facility and the conditions of the World Bank, with the help of which this framework was developed. He added that the reforms cover both the economic sector and institutional changes, including law enforcement reform and anti-corruption policies. 

Western allies, on whose aid Ukraine depends, are increasingly linking the continuation of this support, as well as the country’s European integration process, to the fulfillment of a number of conditions, including changes in legislation. In the fall of 2023, a great resonance in Ukraine was caused by the leak of a letter from the US Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Michael Pyle to the Ukrainian leadership. The document presented a list of priority reforms that Kiev must implement in order to receive assistance from Washington. Verkhovna Rada deputy Yaroslav Zheleznyak called this approach “money for reforms,” and the head of the parliamentary faction of the pro-presidential party Serving the People, David Arachamiya, acknowledged that bills will be a priority for the Rada, the approval of which will depend on continued funding from Western donors.",['URW: Discrediting Ukraine'],['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Ukraine joining NATO would be a declaration of war against Moscow and that only “prudence” on behalf of the alliance could prevent the planet from being torn apart.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders pledged at their summit last week to support Ukraine on an “irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,” but left open the question of when that membership might happen.

Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council and a leading voice among Kremlin hawks, told the Argumenty I Fakty media outlet that Ukraine’s accession would go beyond a direct threat to Moscow’s security.

“This would essentially be a declaration of war – albeit a belated one,” he said in comments published on Wednesday.

“The actions that Russia’s opponents have been taking against us for years, expanding the alliance, are bringing NATO to a point of no return.”

In a standard Kremlin line since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Medvedev said Russia was not threatening NATO but would respond to the alliance’s attempts to advance its interests.

“The more such attempts there are, the harsher our responses will become,” Medvedev said. “Whether this will tear the entire planet apart depends solely on the prudence of the (NATO) side.”","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree on Wednesday on the new Maritime Security Strategy, which envisages ""changes and innovations"", especially in the Black Sea, and which is accompanied by a strategy with international partners.

The Kremlin (Russian presidency) spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, commenting on the Ukrainian initiative, warned that Moscow will take measures to ensure the country's security due to the ""additional threats"" posed by the presence of NATO ships in the area.

""The concentrated presence of NATO ships - and we take into account Bulgaria and Romania, which are NATO littoral states - poses additional threats to Russia, especially in the current situation,"" he said.

Peskov referred, in particular, to the ""direct involvement of NATO countries in the conflict over Ukraine"", according to the Spanish news agency EFE.

""Of course, Russia will take all necessary measures to ensure its own security,"" he said.

Peskov also recalled that ""the presence of non-Black Sea states"" in those waters ""is regulated very strictly by the Montreux Convention"".

""Turkey is, in this case, the administrator and performs its functions very clearly"", he added, quoted by the Spanish agency Europa Press.

Dated 1936, the Montreux Convention gives Turkey control of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits that connect the Black and Mediterranean Seas.

Merchant ships enjoy freedom of passage, but warships are subject to restrictions ""that vary depending on whether or not these ships belong to the Black Sea states"", according to the Turkish government.

The representative of Crimea in the Russian parliament, Mikhail Sheremet, also accused Zelenskyy today of wanting to prolong the conflict with Russia, according to the Russian agency TASS.

Sheremet said that Kiev's new maritime security strategy is aimed at building up Ukrainian naval forces and ensuring the presence of North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in the Black Sea. According to the Crimean MP, if Ukraine's military pressure weakens, Zelensky will no longer be needed by the West and NATO countries will stop supporting him as Ukrainian leader.

The effects of climate change have been part of Brazilians' daily lives for some time now. In May, the country was moved by the plight of the people of Rio Grande do Sul who faced unprecedented devastation caused by inclement rains, which killed more than 180 residents, left cities submerged, destroyed infrastructure and caused billions in losses. In recent months, amid severe droughts and scorching temperatures, fires have spread, destroying vegetation and causing problems for the population. One would expect that such a reality would make climate change one of the main themes of the local government campaign throughout the country. However, this is not the case.

As shown in the GLOBO series of reports “Resilient Cities”, the candidates for mayor seem to ignore the concern, despite the fact that measures to adapt to and mitigate the effects of global warming are mainly a municipal issue. All candidates should address the issue in their government proposals and plans. However, with the exception of the South, where the scars of the rains are still present, the report reveals that most programs deal with the issue vaguely, relegating long-term measures to the background.

The most common promises concern Civil Defense actions (warning systems), drainage works, creation of parks or planting trees. Not that such initiatives are unimportant. But the climate emergency demands more. Candidates should clearly explain their policies to avoid the occupation of areas susceptible to disasters (such as hillsides and riverbanks) and strategies to relocate vulnerable families. Even if unpopular, these are essential measures to minimize the effects of tragedies resulting from extreme weather events, which are increasingly frequent.

As municipalities are responsible for regulating land use, they bear a fundamental responsibility in preventing catastrophes. The tragedy in Rio Grande do Sul showed that the occupation of cities needs to be rethought. There is no way to prevent rivers from overflowing or hillsides from sliding under torrential rain, but it is possible to reduce the effects of tragedies by better planning for occupation. Certain areas, due to obvious risks, cannot be used for housing. However, only 13% of Brazilian cities have a specific plan to reduce the risk of disasters, according to a survey by the Iyaleta Research Association. Less than a third have a master plan for flood prevention. Only 8% have warning systems in place.

In a scenario of more intense extreme events, candidates should present proposals that include reforestation of hillsides, street trees, cooling of transport and schools, and preparation of health networks, with particular attention to children and the elderly. This is no longer a matter of projections for the future. In the middle of winter, Brazilian cities have recorded temperatures above 40 degrees.

Campaigns cannot be so disconnected from reality. It is not unlikely that torrential rains, heat waves, prolonged droughts and devastating fires will occur in the coming weeks, months or years. Cities need to be prepared to respond. During the campaign, candidates may even avoid the issue. But once elected, they will certainly be exposed to it. They cannot claim surprise.","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other']",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Eduardo Oliveira e Sousa from Ribatejo, the bearer of the most lush and bushy moustache in this election campaign, caught the eye last week, and not just because of his well-trimmed hair above his lips. The AD candidate for Santarém spoke of “false climate reasons” that hinder investment, an opinion that, unfortunately, many people do not tolerate these days. Or, if they do, they are afraid to proclaim it in the middle of the hunting season, in search of votes, so as not to upset the most sensitive souls, such as the swarm of political commentators who have been lashing out at the agroforestry entrepreneur who is now running for deputy.

The AD candidate, who until a year ago led the powerful Confederation of Portuguese Farmers (CAP) and the CNEMA in Santarém, limited himself to sharing what was on his mind and which is his full conviction. Of him and many other people, it must be said. And to his rescue, in a gesture of solidarity that suggests that the news about climate change is clearly exaggerated, was also Saint Peter. In the days following Oliveira e Sousa's fearless statements, the saint in charge of climate matters gave us rain, wind, cold and snow in the highlands, as if to show that tradition is still what it used to be, and so is winter. What climate change, what a hood! It even rained during Carnival, remember?

In that election rally in Ourém, Oliveira e Sousa emphasized, in fact, that extreme weather phenomena have always existed. And he emphasized it very well, too! Those more delicate and picky spirits would have had to deal with an ice age when there were no Alentejo samurai, salamanders or hot water bottles; or that they had faced a flood of biblical proportions without having life jackets, flippers and rubber boats and would have seen what was good for their cough.

But in the meantime I discovered that little or nothing separated me from those who today are called climate activists (and those of other causes) and who even enjoy a certain sympathy and social reputation, especially among young people.

People today do a lot of things along the same lines - from blocking roads, vandalizing facilities, throwing eggs and paint at people - and all these practices, which some people would once have called vandalism, delinquency or rioting, are now manifestations of activism because they are carried out by the euphemistically designated activists.

Extreme weather events are on the rise. Huge forest fires, severe droughts, torrential rains, major floods, violent heat waves, etc. are occurring one after the other.

How can such clear signs be ignored and the energy transition be halted by consuming more fossil fuels? This is a regrettable reaction that is taking shape in several European countries.

This is a way of denying what is obvious. Years ago, it was still possible to consider the imperative of reducing CO2 emissions a fantasy. Now, denying what is obvious requires greater effort, which some people are making in order to avoid being bothered.

The energy transition has costs, which are easier to ignore. Those who react this way probably think that the final tragedy will only happen when they are no longer around. This is how they condemn future generations. This is irresponsible selfishness.

Unfortunately, political leaders are not always up to the challenge of the crisis that is unfolding. They prefer not to upset people and so avoid taking the drastic measures that are necessary.

Therefore, hope lies in the capacity of the younger generations to protest, so as to force politicians to assume their responsibilities, instead of continuing to calmly act as if the energy transition were not extremely urgent.

Young people protest because they see their lives at risk. They are right.

More than 600 deaths per year: “The summer plan should have been created in January and it doesn’t exist, as well as the contingency plan”.

Portugal is one of the countries with the highest excess mortality due to heat. It exceeded 600 deaths per year between 1990 and 2019.

Carlos Cortes, president of the Portuguese Medical Association, believes that prevention could be more effective: “The summer plan should have been created in January and it doesn’t exist, as well as the contingency plan, which should have been known in April. They are essential for preventing deaths associated with excessive heat and, every year, this is never done”.

“There is a lack of prevention measures and information campaigns for the population. The sensation of thirst is lost with age and older people have to force themselves to drink in times of greater heat”.

The president told Diário de Notícias that the Directorate General of Health (DGS) is responsible for creating prevention plans.

Carlos Cortes warns that heat waves have been increasing year after year, “with an increasingly longer summer period”.

“The most vulnerable groups, such as children, the elderly and people with chronic illnesses that may decompensate, must implement some measures and there is a lack of literacy in this area. Campaigns should have been more intensified”, he adds.

Excessive heat brings several disadvantages. One of them is the change in our ecosystem: “There are diseases that were typical of Africa that are beginning to appear in Southern Europe. The diseases we have are not the same because viruses and bacteria that live in a warmer environment develop differently, compared to how they do in a temperate climate”.

Precisely in this context, doctor Luís Cadinha points out that mosquitoes that carry Zika or dengue fever have stopped reaching “just one part of the Algarve and have spread throughout the area and have already been detected in Lisbon”.

“Although mosquitoes only transmit diseases when infected, we have a new population in Portugal. This change in temperature makes our country a more suitable habitat for mosquitoes”, warns the public health doctor.

There are also more ticks. “Ticks remain active for longer and not only in the summer – and these are the ones that carry diseases that affect us. They start earlier and stop being active later. They used to be active between May and September and now they start in March and remain until November”.

Luís Cadinha also warns about the increased frequency of heat waves. For comparison: there were only “two or three” between 2000 and 2005, and in 2023 alone there have been three heat waves.","['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
450,PT_164.txt,"Portugal must demand the release of Captain Paul Watson, the whale protector

Captain Paul Watson has been tirelessly sailing the world's seas for decades to defend whales. The founder of Sea Shepherd does nothing more than ensure compliance with the law, since whales are supposedly protected by international law. Whaling has been officially banned since a moratorium adopted by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) came into force in 1986. The aim of this organization is to defend life at sea through a unique strategy of aggressive non-violence and intervention against illegal operations that exploit life at sea. To date, it has helped save more than 5,000 cetaceans!

Currently, only three countries are determined not to comply with the moratorium: Iceland, Norway and Japan. Japan was already condemned by the International Court of Justice in 2014 for its whaling activities, which were subsequently covered up by false claims of scientific research. The famous captain, who is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by Tokyo for ""conspiracy to commit a collision"", was arrested on 21 July by the Danish authorities, while his boat was making a discreet stopover in Greenland. Since then, international public opinion has been mobilised to demand Paul Watson's release, notably through a petition launched by journalist Hugo Clément, which has more than 700,000 signatures. French President Emmanuel Macron has already intervened with the Danish authorities to try to prevent his extradition to Japan. Whaling, as well as the persecution of activists who protect it, is increasingly incomprehensible, since this is an activity that is not only illegal, but goes far beyond the protection of a species. Today we know that whales play a fundamental role in mitigating climate change. Scientists have recently discovered that whales can capture significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere. Estimates indicate that a whale’s ability to capture carbon from the atmosphere is equal to that of thousands of trees. In 2019, the International Monetary Fund itself published a study in which the value of the services provided by a whale (which includes the capture of carbon dioxide) “is more than 2 million dollars and easily more than one trillion dollars for the current population of large whales.”

Whales are an essential part of a solution to the climate crisis. Carbon dioxide capture is around 30 to 40 times more efficient in the marine environment, in which whales play a fundamental role. Therefore, the undersigned urge the Portuguese Government to join the other governments that have already embraced this cause, by taking all necessary steps to ensure that the Danish Government does not extradite Captain Paul Watson and also calling on the Japanese authorities to comply with international law.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
451,PT_170.txt,"The Amazon will have a slow recovery due to climate phenomena

The general coordinator of Earth Sciences at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Gilvan Sampaio, says that the southwest of the Amazon will receive rain again from November, but the precipitation will be below average and the recovery will probably be slow.

“The rainfall deficit was very large, it will still have repercussions in November and will gradually recover”, he said.

Due to the influence of El Niño, according to him, rainfall will be above average in the South and, combined with the temperature anomaly in the North Atlantic, rainfall volumes will be below average in the North of Brazil in the coming months.

He says that, for Rondônia, the outlook is for below-average rainfall. “This is the area where the Madeira River basin is located, which makes an important contribution to the Amazon River”, he explained.

The Madeira is the main tributary of the Amazon. Natural flows in Porto Velho (RO) are 51% below average in October.

Researcher sees relationship between drought in Rio Negro and global warming

The data are included in maps from the joint bulletin of INPE, the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) and Funceme.

Last Friday (27), INPE's director-general, Clézio De Nardin, explained the situation to senators in a session dedicated to discussing the effects of climate phenomena such as El Niño.

""There is a very serious drought in the western Amazon and it will spread to the east. Today in Manaus and on to Pará. It is serious"", he warned.

He explained that the data indicate that the Northeast will suffer from drought starting in February, March and April.

""Get ready! The Northeast will suffer from rainfall well below average. This is already motivating the organizations to take appropriate preventive actions, mainly social"", he warned.

INPE data indicate the largest increase in temperature ever recorded in the North Atlantic, which inhibits the growth of transpiration in the Amazon.

“The cycle of temperature increase in the North Atlantic carries the currents and when it reaches the Amazon, it forces the air current downwards, preventing the formation of clouds, preventing rain and this causes droughts”, he explained.

In addition to this, there are the El Niño currents. With part of the Pacific warming, the ocean winds that flow in an east-west direction over the Andes Mountains form a kind of barrier over Brazilian territory, causing cold fronts to circulate more slowly over the southern region.

“The cold currents enter the southern region very slowly, causing extreme rainfall and well below average in the rest of the country”, he said.

The director highlighted the investment of around 32.7 million euros by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) in the Renovation of INPE's Supercomputing Infrastructure.

The resources from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FNDCT) will be used to acquire the new supercomputer, install a photovoltaic plant to meet the machine's energy demand, and develop Monan – the Model for Forecasting Oceans, Continental Surfaces and Atmosphere.

""I do not exclude any option,"" said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov when asked about the possibility of deploying nuclear missiles if the United States of America (USA) confirms its decision, adding that such actions imply ""the definitive end of arms control agreements in that area.""

""In this situation, taking into account the combined capabilities of NATO member countries, we must evaluate our responses, without any internal limitations in terms of what, where and when [missiles] should or should not be deployed. This means that the options should be as broad as possible,"" the official noted, quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax.

In this sense, the deputy minister said that Russia's position ""does not pose a threat to anyone, it is simply seeking the most effective way, also in terms of costs, to respond to changing challenges.""

Ryabkov also assured that the Russian authorities will guarantee the security of the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad (a Russian enclave in the Baltic bordering Lithuania and Poland, two countries in the European Union and NATO), which has ""long attracted the attention of adversaries"".

""Should the representatives of the German government consider it justified to initiate measures for an escalation under the pretext of the situation in the region, we will respond with compensatory measures in the manner we consider most acceptable"", he stressed.

""Nothing will stop us from solving the problems for our security along the entire perimeter of the Russian borders"", he stressed.

Last week, Ryabkov had considered that ""the nature of Russia's reaction"" - should the US decide on such a measure, which would involve the first American shipment of these weapons to Germany since the end of the Cold War - ""will be decided calmly and professionally"".

The danger is “increasingly clear”: While we are keeping an eye on climate threats from the south, such as tropical diseases, threats from the thawing north may be emerging simultaneously.

Global health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO), are sounding the alarm about a potential new health crisis: the awakening of ancient “zombie viruses” originating from permafrost — the permanently frozen layer of the earth’s surface.

Some of these pathogens are up to 50,000 years old and were unearthed from layers of Siberian permafrost, according to research shared in a Bloomberg report on Monday. Concerns have intensified in the post-Covid-19 era, given the lack of immunity and treatments available for these viruses.

The main culprit for the awakening of these giant zombies is, once again, global warming, which is, as you read this article, thawing this permanent layer. With the Arctic set to be ice-free by the summers of the 2030s, the release of ancient pathogens presents a new frontier of risk. Alongside greenhouse gases such as methane, pathogens dormant in permafrost pose an underappreciated danger. Last year, according to the Financial Express, a team led by Aix-Marseille University professor Jean-Michel Claverie, who is studying these zombies, published research that found that multiple ancient viruses extracted from Siberian permafrost were still infectious. The danger is “increasingly clear” The revival of pathogens is not just theoretical. An anthrax outbreak in Siberia in 2016, triggered by a heatwave, resulted in numerous infections and led to the deaths of thousands of reindeer and a child. A separate study this year also managed to revive a 46,000-year-old roundworm, adding another layer of concern. According to Claverie, the danger is “increasingly clear”: while we typically think of climate threats emanating from the south, such as tropical diseases, threats could also be emerging from the melting north.

The WHO has been monitoring unknown infectious diseases for which humans have neither immunity nor medical therapies to treat them. The organization has included a generic “Disease X” on its list of priority pathogens requiring urgent investigation.

André Ventura confirmed the presence of Jair Bolsonaro and Matteo Salvini, the two “friends” of Vladimir Putin who only visit Portugal after electoral defeats, at a far-right summit scheduled for May 13 and 14.

Bolsonaro, who has never visited Portugal as president of Brazil, has at least 8 legal proceedings pending against him.

In July 2022, 5 months after Russia invaded Ukraine, then-president Jair Bolsonaro reaffirmed that Brazil would not adhere to sanctions against Russia and that his relationship with the Russian leader was “exceptional… My relationship with the Russian government is not good, it is exceptional”.

Matteo Salvini, leader of the Northern League, a party that lost more than half of its voters in the last elections in September 2022, risks 15 years in prison where he is accused of “kidnapping” 147 migrants rescued on board a ship operated by the Spanish NGO Open Arms, to whom he denied disembarkation as part of his closed ports policy. The Deputy Prime Minister of Italy, who once again defended the end of sanctions on Russia in September 2022, has never hidden his admiration for Vladimir Putin, to the point of considering him in 2019 as the “best statesman currently on the planet” and having worn a T-shirt with the Russian President’s face printed on it.

Jair Bolsonaro, former President of Brazil, is facing several judicial investigations:

The case of the jewelry offered by Saudi Arabia. Bolsonaro is said to have brought two packages of jewelry that were not declared to the tax authorities.

Genocide crimes against the Yanomami indigenous community. Disobedience, breach of judicial secrecy, and environmental crimes related to the life, health and safety of several indigenous communities.

Incitement to violence in the attacks in Brasília. The Public Prosecutor's Office considers that Jair Bolsonaro shared videos on social media in which he questions the regularity of the Presidential elections, which constitutes public incitement to commit a crime.

Accusations of electoral fraud. Even before the elections, Bolsonaro was already the target of an investigation due to the successive attacks made on the Brazilian electoral system.

Fraud regarding the administration of the vaccine against Covid-19. Bolsonaro's medical records indicate that the former President had taken a dose of the Janssen vaccine on July 19, 2021.

Use of government agencies and resources to benefit his children, who are also the target of judicial investigations.

Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more severe as a result of climate change, experts say.

In Europe, temperatures are rising at twice the rate of the global average.

Some regions of Greece have already recorded temperatures above 40ºC for more than 10 days.

The heat is so intense that the Acropolis of Athens, the country's most visited site, has had to close for several days during the hottest hours of the day.

The economy has also had to adapt to the high temperatures.

In Sicily, since Wednesday, work in agriculture and construction has been prohibited between 12:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. on days when the risk of working outdoors is ""high."" The measure remains in force until August 31.

456,PT_45.txt,"Ukrainian presidential election cancelled: what's next?

Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky's decision not to hold a presidential election in his country, despite his term ending in two months, is unlikely to have a significant impact on his relations with the West, political analyst Bogdan Bezpalko tells Sputnik.

The elections in Ukraine, originally scheduled to take place this Sunday (31), were cancelled under the pretext of martial law declared by President Zelensky. While the authorities in Kiev insisted that this decision was related to the Ukrainian conflict that began in February 2022, there are suspicions that the decision was motivated by Zelensky's ratings in opinion polls.

""He does not want to hold elections because he is afraid of losing them and someone else taking his place. Ukraine is not in a state of war, mobilization has not been officially declared, there are no other attributes associated with a country that is officially in a state of war. Martial law, of course, may allow him to extend his term, but not indefinitely,"" political analyst Bogdan Bezpalko told Sputnik.

Russia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN), Vasily Nebenzya, has already suggested that Zelensky will technically cease to be a legitimate president once his term ends on May 21.

However, Bezpalko noted that Zelensky's presidential term may be extended until August, without mentioning that the regime in Kiev may try to stage some provocation to ""change the judicial status of the conflict"" and thus further escalate the situation.

The analyst added that Zelensky's decision is unlikely to have repercussions in the West, since the current regime in Kiev serves the interests of allied countries. However, if for some reason the West decides to remove Zelensky, it would immediately be declared that he does not legitimately hold office, Bezpalko suggested. While Western powers may make “some timid statements” about Zelensky’s decision not to hold elections, they are unlikely to be followed by any sanctions or a reduction in the flow of Western assistance to Kiev, he added. “He may end up facing some difficulties in his contacts with the West, but he will continue to receive assistance — limited, significantly reduced perhaps, but he will continue to receive assistance,” Bezpalko noted. According to the expert, the question of Zelensky’s legitimacy is a secondary concern, since a replacement would likely not change Ukraine’s position towards Russia or the conflict as a whole. The reason for this, he said, is that it is not just Ukraine or Zelensky himself that is involved in the conflict with Russia, but essentially the entire West. Bezpalko further noted that Zelensky has established an authoritarian regime in Ukraine by trying to deny his political opponents access to the mass media and any material resources.

Furthermore, the president is considered responsible for dragging Ukraine into a conflict that has become an unmitigated disaster in the country, and Zelensky would suffer a major defeat in a free and fair election, Bezpalko concluded.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The suspects were detained on suspicion of being “organizers and participants in criminal schemes involving the embezzlement of budget funds intended to meet the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” it said in a statement on the social network ‘Telegram’.

In a statement, the Prosecutor General's Office stressed that “a large-scale special operation was carried out to uncover the organizers and participants of criminal schemes involving the embezzlement of budget funds allocated to meet the needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” it wrote, noting that “employees of housing maintenance units were found involved in embezzlement in almost all oblasts of Ukraine, in cooperation with representatives of commercial entities.”

The detainees are 15 alleged members of criminal organisations and 15 other local government officials, including, for example, three officials from the city of Kharkiv, or seven from the Lviv, Chernigov or Yitomir regions. Specifically, they are accused of “inflating the prices” of firewood, electricity or natural gas and infrastructure for military use, as well as “illegal acquisition of assets in the form of commercial properties and land”. This is the latest example of the anti-corruption drive promoted by the country’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, following calls from the international community to facilitate its accession process to the European Union and NATO.

The United States is in talks to increase purchases of explosives from Turkey to speed up production of artillery shells. According to media reports, Ankara is on track to become the largest seller of artillery munitions to Washington this year.

Turkish supplies of trinitrotoluene, known as TNT, and nitroguanidine, which is used as a propellant, would be crucial in the production of 155mm munitions, the NATO standard, according to officials familiar with the discussions who spoke to Bloomberg.

The surge in demand has delayed global orders and put pressure on defense supply chains, especially for components such as TNT, the officials said on condition of anonymity.

The Pentagon said in late February that it had contracted General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems to build three metal parts lines for 155mm projectiles in Texas, including Turkish subcontractors. The plant, in Mesquite, Texas, is expected to be operational in June, the company said.

Turkish defense contractor Repkon’s production lines are expected to produce about 30% of all 155mm artillery shells made in the United States by 2025, the people said.

In a statement about the investment in Texas and Turkish industry, the Pentagon said working with allies “is critical to building a global defense industrial base,” the media reported.

In addition, the Defense Department has purchased 116,000 rounds of combat-ready ammunition from Turkey’s Arca Defense for delivery this year, with more expected to be delivered as soon as 2025, the officials added.

The U.S. and European efforts are part of a race to catch up with Moscow, which has the upper hand on the battlefield and has forced Ukrainian troops to abandon strategic locations after assaults. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan plans to visit the White House on May 9 for the first time since President Joe Biden took office, as the two men work to soften military ties. The deal with Ankara also highlights a delicate balance between the NATO allies, whose relations have been strained by Russia’s operation in Ukraine and Turkey’s months-long blockade of Sweden’s accession to the alliance.","['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Five protesters linked to the climate group Just Stop Oil have been found guilty of conspiracy to cause public disorder, The Guardian reported. The activists were given record sentences for non-violent protests for their role in the movement that blocked London's M25 motorway for four consecutive days in November 2022.

Roger Hallam, 58, and co-founder of the climate group, was sentenced to five years in prison. The other four defendants were sentenced to four years.

The five defendants are said to have met on Zoom on 2 November 2022 to discuss the planning of the protest. During the meeting, they are said to have tried to recruit people to block the motorway. A journalist from The Sun is said to have joined the call and sent the recordings to the police.

During the trial that led to the record sentences, 11 protesters were arrested for contempt outside the court. Christopher Hehir, the judge, said that “the disturbance was intricately planned” and that there was “irrefutable evidence” of a conspiracy, as reported by Sky News. Hehir added that the protesters “have appointed themselves as the sole judges of what should be done about climate change” and that they have gone “from concerned to fanatical” for some time now. Climáximo, a Portuguese climate activist group, has expressed its solidarity with Just Stop Oil. In a statement, the group said that the convicted protesters are “political prisoners of a war that fossil fuel companies have declared on society” and compared this situation to the one and a half year suspended sentence given to the eight protesters from the group, who were tried for blocking Avenida Duarte Pacheco in Lisbon on 14 December 2023. Amnesty International has also spoken out against the sentence. “These long sentences for people simply seeking climate justice should raise alarm bells about the ongoing crackdown on peaceful protest in this country. It violates all of our human rights,” said Tom Southerden, legal and human rights adviser at Amnesty UK, as quoted by The Independent.

Prosecutors alleged that the protests, during which 45 people climbed onto motorway gantry cranes, had cost the Metropolitan Police at least £765,000. In addition, the demonstration is said to have cost the Metropolitan Police the equivalent of €1.3 million.

The protests also caused around 50,000 hours of delays and affected 700,000 vehicles, leaving the M25 blocked for more than 120 hours.

A police officer was also left with bruises after being knocked down by a motorbike in traffic.","['CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments']",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is true, when one thought that justice could not surprise, it does, and it is estimated that there are victims of racism and xenophobia who wish that Mário Machado, historic leader of neo-Nazi skinheads and supporter of André Ventura's Chega, would not stop at words and join the Ukrainian troops as soon as possible, preferably on the front line.

Mário Machado shared the request and the court's decision to remove the coercive measure of biweekly presentation for the crime of possession of a prohibited weapon and wrote:

Judge of the Criminal Investigation Court of Lisbon, defers request by Mário Machado, so that the coercive measures applied in the last political process of biweekly presentations, are changed.

Machado requested, through his distinguished lawyer, Dr. José M. Castro, the following: “The serious international crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has mobilized the efforts of thousands of people, mainly in the humanitarian field.

The defendant is not indifferent to this movement.

Therefore, he mobilized a group of people of different nationalities who intend to go to Ukraine to provide humanitarian aid and, if necessary, fight alongside Ukrainian troops.”

The judge issued the ruling: “..considering the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and the purposes invoked by the defendant for his claim, the defendant may not comply with the aforementioned coercive measure while he is abroad.”

""This is a difficult issue. From a legal point of view, it is a problem, but from a practical point of view, we are open to achieving our goals through negotiations. Therefore, several options are possible,"" the presidential spokesman said.

Zelensky's legitimacy as president of Ukraine has been a question raised by Russia, which argues that the Ukrainian leader's term ended on May 20.

The Russian spokesman said that in addition to ""problems with Zelensky's legitimacy"", there is also ""the problem of the ban on establishing any contacts or negotiations with the Russian side, since this ban remains in force"".

""Therefore, there is still a lot to clarify and we need to hear some explanations,"" Peskov said.

Following Zelensky’s recent statements about his readiness to negotiate a peaceful solution to the war in Ukraine, the Russian presidential spokesman stressed that “Russia is generally open to the negotiation process, but it is necessary to understand to what extent the Ukrainian side is prepared.”

“So far, as you can see, we have heard very different statements, so far things are not very clear,” he added.

On Wednesday, Peskov recalled that Russian President Vladimir Putin had stated that “Zelensky has lost legitimacy” after the end of his term, which “is a factor that can significantly hinder the peace process.”

The spokesman also stressed that Russia will ensure the defence of its interests and security in any case, whether through negotiations or weapons.

“The special military operation was launched as a last resort to achieve our goals,” Peskov said, stressing that “any war ends with peace negotiations.”

In recent days, Zelensky has stressed the need for negotiations to end the war as soon as possible.

The Ukrainian president has recently held talks with political representatives in favour of an immediate ceasefire, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba travelled to China this week to discuss potential peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.

Compared to COP28, the negotiations took place in a more structured manner, without the confusion of the Green Zone, the hundreds of pavilions and side events, and with much less civil society participation – which, a priori, could indicate a greater appetite for streamlining and rapid negotiations. But that was not what happened.

Around 6,000 participants from almost 200 countries gathered to address issues such as National Mitigation Plans (NDCs) and Adaptation Plans (NAPs), the Loss and Damage Fund, accelerating climate action through a just transition, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement (Carbon Markets) and the Transparency Framework. Climate finance, in particular the New Quantified Target for Climate Finance (NCQG), will be decided almost entirely at COP29 in Azerbaijan, becoming the “elephant in the room”. 

Despite expectations based on the outcome of the COP28 Global Stocktake on climate finance, SB60 represented a snail’s pace in climate negotiations and a serious omission in relation to the informal commitment to abandon fossil fuels. We returned home with two hands full of nothing and two hands full of everything for Azerbaijan. 

The major agreements of SB60 concerned the length of the texts presented for negotiation, and the structural division between the views of developed and developing countries. 

The current model of climate negotiations, known as the “Global Negotiating Process”, has proven to be ineffective, bureaucratic and dominated by the Global North. Every year, negotiators meet to discuss and make decisions on how best to combat climate change. The working instruments for the negotiations are the negotiating texts, based on written proposals submitted by governments. At the end of a negotiation, the President bangs the gavel to declare that a decision or new treaty has been adopted. The COP is the supreme decision-making body in the climate change process and we are heading towards the 29th.

This inefficiency becomes even more worrying given the consecutive increase, year after year, in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is urgent to rethink the traditional negotiation model and make it more efficient, accessible and transparent to civil society, ensuring a fair and equitable process that legally incorporates the needs of countries on the front line.

463,PT_174.txt,"Artists have given up on “saving” the Amazon

This week, the Amazon experienced its worst fire season in 17 years. The smoke corridor that spread has already affected 10 Brazilian states. Although news about the fires not only in the Amazon Rainforest but also in the Pantanal are highlighted in the media, the concern of those who claim to be defenders of the environment has not been nearly the same as that of the previous government.

In 2021, when everything was the acting president’s fault, Greenpeace Brazil brought together more than 30 artists to release the song “Song for the Amazon”, written by Carlos Rennó and Nando Reis. Several artists who participated in the action also campaigned for Lula in 2022, of course. However, they all remain silent about the increase in fires in Brazil.

Three years ago, Nando Reis himself, when commenting on the project, stated that “The situation in the Amazon is dramatic, serious and represents well the climate catastrophe we are experiencing. And, to make matters worse, we have a president who has no commitment to combating deforestation.” Will Nando’s concerns be the same in 2024, given that he is not making the same demands now?

Also worth mentioning is the speech by Greenpeace’s Amazon Campaign Spokesperson, Carolina Marçal, who stated in September 2021 that “Bolsonaro’s mismanagement is implementing a destructive anti-environmental agenda. We will continue to resist and fight for the Amazon. Art is a powerful form of activism, struggle and resistance, and it is an honour for us to participate in a project like this”, said the expert. Where has all this resistance gone now that Lula is president?

During the last election campaign, one of the main agendas raised by the left was environmental issues and the protection of indigenous peoples, but as with many other things, it was yet another failure.

The number of Yanomami deaths in 2023 was higher than in 2022. Earlier this month, the newspaper “Estadão” reported that Lula’s government would erase data on indigenous deaths. Nothing that seems to worry progressive singers either.

Minister Marina Silva, now forced to appear more often due to the fire crisis, has already blamed climate change, human actions, and El Niño. She even blamed the previous administration for the record deforestation under the PT government, but before supporting and joining the PT there were not so many culprits. The target was just one. As always, according to the left, nothing bad that happens when they are in power is their fault, always someone else’s.

In 2020, Lula questioned where the armed forces were to try to fight the fires in the Pantanal and the Amazon, and stated that the then Minister of the Environment was a citizen without character and without respect for nature. I am still waiting for the moment when you and your current minister will be criticized for what is happening.

With deforestation or fires, dead jaguars or charred alligators, indigenous people being killed or committing suicide, the artists, who so enjoyed appearing in previous years, did not have the courage to take a stand now, confirming that their concern was not with nature but with their pet politician. They quickly gave up on “saving” the Amazon.","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments']",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
464,PT_160.txt,"Too much sunlight and heat reduce mental abilities: here are the results of a study

Science, in several studies published in the literature, has amply demonstrated how excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion or heatstroke, as the body's core temperature rises dangerously.

A new study shows that the scorching sun can have an impact on the brain even when the body temperature remains normal, without excessive temperatures.

The research

Supported by the EU-funded HEAT-SHIELD project, the research team suggests that the real effect of prolonged exposure to sunlight on brain temperature and function has not been fully explored in previous research.

""Acute exposure did not affect performance parameters, while prolonged exposure of the head and neck resulted in a 1°C increase in core temperature and significant changes in controlled cognitive performance and motor activities,"" says the study published in the journal Scientific Reports.

""Importantly, impairments emerged at significantly lower levels of hyperthermia compared to previous experiments,"" it adds. Cognition refers to the mental abilities and processes involved in acquiring and processing information necessary for everyday life. It includes memory, cognition, attention, reasoning, problem-solving and comprehension.

The consequences of hyperthermia

Even short-term hyperthermia can lead to cognitive impairment, negatively affecting attention, memory and information processing.

These results highlight the importance of including the effect of radiative heat from sunlight on the head and neck in future scientific assessments of the impacts of heat stress and of specific head protection to minimise the harmful effects.

What is the impact of heat stress?

According to Professor Lars Nybo, co-author of the study, ""the decrease in cognitive performance was observed at 38.5 degrees, i.e. at a body temperature one degree lower than that demonstrated in previous studies, which represents a substantial difference"".

Co-author Andreas Flouris, associate professor at the University of Thessaly and project partner, stresses the need to mitigate the deterioration in health and performance induced by heat stress, which is intensified by global warming.

The expert stresses that people who work or perform daily activities outdoors should protect their heads from sunlight. ""The ability to maintain concentration and avoid impairment of motor and cognitive performance is certainly important for safety at work and in traffic, as well as for minimizing the risk of error during other daily activities.""

The impact of solar radiation on climate change

The researchers conclude that the harmful effects of solar radiation should be taken into account in future studies examining the current effects of atmospheric or climate change on occupational health.

For the purpose of the study, the researchers tested the mental abilities of eight men, aged between 27 and 41, while they worked at computers with direct exposure to the heat of lamps directed at their heads and backs.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

“The warmer the ocean, the more energy is available for the atmosphere to develop these very deep depressions with significant impacts.” And since “the ocean is very slow,” the consequences last for a long time.

Portugal has “physical conditions for storms to increase in frequency and amplitude.” Storm Ciarán, which reached Europe as a bomb cyclone, is not the first of its kind to hit Portuguese soil, but it is likely that phenomena like this will become more frequent. In addition, the weekend should bring another storm, which already has a name - Domingos.

Geophysicist and former president of the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA) Miguel Miranda warns, in statements to CNN Portugal, about the size of the storms in question. “It is very interesting from a physical point of view but very alarming from a social point of view”, he stresses, noting that in the most affected countries, such as France, winds of 200 km/h were recorded, a highly significant value that is extremely rare on European soil.

Miguel Miranda explains that, mainly due to global warming - which will cause the oceans to warm - it is natural for phenomena like this to occur with greater frequency and intensity. “The warmer the ocean, the more energy is available for the atmosphere to develop these very deep depressions with significant impacts on buildings and people”, adds the geophysicist.

And, although the worst is over, it is expected that several effects will still be felt in the coming days, at least until the weekend. This is because “the ocean is very slow”, which means the consequences will continue over time, even after the system that caused the storm has passed.

“This leads to restrictions on the coast, especially because there is a second ocean storm this weekend that will make life more difficult in coastal communities,” stresses Miguel Miranda.

The expert therefore asks that people strictly follow the recommendations of the IPMA, which has issued a red warning for a large part of the coast, and also leaves an orange warning for at least the entire coast.

“It is important to understand that we are going to have a new high in sea agitation. When an eight-meter-high swell is indicated, this means that 10% of the waves may be over 16 meters. When there is a red warning issued by the IPMA, it must be strictly followed because the dangers that exist are many,” reiterates Miguel Miranda.

Regarding the effects that these bomb cyclones can cause, Miguel Miranda says that “the Portuguese have some experience of tornadoes, systems of another dimension,” but warns of the impacts that wind and rain can have, especially in areas closer to the coast. Just look at what happened in 1941, when IPMA records recorded the first bomb cyclone on national soil.

""When winds reach speeds of this magnitude, they lift objects and destroy trees. The combined action of wind and rain is very impactful - large trees that fall in urban areas are capable of destroying homes and vehicles"", concludes the geophysicist.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
466,PT_175.txt,"Environmental surcharges on airline tickets will become the norm

When you buy a plane ticket, do you choose to pay extra to offset carbon emissions? If the answer is ""no"", you are not alone. Voluntary participation in offsetting schemes may be less than 3% of people.

Instead, Lufthansa will introduce a mandatory ""environmental cost surcharge"" on flights from the EU, the UK, Norway or Switzerland from the beginning of 2025.

This will add up to 72 euros to a long-haul first class ticket. On short- and medium-haul flights, it will be closer to 1 to 7 euros.

The German airline is unlikely to be alone. Mandatory green surcharges are expected to be adopted by traditional airlines in particular.

A number of environmental regulations are to blame, says Lufthansa. She cites EU requirements for jet fuel to include a blend of at least 2% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from next year, as well as changes to emissions trading schemes (ETS) in Europe.

Air France-KLM laid the groundwork in 2022 by imposing a “SAF contribution rate”, charged at a lower level.

Each regulatory change alone is not exorbitant. Indeed, SAF, made from a variety of materials including recycled cooking oil, is expected to cost at least double the long-term historical price of kerosene by 2050, according to a recent report by LEK Consulting.

But assuming Lufthansa’s 2025 fuel bill remains close to the €8.3bn it expects in 2024, a quick calculation suggests that complying with the EU’s 2025 blending rules could cost an extra €17m. The required blending levels will increase again in 2030 and 2035.

Changes to the EU’s ETS scheme and similar programmes elsewhere will be more costly. Polluters currently receive some free allowances, but these are being reduced.

The impact on traditional airlines will be greater, argues Goodbody analyst Dudley Shanley, as they have historically been bigger emitters and tend to have less efficient fleets.

Lufthansa expects to receive free emissions certificates for about 2.8 million tonnes of CO₂ this year, compared with 3.8 million tonnes in 2023, according to its latest annual report.

The reduction could cost €65 million, based on BloombergNEF’s forecast of an average price of €65 per tonne of EU emissions allowance this year. This is expected to rise to €80/t by 2025.

In good times, these costs could be absorbed. Lufthansa is expected to post a net profit of almost €1.8 billion in 2025, according to figures from Visible Alpha. 

However, traditional airlines are fighting a perpetual war to close the huge cost gap with their low-cost competitors.

467,PT_149.txt,"This is not activism: it is radicalism and it is unworthy

In an evolved and democratized society, the ends do not justify the means. In order to defend an idea and fight for a cause, this ceases to be acceptable to society when dialogue is not used in a civilized manner. By resorting to aggression, whatever its modus operandi, one is clearly disrespecting the good practices that activism should implement, with the objective consequence that the struggle and the fight for the idea are not understood, and for that very reason do not have the necessary strength that they should.

In my opinion, the recent events that led to the throwing of green paint at Minister Duarte Cordeiro have a simple reason. Someone is gradually feeding a group, radicalizing the issue of climate change.

With dignity, Duarte Cordeiro continued his work, not dwelling on the controversy, stating that he understands the situation and others in the recent past.

Activism, as we have seen it, with ramifications for the most radical policies, is losing across the board. The debate has given way to the most original ways of showing oneself, but with the sad premise of harming others.

The trend of puncturing the tires of specific brands of cars just because is still very much present in everyone's minds, and in the wallets of some.

This is nothing. This is hitting rock bottom in everything that is civilization and a society that wants to be modern in the debate of ideas.

We will never become evolved if activism in Portugal continues to offer us these sad spectacles that only diminish the power of dialogue in the search for solutions and points of convergence.

The group “Student Climate Strike”, which committed a public crime with its act, which therefore does not require complaint, must realize that it is socially losing the fight, not because of the idea it defends, but because of the way it is defended, and we must all show our indignation towards this group and so many others. No matter how respectable their struggle and conviction are from an ideological point of view, everything starts to look different when they resort to aggression, because it is completely reprehensible.

It is urgent to change the paradigm of thought and action of activist groups. Their notorious “dangerousness” should not be the motto, but unfortunately this is how they show themselves. The right to expression is inalienable and intrinsic to human nature itself, but none of this can be confused with everything we are witnessing. With this episode, which affected Minister Duarte Cordeiro – who was fortunate enough to miss the ink in his eyes – the time has come to tell all activists to change. Be intelligent in the way you do it, be dignified in the fight for your causes and stop violence once and for all.

More than 175,000 people die every year in Europe due to the effects of extreme heatwaves, according to a statement published this Thursday (1) by the European division of the World Health Organization (WHO).

Of the almost 489,000 heat-related deaths recorded annually between 2000 and 2019 in the world, ""the European region accounts for 36%, that is, an average of 176,040 deaths per year"" in this period.

The WHO's European region, which extends to Central Asia, is the one warming the fastest, about twice the global average, says the organization.

In the last 20 years, heat-related mortality has increased by 30% in the region.

""Extreme temperatures aggravate chronic diseases, including cardiovascular, respiratory and cerebrovascular diseases, mental health and diabetes-related conditions,"" explains WHO Europe.

They are also responsible for ""heat stress"", when the human body cannot maintain a temperature between 36 and 37°C, the main cause of climate-related mortality in the region.

According to the WHO, the number of heat victims ""will skyrocket"" in the coming years due to climate change, which has been responsible for the increase in heat waves in recent decades.

""The three hottest years on record in the WHO European region have occurred since 2020, and the ten hottest years since 2007"", explained Kluge.

According to the United Nations organization, it is possible to cope with the heat by adopting simple behaviors, such as keeping the house cool and hydrating regularly.

On July 25, the UN head, António Guterres, made an appeal in the face of the ""epidemic"" of extreme heat and advocated concrete measures to confront this ""invisible killer"".

For the Secretary-General of the United Nations, it is necessary to care for vulnerable people, protect exposed workers and limit the increase in global temperature to 1.5°C.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

470,PT_54.txt,"Dugin: “Ukraine is the First Multipolar Conflict”

In an interview with the international television network RT, Alexander Dugin quickly explained the geopolitical dimension of the Ukrainian conflict and the foundations of the multipolar world that is rising against the imperialist universalism of the West.

The conflict in Ukraine is the world’s “first multipolar war,” in which Russia fights for the right of each civilization to choose its own path while the West wants to maintain its hegemonic totalitarian globalism, Aleksandr Dugin told RT in an exclusive interview on Friday.

Multipolarity is not “against the West as such,” Dugin said, but “against the West’s claim to be the model, to be the unique example” of history and human understanding. Today’s Russophobia and hatred of Russia, he argued, are a relic of Cold War thinking and the “bipolar understanding of the architecture of international relations.”

When the Soviet Union self-destructed in December 1991, it left the “Western global liberal civilization” in control of the world, Dugin noted. This hegemon now refuses to accept a future in which it would be “not one of two, but one of [a few] poles,” put in its rightful place as “just a part, not the whole, of humanity.” Dugin described the West as “pure totalitarian liberalism,” which pretends to have absolute truth and seeks to impose it on everyone. “There is racism inherent in Western liberalism,” the philosopher told RT’s Donald Courter, because it “identifies Western historical, political, cultural experience [as] universal.” “There is no universal in multipolarity,” Dugin insisted, explaining that each civilization can and should develop its own values. Russia specifically needs to overcome centuries of Western ideological dominance, he said, and create something “new, fresh, creative” that would nevertheless remain “in direct refutation of Western liberal hegemony, against the open society, against individualism, against liberal democracy.” He rejected the “dogmatic” attitudes of Marxism, fascism or liberalism toward politics and economics, saying Russia should strive for a “holistic” approach, in which the spiritual would be more important than the material. Obsession with material goods ends up enslaving people, Dugin told RT. Dugin lamented the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 as a “suicide” perpetrated by power-hungry bureaucrats in Moscow. He echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s description of the event as a “geopolitical disaster” and described it as a great victory for “Sea Power.” While the USSR was the polar opposite of the Russian Empire in ideological terms, he explained, in geopolitical terms the two were one and the same, the strongest power in what the English geographer Harold Mackinder described as the global Heartland. 

While some Western observers have called Dugin “Putin’s brain,” the 60-year-old philosopher and author has no official ties to the Kremlin. He is an outspoken supporter of the current military operation in Ukraine — whose independence he sees as a Western imperial project against Russian sovereignty. 

Dugin’s daughter, Daria, just 29, was murdered in August by a car bomb set by Ukrainian agents. Although Kiev officially denied it, US intelligence officials later said they believed someone in the Ukrainian government was involved and responsible.","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

In recent days, information has appeared on the network about attacks by Ukrainian Armed Forces UAVs on:

▪️the Voronezh-DM long-range radar near Armavir.

▪️the Voronezh family long-range radar in the Orenburg region.

In addition, Portuguese-made Tekever AR3 UAVs were not spared for the attacks.

These stations are an element of Russia's nuclear security shield. We note that, in accordance with Russia's National Security Strategy, in achieving the country's defense goals, special attention is paid to solving tasks, among which ""maintaining a sufficient level of nuclear deterrence potential"" stands out.

The attacks on these radars are a serious decision. They solve several tasks:

▪️Weakening of Russia's nuclear security

▪️Repeated testing of Russia's patience

▪️Russia's provocation to use tactical nuclear weapons

▪️In the absence of a firm reaction from Russia, creating conditions for further weakening of our strategic defense in the event of a direct conflict with NATO.

After these attacks on our long-range radars, a surprised expression was made by The Washington Post: ""The US is concerned about Ukrainian drone attacks on long-range radars in Russia. In the newspaper's opinion, this could disrupt 'strategic stability'.""

This ""concern"" of the Americans is completely understandable. For, according to the open Supreme Decree “On the Fundamentals of the State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence”, the conditions that determine the possibility of using nuclear weapons by the Russian Federation include “the enemy’s influence on critical objects of state or military importance of the Russian Federation, the deactivation of which will lead to the failure of retaliatory actions by nuclear forces”.

Today, all the legal grounds for the use of nuclear weapons by Russia on the territory of Ukraine have been established. And nowhere does it say that these weapons should be designated as “tactical”.

However, given the eternal delay in implementing retaliatory measures or their media-driven nature, we are unlikely to see such actions in the near future.

And so far, the situation is still moving in such a way that no one thinks about the moral aspects of such actions or about opening the “Overton Window” or “Pandora’s Box” “when the very existence of the state is threatened”.",['URW: Amplifying war-related fears'],['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Russia is not outright rejecting participation in a future peace conference with Ukraine, but it wants to first understand the framework of the meeting suggested this week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The Kremlin responded on Tuesday to the proposal put forward the day before by Zelensky that Russia should be present at a second peace summit that could probably be scheduled for November.

“The first peace summit was not a peace summit at all, so perhaps we need to first understand what he means,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday in an interview with the military channel Zvezda, quoted by the Moscow Times.

Peskov was referring to the conference organized by Switzerland in June, in the Alps, to which no Russian leader was invited. At the time, this was a demand from Zelensky, who refused to sit at the table with representatives of the power that occupies part of Ukrainian territory.

Moscow criticised the lack of an invitation and several countries decided not to attend the conference, including China, Russia’s main diplomatic ally. Other nations from the Global South that were present ended up not signing the final communiqué, dealing a blow to the ambitions of Kiev and its Western partners to provide strong global support for Zelensky’s peace plan. 

Despite the lack of an invitation to Russia at the summit in Switzerland, the possibility of Russian representatives participating in future meetings was never ruled out. 

Still, it is difficult to see what could bring the two countries’ positions closer together in potential talks. Ukraine is demanding an immediate military withdrawal by Russia from the occupied territories, while Moscow wants recognition of the annexations of the four provinces it partially occupies.

The environmental group, in a note sent to newsrooms, indicated that the sentence was read this Monday morning, in “the same month in which the temperature broke the world record twice in a row”. seven months ago, while governments and fossil fuel companies were meeting at COP28, to which they flew en masse by private jet for yet another round of false promises, Climáximo supporters entered the Cascais airfield, painted a private jet with red paint and blocked it with their bodies”,

The six activists were tried for, in December 2023, blocking a private jet at the Cascais airfield, to denounce the “superfluous and luxury flights of the super-rich, and the use of these weapons of mass destruction, whose emissions are killing people all over the world”.

Climáximo recalls that, “seven months ago, while governments and fossil fuel companies were meeting at COP28, to which they flew en masse by private jet for yet another round of false promises, Climáximo supporters entered the Cascais airfield, painted a private jet with red paint and blocked it with their bodies”.

The group stresses that this sentence will not intimidate its supporters, “nor will it stop the fight”.

One of the convicted activists, quoted in the group’s statement, lamented that “today, despite the court’s admission of the gravity of the climate crisis and the impact of disruptive protests, the people who took action to stop the destruction have been convicted, while the real culprits remain unpunished”.

This week, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmitry Kuleba traveled to New Delhi to seek support from the world's most populous nation, seeking to deepen ties with countries in the Global South as Ukraine faces a critical moment on the battlefield.

In an interview with the Financial Times, the foreign minister urged the Indian government to support Kiev, saying that close ties between India and Russia are based on a ""Soviet legacy"".

The foreign minister's visit is the first by a senior Ukrainian official to India since the Russian operation in Ukraine began.

""Cooperation between India and Russia is largely based on the Soviet legacy. But this is not a legacy that will last for centuries; it is a legacy that is evaporating,"" he said.

Kuleba also made a provocative connection by linking the friendship between Moscow and Beijing with what China supposedly means to India today.

“The Sino-Russian relationship should be of special concern to India, in light of its national security prerogatives.”

Going further in his arguments to convince New Delhi, Kuleba cited that when the conflict ends, Ukraine “will probably become the largest construction site in the world and Indian companies are welcome to participate in the recovery.”

Kiev is now seeking to “restore trade” with India, the minister said, by resuming exports of agricultural products such as sunflower oil and buying more Indian products itself: “We are interested in importing some of the heavy machinery items that India produces,” he added.

Ukraine has struggled to win the favor of India and many other countries in the Global South. These states have mostly avoided taking sides in a conflict that they consider to be “the business of rich nations” and whose economic price they have paid in trade disruptions and higher costs, the media reports. Despite Kuleba’s statements that ties between Moscow and New Delhi are “evaporating”, Russia remains India’s largest arms supplier. The Indian state has also become one of the main buyers of Russian crude oil following the Russian operation in Ukraine, and India shares with Moscow (along with China and Brazil) the original founding of the BRICS. The media recall that Kuleba previously claimed that every barrel of Russian crude oil purchased by India contained “a good portion of Ukrainian blood”. However, Kiev has sought to soften relations with New Delhi as it tries to win over more countries to its cause, writes the Financial Times.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The end of the confrontation between Moscow and Kiev must be accompanied by the elimination of the threat posed by the West to Russia's security, the foreign minister said during an open debate of the Security Council convened by his delegation, which is chairing the body this month.

Lavrov insisted that both his country and the West need mutual guarantees and agreements, in a clear allusion to the need to reach an agreement for the security of both.

At the same time, he considered it necessary to take into account the new geostrategic realities on the Eurasian continent, where a new, truly equal and indivisible continental security architecture is being formed.

In this context, he added, Europe risks falling behind in this objectively historic process.

“We are ready to seek a balance of interests,” he added.

The global and regional balance of power must also be restored, along with the redress of injustices in the global economy, the senior diplomat added.

The Russian Foreign Minister rejected the use of these coercive measures in a multipolar world that, in his opinion, should not have any monopoly on financial or monetary regulation, trade or technology.

Regarding US policy, the head of Russian diplomacy warned that Washington is convinced that a new global war will not affect the United States, but rather its European allies.

“If this analysis forms the basis of the strategy of the (Joe) Biden administration, it is a very dangerous mistake, and the Europeans should understand that they have been assigned a suicidal role,” he added before members of the highest body for peace on the planet.

At the same time, he demanded that more attention be paid to national minorities in resolving the conflict on Ukrainian territory.

“We call on all those who show a sincere interest in overcoming the crisis in Ukraine to consider the fundamental issue of the rights of national minorities in any of their proposals. Everyone, without exception,” the high representative insisted.

The study, published on Saturday in the scientific journal Scientific Reports, from the Nature group, analyzed “an unprecedented set of data” collected over the course of a year in caves in various parts of the world, from subarctic to tropical regions, including, in Portugal, caves in the center of the country, in the Algarve and in the Azores.

Over the course of a year, the temperature in caves and on the surface was measured every two hours, totaling more than 100,000 measurements, which “show that the temperature in the caves corresponds to the average annual surface temperature for each location,” said Ana Sofia Reboleira, Professor at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon and researcher at the Center for Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Changes, to the Lusa news agency.

According to the biologist, “the caves responded with three different patterns”: one in which the variation in the outside temperature is reflected in the cave with a small delay, another in which the surface temperatures are quickly reflected inside, and a third in which they work as a mirror image, the lower the surface temperature, the higher the temperature inside the cave and vice versa.

More surprising was the discovery of the “existence of daily thermal cycles in some caves”, considered by the researcher “particularly interesting because in ecosystems with a total absence of light, organisms lack circadian rhythms, that is, biological rhythms marked by the natural cadence of day and night controlled by sunlight on the surface”.

This discovery “shows that these daily thermal cycles can potentially control the biological rhythms of subterranean organisms”, a hypothesis that is being put forward for the first time in the history of Biology.

“These ecosystems are inhabited by unique species that play a very important role in what scientists call ecosystem services” since, she explained, “these animals ensure the recycling of nutrients at depth, of some contaminants that reach them, that control bacterial growth and other types of problems that can affect us”.

Since these are organisms adapted to low amplitudes and reduced thermal variability, the increase in temperatures of several degrees, due to climate change, “will certainly affect these organisms responsible for ensuring the good ecological state of these underground bodies of water”, which represent 97% of the total freshwater resources available for immediate human consumption.

Among the caves studied in the study, the scientist highlights the case of one in Loulé that recorded the highest surface temperature, with more than 39 degrees, and another in the Azores, with the largest thermal amplitude, with a variation of 8.8, explained by the fact that it is a volcanic cave.

The impact of climate change, combined with the fact that underground ecosystems “are constantly neglected in political and public agendas”, have led researchers to now move forward with laboratory studies “on the effects of rising temperatures on these organisms” with the aim of estimating the maximum temperatures that they can withstand.

In addition to the coordinator, the study now published also included the participation of Maria João Medina, a master’s student whose dissertation includes the study, and Paulo Borges from the University of the Azores.

A family doctor points out measures that can be taken to minimize the effects of extreme temperatures, but draws attention to the lack of public policies for adapting to climate change.

Brazil began the last week of winter facing an extreme heat wave. An atmospheric blockage has prevented the arrival of the cold fronts that are common for the season and has promised temperatures above 40ºC in several regions, especially in the Center-West and Southeast.

The effects of this temperature spike can go beyond mere discomfort. It is possible to develop hyperthermia and heatstroke, which can even cause death – especially among more vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly.

Is it possible to die from heat? Doctor explains

In an interview with Natuza Nery, family and community doctor Mayara Floss explains what measures can be taken to minimize the effects of extreme temperatures, and also draws attention to the lack of public policies for adapting to climate change.

""For example, shanty towns, regions with few trees – where there are vast monocultures... These demographic factors put these populations at risk"", she says.

To mitigate the effects of heat on a daily basis, Mayara mentions measures such as: carrying a lighter change of clothes to use on public transport during rush hour; placing a bottle of ice-cold water to cool areas of the body, such as the armpits; if possible, prioritise working hours early in the morning, avoiding times of greatest temperature rises; keeping the house more ventilated at night and more closed during the day.","['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
479,PT_188.txt,"Environmental Crisis in the Pantanal: Drought and deforestation devastate the Biome

The Pantanal, one of the largest wetlands on the planet, is facing an unprecedented environmental crisis.

The combination of deforestation and prolonged droughts has led to an alarming reduction in the water surface, affecting not only local biodiversity, but also the communities that depend on these natural resources.

A recent study by the MapBiomas platform highlights that, in the current century, almost every year there has been a decrease in the water surface in Brazil, with the Pantanal and Cerrado being the most affected biomes.

Experts warn of the risk of a severe drought and a possible water collapse, a direct consequence of the neglect of springs and riverside forests, essential for the percolation of rain into the earth and for maintaining the flow of rivers.

Deforestation in the Amazon, which affects rainfall through evapotranspiration, also contributes significantly to drought in the Pantanal, creating ideal conditions for the spread of devastating fires. These fires, in turn, further compromise soil structure and reduce the amount of water available in the water table. The situation is aggravated by the fact that the Pantanal has lost 29% of its surface water, with 57% of its territory having been burned at least once in the last 36 years. This loss not only signals a decline in the health of the biome, but also reflects the profound climate changes that are occurring at a global level. The receding water level of the Paraguay River, which is registering levels close to historical lows, is another indicator of the severity of the situation. The impact of these changes goes beyond environmental degradation, also affecting the economy and society, with damage that overlaps and amplifies the challenges faced by the region. It is imperative that measures are taken to mitigate these effects and protect the Pantanal for future generations. Raising awareness of the importance of ecosystem services provided by biomes such as the Pantanal and the Amazon is a crucial step in this process.

The preservation of these ecosystems is not just a matter of nature conservation, but a necessity for the sustainability of our own way of life.

His home is in a village in Mato Grosso, in the heart of the Brazilian Amazon. But for some time now, his stage has been the whole world. Wherever he is invited, he goes, because indigenous leader Raoni Metuktire, now 93 years old, has dedicated his life not only to defending the Amazon rainforest, but also to warning that, in the face of the climate disasters of our time, “nothing can be saved alone”.

This led him to walk the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival a year ago, and to go to Belém last March, where French President Emmanuel Macron, accompanied by his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, presented him with the Legion of Honour insignia.

And now he has been given a new opportunity by Pope Francis, who wanted him to be among the protagonists of the international summit “From climate crisis to climate resistance”, which took place in the Casina Pio VI, in Vatican City.

Recalling the meeting he had with the Pontiff, Raoni told ANSA: “I asked him to make clear to the Catholics who follow him in Brazil what the Church’s orientation is on environmental issues, because sometimes they seem not to have understood the message”.

Speaking in the language of the Mebengokre indigenous people, Raoni stressed that “a void is gradually being created around our lands in the Amazon and there is no longer anything truly protected”.

“We live almost on islands and, as if that were not enough, there are people who are not satisfied, who want to attack even the reserves where we live, putting our survival at risk”.

“What is happening?” he asked, adding that he is “worried because people living in the developed world do not understand that this is a problem for us, but also for them”.

According to the chief, now in Brazil, “we are facing a ‘monster’ with two heads: on the one hand, the serious drought phenomena in the north of the country, where fires are multiplying, and, on the other, the tragedy of floods, such as the one that recently occurred in the south of Brazil”.

Focusing on indigenous lands, Raoni recalled that, “when Lula became president, he promised me that he would clearly demarcate them”.

“I am still waiting for that to happen. Of course, we have better relations with his government than when Jair Bolsonaro was in power. But right now for us there are many words, but few actions”.

Addressing the large group of experts who listened to him and who at the end of the presentation gave him a standing ovation at the summit, Raoni argued that “the developed world seems convinced of the urgency of the fight against climate change”.

“But now we need to decide to immediately finance the tools to start the necessary projects, before it is too late. It is useless to remember that, normally, we do not use money in our reserves. Money, in large quantities, is used in the developed world”, he said, guaranteeing that “the time has come to use [the money] to save life on the planet”.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other']",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Renowned French philosopher Nostradamus’s prophecies for 2024 have been revealed, bringing with them worrying news about what the coming year could hold for the world. Nostradamus, whose accurate predictions have included historical events such as the rise of Adolf Hitler and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, released his visions of the future in the book Les Prophéties more than 450 years ago. His words have been considered a ‘warning’ of what is to come.

One of the most alarming predictions suggests that King Charles could face difficult times in 2024. Although the text does not mention a specific king, it is speculated that it refers to the current leader of the British monarchy. Analysts have interpreted Nostradamus’ words as a possible abdication scenario due to persistent attacks on the king and his second wife, Queen Camilla.

In another intriguing prediction, Nostradamus foresees an imminent naval conflict, indicating that a “red enemy” will turn pale with fear, putting the ocean in a state of apprehension. Many believe that this red enemy is communist China, suggesting a possible confrontation in the Indian Ocean.

In addition, Nostradamus warns of disasters related to climate change. He predicts that the Earth will become increasingly arid, resulting in floods and rising sea levels as ice caps melt. The mystic warns of a possible great famine due to pestilential waves, indicating the possibility of a tsunami that would threaten crops.

The Future of the Catholic Church: Election of a New Pope

Nostradamus also makes a prediction related to the Catholic Church, suggesting that Pope Francis could die in 2024. Turning 88 in December, the Pope could be replaced by an “elderly Roman” upon his death. Although there are several potential candidates, the choice will be made between cardinals under the age of 80.

Nostradamus’s dire predictions for 2024 have the world on alert, prompting reflections on the uncertain future that awaits us.

482,PT_162.txt,"Plankton observation: why is it so important to predict the next mass extinction?

What if we carefully observed the movements of plankton in the oceans? No, this is not a far-fetched suggestion to occupy your afternoons, but rather a very serious study with surprising results carried out by a team of researchers from the Universities of Bristol (United Kingdom), Harvard, Texas (USA) and Victoria (Australia), published in the journal Nature.

What happened 53 million years ago?

These scientists discovered that, around 50 million years ago (more precisely between 53 and 49 million years ago), almost all marine plankton, that is, all aquatic plants and animals that drift with the currents, moved to the higher latitudes, between the Antarctic Circle and the South Pole.

This surprising change preceded by several million years a mass extinction of marine species in the ocean. What is even more worrying is that during this Eocene period, between 53 and 49 million years ago, there was a “climatic optimum”, that is, a period of “persistently high” global temperatures that is curiously reminiscent of today.

Climatologists are inevitably very concerned, since this “Eocene climatic optimum” is close to the most pessimistic scenarios of global warming currently being studied. It is clear that plankton must be subject to close scrutiny at this time, because the slightest change could mean the same disastrous scenario of the Eocene, with a mass extinction of species.

An “early warning system”

Of course, the authors of the study explain that the past is never a reflection of the future and that this is only a correlation between the movement of plankton and the disappearance of species, and is in no way a causal relationship. However, they believe that plankton could act as a warning before a supposed wave of extinction of larger marine species.

Study co-author Dr Adam Woodhouse (Bristol) described the results as “exciting”, however, adding that observing plankton could provide an “early warning system” for predicting the extinction of life in the oceans. Indeed, by applying their computer model to the archives, his team revealed that, since the disappearance of the dinosaurs, changes in plankton have often preceded the extinction of certain organisms.",['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The majestic Perito Moreno Glacier, one of the icons of the Argentine Patagonia landscape, is sending a warning signal to the world. Located in Los Glaciares National Park, this ice giant, with its impressive area of ​​250 square kilometres and an average height of 60 metres, is more than a natural wonder. It is a testament to the power of nature and, more recently, to the urgent need for collective action in favour of the environment.

Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981, the glacier is part of the third largest body of continental ice on the planet, behind only Antarctica and Greenland. In other words, its grandeur and beauty serve as an unmistakable reminder of the indomitable nature. However, researchers at the Argentine Institute of Nivology and Glaciology have observed with growing concern the signs of imminent change.

A group of experts has been studying the effects of climate change on the Perito Moreno Glacier. According to the results, since 2021, the glacier has retreated by around 700 meters on the northern shore of the Los Témpanos Channel. This retreat surprised the scientific community, since until then, the glacier had gone against regional trends by showing stability, with little evidence of melting or significant retreat.

Influence of climate change

The explanation for this retreat lies in the climate changes that have been occurring on the planet. The increase in temperatures has resulted in accelerated melting of the glacier and the detachment of blocks of ice. In addition, the lack of precipitation that results in the accumulation of snow also plays a crucial role in this scenario, among other issues.

This scenario not only affects the delicate balance of the region's ecosystem, but also directly impacts tourism in the area. The hiking experience to the Perito Moreno Glacier has already been affected, with the trekking route having to be readjusted due to changes in the glacier's geography.

It is in this context that Patagonia Experience Travel, an agency specializing in trips to the Patagonian region, highlights the importance of embracing sustainable tourism as a way of uniting human beings in favor of mitigating the effects of climate change.

The agency's CEO, Jefferson Gonzalez, who has served as an ambassador for the Patagonian region in Brazil for 13 years, stresses that it is essential to raise awareness of the consequences of climate change so that this natural wonder can be preserved for future generations.

Mário Machado, a well-known former leader of neo-Nazi skinheads in Portugal, sentenced to prison terms for several crimes, said on social media that if Poland invokes NATO article 5 and his three sons of military age are called up for “war”, all communists in Portugal will become legitimate targets. This is quite a contradiction, since the Portuguese communist party, unlike the parliamentary majority, is against Portugal’s integration into NATO, and United Russia, Vladimir Putin’s party, has an absolute majority in the Federal Duma (325 seats). It is a nationalist, conservative, populist party, and is affiliated with the Centrist Democratic International, an adversary of the Russian communist party, which has only 57 seats.

André Ventura's supporter based his argument on the news that Russia had hit Poland with 2 missiles, a news that has since been denied by Poland, which ultimately attributes the “unfortunate accident” to Ukraine.

Although Russia has not been communist for many years, and despite the fact that there are several Chega members who are also on Putin's side, as the Chega municipal deputy in Cascais, Maria Vieira, can attest, Mário Machado turns the targets onto the Portuguese communists:

Russia hit Poland with 2 missiles, killing 2 people. If Poland invokes NATO's Article 5, and 3 of my military-age sons are called up, all communists in Portugal will become legitimate targets.

The Belgorod region shares a 540-kilometer border with Ukraine and is the Russian Federation entity most affected by Ukrainian military actions.

According to data from local authorities provided last April, more than 120 civilians had been killed in the region as a result of Ukrainian attacks since the beginning of the war.

In recent weeks, attacks have intensified against this Russian region, which borders the Ukrainian provinces of Sumy, Kharkiv and Lugansk from west to south, the latter of which was annexed by Russia in September 2022.

The Russian military offensive on Ukrainian territory, launched on 24 February 2022, has plunged Europe into what is considered the most serious security crisis since the Second World War (1939-1945).

Ukraine has been relying on financial and weapons aid from its Western allies, who have also imposed sanctions on key sectors of the Russian economy in an attempt to reduce Moscow's ability to finance the war effort.

The past few months have been marked by large-scale Russian airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, while Kiev's forces have targeted targets in Russian territory close to the border and on the Crimean peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014.

For the Russian president's spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Ukraine must take into account the drastic changes in the country's borders since the start of the special military operation in the peace negotiations. Increasingly abandoned by the West, the country has accumulated significant losses in recent months.

Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said in an interview with CBS News that returning to the 1991 borders was no longer a prerequisite for negotiations with Russia. However, the Ukrainian still insisted that Kiev must regain the territory lost to Moscow by 2022.

That year, four former Ukrainian regions — Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye — voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in a public referendum. The population followed suit in the Crimean peninsula, which did the same in 2014.

After the 2022 referendums, Zelensky banned all talks with the current Russian leadership, focusing on a formula for ending the conflict that requires a complete withdrawal of Moscow's forces from all previously mentioned territories.

Although Russia claims to be open to talks with Kiev, the country has rejected Zelensky's idea as ""detached from reality"".

Regarding Zelensky's statements, Peskov told Sputnik on Saturday (30) that ""the geopolitical reality has changed dramatically since the beginning of the special military operation. The borders of both Ukraine and the Russian Federation have changed.""

The spokesman also commented that Russia has already incorporated the four former Ukrainian regions, stressing that this reality ""cannot be ignored"".

Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry official Maria Zakharova said Zelensky’s change of position was due to “nervousness.” “He has an election coming up. Or is there no election?” she asked. The Ukrainian president has previously indicated he has no plans to authorise a vote, citing martial law, which has drawn criticism both at home and abroad. Zelensky’s remarks followed a statement by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba, who said Kiev could engage with Moscow at some point after a summit in Switzerland later this year that is widely expected to revolve around Zelensky’s peace formula.

Airbus on Monday revised upwards its forecast for demand for aircraft over the next 20 years, Reuters reported. According to the agency, which cites an annual report on industry trends, the global fleet could reach 48,230 planes in the next 20 years, or more than double.

According to the document, the world's largest planemaker forecast the delivery of 42,430 new planes over the next 20 years, including 41,490 passenger planes, an increase of 4% in both figures since the previous study.

The report comes as the planemaker's long-range, single-aisle A321XLR is expected to gain certification in the coming days.

Boeing, which has been embroiled in controversy in recent times, is developing a long-range version of its 737 MAX.

Patients in the psychiatric ward of Mariupol Hospital No. 7 were likely used as vulnerable “guinea pigs” in experiments that would not have been permitted in the countries where these pharmaceutical companies are located, William Jones, a former White House correspondent for Executive Intelligence Review and a nonresident fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, Renmin University of China, told Sputnik.

“In general, it has been the practice to use some of the developing countries that do not have such strict controls for these types of experiments,” Jones noted, alluding to Ukraine.

After the 2014 Maidan coup in Kiev, the country “effectively became a ‘guinea pig’ for whatever experiments the Western elite forces had in store for them, as we see most dramatically in the way the ‘nation’ of Ukraine is being reduced to nothing by NATO’s proxy war against Russia,” the expert said.

He also addressed the issue of “the extensive network of biological laboratories that have been established in Ukraine over the past 20 years, largely with the help, and no doubt at the request, of the United States,” something Jones recalled having been repeatedly pointed out by Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, head of the Russian Defense Ministry’s Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces. 

“Given the current situation in Ukraine, with the growing understanding that Ukraine — or NATO — cannot ‘win’ this conflict using conventional weapons, as well as NATO’s determination not to accept a peaceful resolution unless Russia is defeated, this could very well lead to NATO using some form of biological warfare to ‘level the playing field,’” Jones warned. 

In the spring of 2022, Russia’s Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces brought to light the alarming extent of U.S. biomilitary activities taking place in several locations in Ukraine. These investigations revealed collaboration between Washington and Kiev in the research and treatment of several highly dangerous pathogens. Several of these findings were subsequently independently corroborated.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Russia's soft power in combating US hegemony in Latin America ""is successful,"" historian and international analyst Daniel Trujillo Sanz told Sputnik when commenting on Russian President Vladimir Putin's annual message.

In his annual message to the Federal Assembly on Thursday (29), Putin advocated strengthening relations with Latin American countries. He added that it is important for Russia to seek new points of convergence and deepen the full range of partnerships, especially with its Arab and South American counterparts.

Regarding the president's speech, Sanz said that ""we saw a sober, concise and direct speech from President Putin, as always, clearly structured."" The analyst drew a parallel between the words of the Russian head of state and those of Western leaders, ""whose criteria seem to change every day.""

""We can refer to [French President Emmanuel] Macron as an example. One day he leads a rebellion against NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization], the next day he proposes sending French forces to Ukraine and practically triggering a war,"" he emphasized. 

The analyst also gave other examples of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with the entry of Finland and Sweden into NATO. In addition, he drew attention to Germany's attitude ""towards the terrible and very serious sabotage it suffered in its national interest with the explosion of Nord Stream"". 

Still on Latin America, Sanz added that it is necessary to admit that the United States ""continues to have hegemony or at least primacy in this regard"". 

""Culture, music, lifestyle and clothing have clearly established themselves during the era of globalisation, and in this respect Russia must overcome decades of influence, especially in Latin America and other parts of the world. I consider it absolutely necessary for Russia to start taking part in this fight, despite the difficulties it will face.""

On 29 February, Vladimir Putin delivered his annual message to the Federal Assembly. The president took stock of the country's situation and outlined the main lines of action in domestic and foreign policy for the next six years.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United States are focused on an escalation of the crisis in Ukraine, which creates strategic risks and could even lead to a confrontation between nuclear powers.

""The United States and NATO do not show the slightest interest in a fair resolution of the current conflict. They are clearly not willing to consider Russian concerns and to work seriously on eliminating fundamental contradictions,"" said a statement from the ministry.

The special military operation will complete two years in February, amid constant Ukrainian defeats and the insistence of Vladimir Zelensky's regime on continuing the fighting at any cost to the country.

""The West is focused on the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis, which now represents the main strategic risks, as such a course could lead to a direct confrontation between nuclear powers with catastrophic consequences,"" the ministry added.

Moscow added that ""the destructive policy of the United States has led to a deep deterioration of Russian-American relations and a radical change in the security situation."" In addition, Russia has repeatedly indicated its readiness to negotiate, while Kiev refuses to engage in dialogue.

Ten years after the downing of MH17, which was flying over Ukraine, the families of the victims have little hope of seeing those responsible arrested.

Hundreds of relatives of the 298 victims attended a tribute on Wednesday (17) near Amsterdam-Schiphol airport, from where the plane took off on 17 July 2014 bound for Kuala Lumpur.

Hours later, the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was hit by a Russian-made missile in an area of ​​Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists. All people on board died.

During the ceremony, the names of all the victims were read out loud, most from the Netherlands (196), but also many from Malaysia (43) and Australia (38).

Dutch courts sentenced three men to life in prison in 2022 for their role in the disaster, including two Russians, but Moscow has refused to extradite any suspects. International investigators suspended their work last year after concluding there was insufficient evidence to pursue the suspects involved. ""I don't think those responsible will serve their sentences,"" Evert van Zijtveld, who lost his 19-year-old daughter Frédérique, 18-year-old son Robert-Jan and his in-laws, told AFP. Dutch television broadcast the ceremony live and the national flag was flown at half-mast in many towns across the country. The Australian government, in a ceremony in parliament with relatives of the victims, said it would not back down ""from its commitment to holding Russia accountable"". ""I recommit myself to our collective pursuit of truth, justice and accountability for the atrocities committed on 17 July 2014,"" said Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong.

- ""Hard to believe"" -

The plane crashed in the early stages of the conflict between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country, during which Moscow took control of the Crimean peninsula.

In November 2022, a Dutch court found Russians Igor Guirkin and Sergei Dubinski and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko ""guilty"" of intentional homicide and sentenced them to life in prison.

The magistrates found that they were responsible for transporting the missile that brought down the plane from a base in Russia to the launch site, although they were not charged with firing it.

The three men refused to take part in the Dutch trial, which convicted them in absentia, and denied any responsibility. A fourth suspect, Russian Oleg Pulatov, was acquitted.

International investigators concluded that there was ""strong evidence"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the supply of the missile that brought down the plane.

Moscow denies any involvement and has strongly rejected the court's 2022 verdict as ""political"" and ""scandalous"".

The European Union urged Moscow on Tuesday to ""accept its responsibility for this tragedy and to cooperate fully in the service of justice"".

The evidence presented during the trial ""clearly shows that the BUK surface-to-air missile system used to shoot down Flight MH17 belonged without a doubt to the armed forces of the Russian Federation"", EU foreign minister Josep Borrell said.

Moscow has refused to extradite the suspects, saying it would be against its laws.

""The invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of the war make it really hard to believe that one of them will be arrested soon,"" Evert van Zijtveld said.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Granada Romero Ruiz, 86, died after being hospitalized for 9 days in a hospital in Seville, Spain, after being bitten by a mosquito and contracting the “paralytic” West Nile virus. The elderly woman’s son, Antonio Pineda, said she was in perfect health before being bitten.

“She had no underlying health problems, she was healthy, active and leading a normal life,” he told local media. Tragically, this is not the first time the virus has affected the lives of the Granada family. The woman’s husband contracted the virus in 2016.

In a statement on X published alongside a photo of Granada holding a beer, the city council of La Puebla del Rio, a municipality in Seville, said it regretted the incident and was working “tirelessly to ensure that all administrations do everything possible, without holding back, against the virus and that there is a permanent service against mosquitoes”.

New outbreaks of the “paralysing” West Nile virus

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says there have been new outbreaks in parts of Greece and Italy and is warning against the deadly virus.

“Europe is already seeing how climate change is creating more favourable conditions for invasive mosquitoes to spread to previously unaffected areas and infect more people,” said ECDC director Andrea Ammon.

Who is at risk?

According to health professionals, people over 50 and those with conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure or cancer are at greater risk of contracting the disease.

What mosquito transmits the “paralysing” West Nile virus?

The Asian tiger mosquito — known to transmit several diseases, including West Nile — has been detected in the UK on several occasions since 2016.

The mosquito, known for the black and white stripes along its body and legs, can transmit several tropical diseases, including dengue, Zika and chikungunya.

What are the symptoms of West Nile disease?

The symptoms of the disease are similar to those of the flu (such as fever, body aches and headache), rash and feeling unwell.

Others may experience muscle weakness, confusion, loss of vision, numbness, stiff neck, diarrhoea and seizures.

What is the treatment for West Nile disease?

Treatment usually involves rest, hydration and over-the-counter painkillers.

Severe cases need to be treated in hospitals, as they can cause meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord) and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), warn the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Heat is expected to make human life impossible in at least five regions of the Earth in the next 50 years, including Brazil, according to a study by the US Space Agency (NASA).

The research found that rising temperatures combined with high levels of air humidity can cause thermal effects to which the human body would not be able to adapt.

The emission of greenhouse gases directly impacts nature, with increasingly accelerated and severe climate change across the planet. Rising temperatures make unseasonal heat waves more frequent and winters less intense or shorter than usual.

According to NASA, the body's cooling process occurs through perspiration, that is, sweat. Rising temperatures combined with humidity increase the sensation of heat and prevent sweat from evaporating, which keeps the body hot – and can be fatal.

The study indicates that temperatures above 37ºC – a mark exceeded in many regions of Brazil during the summer – with humidity levels equal to or greater than 70% can cause premature death after up to six hours of exposure.

The body can still sweat at temperatures of 45ºC and humidity levels of up to 20%. However, the research projects that with the thermometer at the same level and a humidity level above 40%, the thermal sensation can exceed 71ºC and be lethal.

Although the combination of these factors is considered rare, since hot days are characterized by drier air, the study found that the phenomenon has been observed in regions of the Persian Gulf and Pakistan since 2005.

In this scenario, NASA considered the trend of increasing temperatures in the coming decades, with climate change driven by the emission of greenhouse gases, and concluded that human life may be threatened in areas of the center-west, north, northeast and southeast of Brazil.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the most important events of the long period of civil war in Ukraine that preceded the Russian invasion of 2022, the downing of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 in the east of the country, completes ten years marked by impunity this Wednesday (17).

""Who fired the missile? Who gave the order?"", asked in a video message the president of the foundation for the families of the 298 victims of the incident, the Dutchman Piet Ploeg. He lost his brother, sister-in-law and nephew on the flight.

An international investigation, which was able to collect the wreckage of the plane, reached several consensuses. First, that the anti-aircraft missile had been fired from a Soviet-made Buk system. Second, more controversial, that the weapon had been launched from territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine.

In 2022, a Dutch court, the country of birth of 193 of those killed while flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur (capital of Malaysia), sentenced three people to life imprisonment ""in absentia"" for more general involvement in the downing: Russians Igor Girkin and Serguei Dubinski, as well as Ukrainian Leonid Khartchenko. All of them operated with separatist forces in the region and, according to the European country's justice system, had worked to bring, deploy and then return the Buk to a Russian base in the region across the border. The case was closed in 2023, but the Netherlands filed a complaint against Russia at the European Court of Human Rights, directly accusing President Vladimir Putin of having authorized the operation. Separately, the International Civil Aviation Agency is still investigating responsibility, with a view to a possible civil lawsuit. The Kremlin denies all accusations, saying the trial was a Russophobic farce typical of the turbulent times that Europe is experiencing. From the beginning of the investigation, the Russians have tried to shift the blame to Ukraine. First, they suggested that the missile that shot down the Boeing had been launched by a Kiev fighter jet. Then, they suggested that a Ukrainian anti-aircraft system had been responsible for the tragedy. With ties with the European Union cut over the 2022 invasion, the chances of an agreed solution are slim. The then Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, a harsh critic of Putin, will now be the Secretary General of NATO (the Western military alliance). The three convicted men live in Russia and will not be extradited — the most notorious of them, Girkin, ended up falling out of favor for criticizing Putin's conduct of the war and was sentenced to four years in prison this year for ""inciting extremism."" For the victims' families, all that remains are doubts. ""We will not rest until we reveal the truth,"" Ploeg said in the video. Over the years, the report has heard versions of what might have happened from people with access to security information in Moscow. The most likely scenario, they say, was an operational error on the part of the separatists, who mistook the Boeing on the Buk's radar for a Ukrainian plane.

When news of the plane's downing arrived, the initial reaction was one of shock and particular disbelief, given that Malaysia had lost an identical plane in the mysterious case of flight MH370, which had disappeared four months earlier after taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing with 239 people on board — a case that remains unsolved to this day.

But the reality on the ground would soon give rise to outrage over what had happened. Between late 2013 and early 2014, the pro-Russian government in Kiev faced protests and was overthrown. Putin responded by annexing Crimea and inciting a civil war in the Donbass, a region that includes the Donetsk and Lugansk areas.

For Ukrainian filmmaker Marina Er Gorbach, who used the downing of the plane as a backdrop for her award-winning ""Klondike"" (2023), the episode was the first warning shot about the gravity of the crisis and yet it ended up being ignored in the West.

In an interview with Folha last year, she stated that the sanctions applied to Moscow in 2014 were too lax, leading to the escalation of the civil war, which killed around 14,000 people, and the full invasion eight years later.

Russia, excluded from the 2024 Paris Olympics due to its offensive against Ukraine, said this Saturday (27) that the opening ceremony of the sporting event was a ""huge failure"", while Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban declared that the party reflected the ""fragility and disintegration of the West"".

Russian diplomatic spokeswoman Maria Zakharova highlighted on Telegram what she considered to be flaws in the show, which took place on Friday (26) on the Seine River.

""I had not planned to watch the opening. But after seeing the photos, I could not believe that it was not a 'deep fake' or photoshop"", she wrote on Telegram. The ceremony was not broadcast live on Russian television.

Zakharova cited, among other things, the “collapse of transport” after the French rail network was sabotaged, and “spectators sitting for hours in the pouring rain”. “The organisers did not think about cloud dispersion or awnings,” she added, referring to the Russian practice of sending planes before large outdoor events to try to break through the clouds. Zakharova also said that the centre of Paris had been “turned into a ghetto for the homeless” and that “rats had flooded the streets” of the capital. The spokeswoman was particularly critical of the presence of drag queens at one point during the ceremony, whose performance was reminiscent of Jesus Christ’s Last Supper with his apostles. “In Paris, they decided that if the Olympic rings are multicoloured, you can turn the whole thing into a giant gay march,” she added. Only 16 Russian athletes accepted the invitation from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to participate in the event under a neutral flag.

""They have gradually eliminated metaphysical ties, with God, homeland and family,"" the Hungarian prime minister said, adding that this has led to ""the absence of public morality.""

The lawsuit filed by Ukraine in January 2017 made several accusations against Russia, holding it responsible for the attacks in Donetsk and the downing of Boeing MH17. This Wednesday (31), the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found the country not guilty.

Following the verdict of the international court linked to the United Nations (UN), Russian Senator from Sevastopol Ekaterina Altabayeva told Sputnik that the decision is only the first step towards the truth about the situation in Ukraine.

In a historic decision, the court did not give in to Kiev's demands, which essentially asked for Russia to be recognized as an ""aggressor state"" and the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) as ""terrorist organizations"".

Most of Ukraine’s claims against Russia in Crimea under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination were also rejected, ICJ President Joan Donoghue announced.

“In particular, this signals that the time will come when the Ukrainian government will be assessed. This is the first step, and the assessment of the Ukrainian regime and the investigation of the crimes of certain politicians, members of terrorist organizations such as ‘Azov’ in Ukraine will take place; I am sure that this will happen in the foreseeable future.”

The senator also stressed that the court’s decisions “put Ukraine in its place.”

“I believe this is an important signal to the international community; He says that it is necessary to objectively assess what is happening in Ukraine,"" he added. 

Kyiv's accusations

The proceedings, initiated by Kyiv in January 2017, addressed several issues, one of which was Russia's responsibility for the downing of a Boeing MH17 plane. However, the court rejected this demand, finding Russia not guilty of the incident. 

Furthermore, the court did not support Ukraine's arguments about Russia's alleged involvement and the responsibility of Donetsk militias in several attacks, including the shelling of the Bugas military checkpoint near Volnovakha; the military airfield in Kramatorsk; and the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Mariupol and Avdeevka, which occurred between 2014 and 2017. 

With regard to the accusations of financing terrorism, the court indicated that Russia had fulfilled its obligations to cooperate, including identifying and blocking funds used to finance terrorism.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Workers from Texas to Ohio are benefiting from Washington's push to supply arms to Kiev, Lloyd Austin said.

The conflict in Ukraine is ""a boon to the US economy"" as it has created more jobs in the US military-industrial sector, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. Speaking at a White House Competition Council meeting on Tuesday (5), the Pentagon chief promised that Washington would continue to push for a stronger defense industry, especially in light of the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

Austin said that US military assistance to Kiev has not only ""saved lives"" and kept Ukraine in the fight, but has also strengthened the US economy.

""These investments have expanded facilities and created jobs for American workers. And the weapons we send to Ukraine to help defend itself are made in the United States by American workers all across the country — from Texas to Ohio to Arizona,"" the official added. The conflict in Ukraine has also highlighted the need to improve military production, according to Austin, who stressed coordination with Washington's allies. He also urged U.S. lawmakers to adopt a national security package that would provide $60 billion to Kiev. The bill remains stalled in Congress amid opposition from Republicans, who have demanded that the White House address the security crisis on the border with Mexico. The United States has been Ukraine’s main military backer, providing Kyiv with about $45 billion in weapons between January 2022 and January 2024, while total commitments have reached more than $70 billion, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Reports suggest that the U.S. push to arm Ukraine has put significant strain on the country’s own arsenals. 

While officials in President Joe Biden’s administration have maintained that most funding for Ukraine is being spent domestically, some Republicans have criticized the White House for allocating taxpayer dollars to foreign countries rather than directly addressing domestic problems. 

According to a December poll by the Pew Research Center, 31% of Americans believe the U.S. is providing too much support to Ukraine, while 29% say the current level of assistance is about right. 

Russia has repeatedly denounced Western arms shipments to Ukraine, warning that they will only prolong the conflict. Russian Foreign Ministry official Maria Zakharova said in December that the US would likely continue to fuel the conflict in Ukraine into 2024 as long as it could withdraw funds from American taxpayers.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The attack on a Ukrainian military convoy in the Donetsk People's Republic was carried out using short-range ballistic missiles.

The crews of Patriot air defense systems supplied to Ukraine by the US, previously destroyed by Russian forces, were ""almost certainly"" eliminated, Forbes magazine reported.

The media outlet reported that the ""persistence and good fortune"" of a Russian drone operator ""paid off on Saturday (9) when he located a Ukrainian convoy including at least two truck-mounted quadruple launchers for a Patriot surface-to-air missile battery"" in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR).

""The Ukrainians lost up to 13 percent of their Patriot launchers that day,"" so ""the air over eastern Ukraine may have become much safer for the Russians,"" according to Forbes.

The report comes after a security source told Sputnik that two Patriot systems were among the military equipment of Ukrainian troops destroyed by a strike by the Russian Iskander surface-to-surface ballistic missile in the DPR. 

Data from the Russian Defense Ministry showed that the strike also destroyed an S-300 missile system of Ukrainian troops near the town of Pokrovsky in the DPR. 

The last time the Russian military hit a Patriot was in late February, when the launcher, tractor, ammunition and transport vehicle of the system were destroyed by high-precision weapons. 

In May 2023, the Russian Defense Ministry reported that its forces had destroyed a Patriot stationed in Kiev with a Kinzhal hypersonic missile. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced a successful strike on another Patriot two weeks later.

According to Russian data, the European Union (EU) has made recommendations to Ukraine that it is necessary to invest in the supply of long-range weapons to ""hit the heart of Russia"", said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday (16).

During his speech at the Euromaidan: Ukraine's Lost Decade conference, Lavrov also said that Western instructors directly help direct Ukrainian troops' strikes at Russian targets, and the West is participating in the war against Russia.

""There is no doubt that the West has declared war on us, they do not even hide it. And although they say in every possible way that 'they are just arming Ukraine, and it is fighting for itself', everyone understands that this is a lie.

He stressed that ""the most important thing in a war is strategies, and strategies are not in Kiev, but far away"".

""According to our data, the European External Action Service has made recommendations for Ukraine, which assume that the methods by which Ukraine is currently fighting will not be successful and Ukraine will lose. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on transferring weapons of even greater range to Ukraine, so that, as the European Union describes it, they will 'hit the heart of Russia', and thus once again sow confusion and panic and undermine the people's confidence,"" Lavrov said during his speech. 

The Russian Foreign Minister noted that the limit of Moscow's ""gestures of goodwill"" in the context of restoring relations between Russia and the West has been exhausted, Western countries have not reciprocated Russia's ""good deeds."" 

After Russian President Vladimir Putin's interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson, it became clear that until now the US society has been living in a complete information blockade, Lavrov noted. 

Finally, the Russian Foreign Minister said that on the issue of dialogue with Ukraine, the ball is not in Russia's court, first of all, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky must revoke the decree prohibiting negotiations with Moscow. 

""I repeat once again about the existence of Zelensky's decree, which prohibits negotiations with the government of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.

Cases of the use of US chemical weapons were recorded during the special military operation, the head of the Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defence Forces of the Russian Armed Forces, Igor Kirillov, said on Monday (19).

According to him, two facilities in the US still store highly toxic reactive compounds that remained after the destruction of declared stockpiles of American chemical weapons.

The US was supposed to complete the destruction of declared stockpiles of chemical weapons in 2007, but did so only in 2023, Kirillov noted in a statement.

""The United States still retains highly toxic compounds after the destruction of chemical agents at the facilities in Blue Grass (Kentucky) and Pueblo (Colorado),"" the Russian lieutenant general said.

According to him, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have repeatedly used toxic substances against Russian soldiers.

As an example, Kirillov cited the use on August 19, 2022, of a toxic chemical that is an analogue of the chemical warfare agent B-Zet included in Annex 2 of the Biological and Chemical Weapons Convention (BWC).

All documents at the disposal of the Russian Defense Ministry confirming the facts of violations by the United States and Ukraine of the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention have been handed over to the Investigative Committee of Russia for making a procedural decision, he said.

A similar substance, according to Kirillov, was discovered on January 28, 2024 during an operational search in a cache on the territory of Melitopol. ""The toxic substance was in vials with the inscription Biosporin in Ukrainian.""

Kirillov noted that Kiev is developing a “special chemical belt” tactic, which involves detonating containers with hydrocyanic acid and ammonia during the advance of the Russian Armed Forces.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces use toxic compounds not only in the course of hostilities, but also for carrying out terrorist acts. Thus, in August 2022, the head of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, was poisoned with ricin. On December 5, 2023, Leonid Pasechnik, the head of the administration of the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR), was seriously poisoned with phenolic compounds.

From September to October 2023, the chemicals were delivered to Kramatorsk and Kupyansk to be placed along the roads, said the head of the Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops of the Russian Armed Forces, Igor Kirillov.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The recent arrest of a Russian man for alleged ""destabilizing"" activities against the Paris Games highlights the last-minute concerns of organizers that Moscow may try to disrupt the event, which begins next Friday (26).

The man, born in 1984, was arrested at his home in Paris this week and is suspected of ""espionage with a foreign power to provoke hostilities in France"", the prosecutor's office said last Tuesday (23).

The newspaper Le Monde reported that the police found documents ""of diplomatic interest"" in his apartment, and that he is suspected of working for the Russian security service, the FSB, after appearing on reality TV shows and having worked for a time as a chef in a French ski resort.

“We strongly believed that he would organize destabilization, interference and espionage operations,” French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin told BFMTV on Wednesday (24), pointing to a variety of clues: “It could be cyber attacks that require complicity, it could be information manipulation...”.

The individual “is in the hands of the justice system, which could clarify the police’s suspicions,” explained the minister, commenting that the suspect’s presence on French soil is recent.

- Campaign to discredit the Games -

Darmanin recalled that “other Russian individuals” were recently arrested in the capital, and that French authorities have been observing a disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the Paris Olympic Games.

The minister recalled a very recent video on social media by an alleged representative of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, who threatened France with attacks for hosting Israeli athletes, but which turned out to be false content.

“We believe that this is a fake video spread by accounts that, from what we can see, are pro-Kremlin, pro-Russia,” the minister said, denouncing a “multiplicity” of maneuvers that could “cause damage to our country and raise concerns.”

Almost all Russian athletes have been banned from competing in the Paris Games as a diplomatic retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and only fifteen will participate under a neutral flag.

Over the weekend, Darmanin revealed that French authorities have rejected a “large number” of requests from Russian citizens to be accredited as journalists and cover the Games, due to suspicions that they may in fact be spies. Requests from Russian citizens to volunteer have also been denied.

Russia has denied its involvement in any destabilization operation against the Paris Games and said that refusing accreditation to Russian reporters “violates press freedom.”

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the United States on Sunday that if Washington deploys long-range missiles in Germany, Russia would position similar missiles within striking distance of the West.

The United States said on July 10 it would begin deploying long-range missiles in Germany from 2026, in preparation for a long-term deployment that will include SM-6s, Tomahawk cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons under development.

In a speech to sailors from Russia, China, Algeria and India to mark Russian Navy Day in the former imperial capital of St. Petersburg, Putin warned the United States that it risked triggering a Cold War-style missile crisis with the announcement.

""The flight time to targets of such missiles on our territory, which in the future could be equipped with nuclear warheads, will be about 10 minutes,"" Putin said.

“We will take mirrored measures, taking into account the actions of the United States, its satellites in Europe and other regions of the world.”

Putin, who sent his army into Ukraine in 2022, sees the war as part of a historic struggle with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 by invading what it sees as Moscow’s sphere of influence.

Ukraine and the West say Putin is engaged in an imperial-style land grab. They have vowed to defeat Russia, which currently controls about 18 percent of Ukraine, including Crimea, and parts of four regions in eastern Ukraine.

The French government intends to build an alliance with the Baltic nations (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) that agree to the proposal to send troops to fight Russia, according to an article published by the US edition of Politico.

According to the article published this Saturday (9), the proposal was made by the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Stéphane Séjourné, during his meeting in Lithuania last Friday (8), with Baltic counterparts and the Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dmitry Kuleba.

""It is not up to Russia to organize how we should implement our actions or establish red lines. So we decide that between us"", declared the French minister, as reported by Politico.

Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron surprised many in Europe by saying that he does not rule out sending ground troops to Ukraine.

Despite opposition to Macron's statement from most EU countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are much more open to the idea, the article says.

On February 27, Macron reported that Western leaders discussed the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine during a conference held in Paris, but did not reach a consensus.

On February 29, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned in his annual address to the Federal Assembly, the country's parliament, of the tragic consequences if this decision were to be implemented.

Moscow has repeatedly warned that NATO is “playing with fire” by supplying arms to Ukraine and that foreign arms shipments would be a “legitimate target” for Russia once they crossed the border.

The group's advance was one of the reasons that led to the special military operation in Ukraine.

In an interview with Sputnik, the parliamentarian stressed that the country will be forced to respond to the advance of the Western alliance, which has increasingly threatened international stability.

""Sweden's entry into NATO, of course, cannot but cause concern. Sweden has a very significant military force on the continent, and its neutrality for many years has ensured a balance of power both in the Baltic Sea and in Europe as a whole,"" said the politician.

With this, the senator points out, Russia will not remain inactive and ""will be forced to respond to NATO's aggressive advance by strengthening its Western military presence"".

""Our country has been ensuring the safety of navigation in the Baltic Sea for many centuries and will not allow its unilateral militarization"", the senator noted.

In recent weeks, statements have been made about a possible direct armed conflict between NATO and Russia, with the alliance's involvement in the fighting in Ukraine. In addition, Moscow has been warning for years about the organization's unprecedented increase in activity on its Western borders and that this will not be ignored.

Under the justification of ""containing Russian aggression"", the country has repeatedly expressed its concern about the alliance's increase in forces in Europe.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has stated that Moscow remains open to dialogue with NATO, but on equal terms, while the West must abandon the militarization of the continent.

President Vladimir Putin, in an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson, explained in detail that Moscow has no intention of attacking NATO countries.

An investigative journalist has assessed the situation surrounding the Russian gas pipelines, the investigation into which has already been abandoned by Sweden and Denmark, a move he sees as an attempt to hide the truth.

On Monday (26), Denmark became the second European country to officially close its investigation into the explosion in the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines.

Nord Stream has played a crucial role in supplying German industry and providing low-cost energy across Europe.

Observers immediately blamed the United States for the event, which took place in September 2022, highlighting US President Joe Biden's enigmatic promise to ""put an end"" to the project if Russia deployed its troops in Ukraine in response to the oppression of the Russian-speaking population of Donbass. Denmark’s inquiry found that the explosions were an act of “deliberate sabotage,” but authorities have refused to investigate who was responsible.

Earlier this month, Sweden closed its own investigation.

“It’s an absolute farce,” investigative journalist Dan Lazare said on Wednesday (28).

“I don’t know how much longer this can go on. I mean, Denmark investigated, they came to a conclusion, and everyone knows that it was obviously sabotage — that was obvious from the beginning. And [Denmark] is refraining from pointing the finger at a likely culprit.”

He said he was 100 percent convinced that “the United States” was to blame and that “Denmark, Sweden, everyone is afraid to say this.” It's extraordinary."" Lazare sees the situation benefiting far-right parties across the continent, such as the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which are the only ones willing to openly acknowledge the US's role in the act. ""So if the AfD is rising in the polls, they have Joe Biden to thank, because Joe Biden blew up the pipeline, and everyone is afraid to admit it,"" Lazare concluded, also mentioning Donald Trump in the US, Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Giorgia Meloni in Italy. ""The centre is self-destructing and is now practically introducing the far right to take its place,"" he said, predicting that establishment lawmakers ""will pay a terrible, terrible price for covering this up [the Nord Stream sabotage].""

China's defense minister says cooperation between Moscow and Beijing is a cornerstone for maintaining world peace and praised Russia's stance on Taiwan.

In his first public appearance since being appointed defense minister late last year, Dong Jun told his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu that strategic cooperation between China and Russia is a cornerstone for maintaining world peace.

During a video call meeting, the officials agreed that China and Russia should deepen their cooperation and respond decisively to global challenges.

""We have supported them on the Ukraine issue, despite the US and the European Union continuing to pressure the Chinese side,"" Dong said, promising that Beijing ""will not change or abandon our established political course on this issue"" even under the threat of more sanctions.

At the same time, according to the Chinese minister, China sees the ""strong support of the Russian side on the Taiwan issue, as well as on other issues of our core interests,"" he added. ""As two of the most important and fundamental forces in the world, we must respond decisively to global challenges,"" he reiterated. Dong also criticized the United States' attempt to maintain its hegemony by targeting Russia and China. ""History and reality prove that hegemony is doomed to failure."" The Russian minister said that, unlike Western states, Russia and China are not ""creating military blocs"" and military cooperation between the two is not ""directed against third countries."" Shoigu noted that ""Russian-Chinese relations in the military sphere are developing steadily in all areas"" and said he was looking forward to ""close and productive cooperation"" with his Chinese counterpart. China's stance on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has created tensions between the Asian country and the United States. US officials accuse Beijing of supporting Moscow rather than demonstrating neutrality. China, for its part, blames the extension of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Europe for the crisis in Ukraine and has denounced the use of unilateral sanctions by the US and its allies as a tool of geopolitical pressure.","['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The document ""Voluntary guidance for integrated fire management: principles and strategic actions"" updates two-decade-old guidelines from this UN (United Nations) agency and includes new recommendations ""to address the challenges arising from the current climate crisis"", the organization said in a statement.

By the end of the century, extreme wildfires are expected to become around 50% more frequent and environmental changes linked to climate change, such as more frequent droughts, high temperatures and strong winds, ""will likely result in hotter, drier and longer fire seasons"".

According to the FAO, around 340 million to 370 million hectares of the Earth's surface are burned annually by wildfires, with losses to sustainable development and the livelihoods of communities and generating large volumes of greenhouse gas emissions.

The Foreign Ministers of Russia and China met on Thursday (25) and discussed the construction of ""a new security architecture"", Moscow reported, after the meeting that took place on the sidelines of the meeting of ministers of the National Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), in Laos.

At the meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, discussed in ""detail"" issues of cooperation within the framework of ASEAN, the Russian minister said in a statement published after the meeting in Vientiane, the capital of Laos.

Lavrov said that, at a time when ""some countries"" are creating ""a close alliance"" with political-military mechanisms aimed at undermining security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, the two Foreign Ministers discussed the construction of ""a new security architecture"".

A Ukrainian court on Friday (26) ordered the pre-trial detention of the suspect in last week's murder of former ultra-nationalist MP Irina Farion, local media reported.

Farion was a member of parliament from 2012 to 2014 for the ultra-nationalist Svoboda party and was known for her passionate campaign against the use of the Russian language in Ukraine.

Ukrainian state-run media outlet Suspilne reported that a court in Lviv, in western Ukraine, ordered the suspect to be held in pre-trial detention for 60 days pending trial.

The defendant identified himself as Vyacheslav Zinchenko and was arrested this week in Dnipro, 800 kilometers east of Lviv.

The 18-year-old - who did not plead guilty - is charged with premeditated murder and could face a 15-year prison sentence.

Authorities announced Thursday the arrest of a suspect in the murder of Farion, a 60-year-old linguist who caused controversy for her staunch defense of the Ukrainian language after the Russian invasion that began in February 2022.

In 2023, Farion caused controversy by criticizing Ukrainian soldiers who continued to speak Russian while facing Moscow's troops.

Before the invasion, the use of Russian was widespread in Ukraine, especially in the eastern regions. Since then, many people have decided to stop speaking Russian, and the authorities have promoted Ukrainian.

Amorim stated that ""adopting Ukraine's principled and radical position"" will not resolve the country's conflict with Russia. The diplomat defended the negotiation proposal signed by Brazil and China at the end of May. According to him, with the impasse in the attempt to find a resolution based on what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky proposes, the plan drawn up by Brasília and Beijing is beginning to be noticed by other countries.

There is a positive harmony between Brazil and China, which are large countries, defend the UN Charter, defend non-intervention, and defend territorial integrity. Implicitly, there is a lot of criticism of Russia, but there is also no point in adopting Ukraine's principled and radical position, which will not work.

513,PT_37.txt,"Ukraine cannot be discussed 'without addressing NATO's eastward expansion', says US observer

Russia has repeatedly warned NATO against expanding into Eastern Europe, which the Kremlin says could further fuel tensions in Europe.

American political commentator and podcaster Candace Owens stressed the importance of linking the conflict in Ukraine to NATO's continued expansion towards Russia's borders.

""No serious person can discuss what happened in that region without addressing the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the east, despite the promises made by our government officials that we would not do so after German reunification,"" the observer wrote on her X account (formerly Twitter).

Owens noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""stated this reason in virtually every speech he made before and after"" the start of Moscow's special military operation.

The remarks came after the Russian head of state last year rebuked the US-led military bloc for repeatedly making “empty promises” not to expand eastward. In an interview with Chinese television, Putin noted that there have been “five waves” of expansion since the US administration assured Russia in 1991 that NATO would not expand eastward.

“And every time we expressed our concerns, they said to us: well, yes, we promised that NATO would not expand eastward, but these were verbal promises, specifically, where is the piece of paper with our signature? There is no such paper, so goodbye. You see, it is very difficult to have a dialogue with these people,” the Russian president noted.

Earlier, Putin made it unequivocally clear that if Ukraine were to potentially join NATO, it would pose a threat to Russia’s security and would in no way enhance Ukraine’s own security.

He also stressed that one of the reasons for the Russian special military operation is “the threat of Ukraine joining NATO.”

In recent years, the Atlantic Alliance has particularly ignored Moscow’s offers to NATO and the United States that sought to provide security guarantees. These proposals included an agreement that would impose a mutual commitment by Russia and NATO to refrain from deploying troops, ships or aircraft near each other.

In addition, Moscow has called for an immediate halt to NATO’s expansion towards Russia’s borders, stressing the importance of refraining from inviting post-Soviet countries into the bloc or deploying military infrastructure on their territories.","['URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The West’s proxy war against Russia in Ukraine is seen as on a downward trajectory to decimate the previously fearsome reputation of NATO’s expensive, high-tech weaponry. At the same time, Russian forces have unleashed a series of surprises in the conflict zone with updated, cutting-edge military technology.

However, another Russian weapon has reportedly piqued the interest of Western media outlets, amid concerns that it could add to Kiev’s headaches.

The new UMPB D-30SN interspecific glide munition appears to be generating a lot of interest because this precision-guided winged bomb is an over-the-range weapon that is rumoured to be suitable for launch from aircraft and ground-based multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) such as Russia’s Tornado-S.

An over-the-range weapon can be launched from a great distance, allowing its user to avoid defensive fire from the target.

“If it can also be launched from the ground, it would provide extended and accurate range for Russian rocket artillery systems without the need to risk tactical aircraft. This could be especially useful for hitting time-sensitive targets at long ranges, such as artillery positions and air defense systems,” wrote the US-based news portal The War Zone (TWZ).

According to the publication, while details about the munition were still limited, the glide weapon, which resembles a small-diameter bomb, drew parallels with the US GBU-39 small-diameter bomb, which can also be launched from both air and ground.

According to reports, the Canadian Armed Forces have more than 83,000 of the missiles, which were retired from service in the early 2000s and would be dismantled.

A spokesman for Canadian Defence Minister Daniel Minden confirmed that the government is considering transferring the missiles.

""Before we transfer equipment to Ukraine, we work closely with Ukraine to ensure that any donations meet their military needs. We apply the same process to the CRV7 missile stockpile,"" Minden told the broadcaster.

However, a defence source said that not all of these missiles have warheads. According to the TV station, only about 8,000 missiles still have warheads in good condition.

Earlier, the United Kingdom proposed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to discuss sending an expeditionary force to Ukraine, as well as establishing a no-fly zone over the territory controlled by the Kiev authorities.

The offers come amid a series of problems between President Vladimir Zelensky's regime and the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which even this week saw rumors of an alleged dismissal of commander Valery Zaluzhny, which was subsequently denied by Kiev.

Russia previously sent a note to NATO countries on arms supplies to Ukraine, in which Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov noted that any cargo containing weapons for Ukraine would become a legitimate target for Russia.

It is worth recalling that in an interview with the BBC, Zelensky stated that talks with the Russian side were possible, despite the decree in force in Ukraine prohibiting such talks. ""By putting pressure on Russia, I believe that it is possible to reach a diplomatic agreement. I think the power of diplomacy can help,"" the Ukrainian president said.

A study developed by NASA researchers revealed that a large part of Brazil could become uninhabitable within 50 years, due to the increase in temperatures on the planet. In addition to Brazilian lands, territories in Asia and the Middle East are also at risk of becoming inhospitable.

Published in the journal Science Advances, the analysis was developed by the team of researcher Colin Raymond, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. To reach the results, the scientists observed extremes of heat and humidity across the globe, using satellite images and wet bulb temperature projections, a method that allows the measurement of humidity in the air.

It is important to analyze humidity because, when it manifests itself in excess, it hinders the evaporation of sweat, which impairs the body's ability to dissipate heat and, consequently, overheats the body. Thus, the combination of high levels of humidity and extreme temperatures can be lethal.

AFFECTED REGIONS

According to research by the US space agency, the Central-West, Northeast, North and Southeast regions of Brazil will be the most affected in the country.

There is no exact date to determine when conditions in these places will become hostile, but scientists believe that the process should happen in the coming decades, driven by deforestation and the reckless consumption of natural resources.

In addition to Brazil, parts of Southeast Asia will also suffer the consequences of global warming, and may record worrying combinations of temperature and humidity by 2070.

In the Middle East, the regions near the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are the most threatened. Known for their already high temperatures, these locations will see the thermometers rise even further in the coming decades, and may become uninhabitable within the next 46 years.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An area equivalent to three cities in São Paulo can have its native caatinga vegetation recovered from deforestation and desertification. The information is contained in a survey released this week by the Dutch foundation IDH and the research institute WRI Brasil, both linked to sustainable initiatives. According to the study, the areas are located in Cariri Ocidental, in Paraíba; in Sertão do Pajeú, in Pernambuco; and in Sertão do Apodi, in Rio Grande do Norte.

The research highlights that native vegetation, if restored in these 500 thousand hectares, can offer sustainable income and jobs for local populations. This, in addition to providing water regulation, soil stabilization and erosion control. As explained by WRI Brasil's Projects and Research Coordinator, Luciana Alves:

""In the Caatinga, investments directed at productive restoration and also ecological restoration are an opportunity to establish processes for conservation and restoration, but which will also bring social results, economic results and maintenance for the people who already live in this territory, in addition to providing ecological benefits that are fundamental for the processes of adaptation and mitigation of climate change"".

The survey also points out the best ways to recover these areas. Among them, honey production, planting forage palm - to feed livestock -, fruit crops, raising goats and goats, all within the Agroforestry System. This agricultural practice combines trees and shrubs with agricultural crops and raising animals in the same area.

According to Mapbiomas' Annual Deforestation Report, deforestation in the Caatinga has advanced in recent years. In 2023, for example, 201,687 hectares of Caatinga were destroyed; an increase of 43.3% compared to 2022.

In June of this year, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change selected 12 priority projects for the creation of federal conservation units in the caatinga.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union will transfer €1.5 billion in frozen Russian assets to Ukraine on Friday, 26.

The decision comes after G7 and EU leaders agreed last month to use $50 billion of the profits from Russian assets frozen in European banks to finance arms purchases and reconstruction of the war-torn country.

“Today we are transferring €1.5 billion in revenue from frozen Russian assets to the defence and reconstruction of Ukraine. There is no better symbol or use for Kremlin money than making Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live,” von der Leyen wrote on her social media.

Western governments have frozen $300 billion in Russia’s central bank in response to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal thanked the EU for “its firm support and this significant contribution to the defence and reconstruction of Ukraine”. “Together, we are turning adversity into strength and building a more secure and resilient Europe,” he said. What Russia says Following the EU’s announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the transfer of frozen Russian assets to Ukraine “illegal” and said Russia would take “thoughtful action” in response. “Such measures by the European Commission will not go unanswered,” he said.

Guterres repeated his call for humanity to fight its ""dependence"" on fossil fuels.

""Today, our focus is on the impact of extreme heat. But let's not forget that there are many other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: hurricanes of unprecedented violence, floods, droughts, forest fires, rising sea levels. The list goes on,"" he said.

""To address all these symptoms, we need to address the disease. And the disease is the madness of burning down our only home. The disease is dependence on fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction,"" he stressed, calling in particular for G20 countries to take action.

While 2023 was the hottest year on record, 2024 could break a new record, with temperatures well above 40ºC becoming increasingly common.

In the space of a year, the 50°C limit has been exceeded in at least ten places, from Death Valley in the United States (53.9°C on 7 July) to Agadir in Morocco, but also in China, India and Brazil.

However, intense heat, often less visible than other devastating impacts of climate change, such as storms and floods, is more deadly.

This ""silent killer"" was responsible for around 489,000 deaths per year between 2000 and 2019, compared with 16,000 deaths per year caused by cyclones, according to the document ""Call to Action"", published this Thursday by the United Nations.

Exposed workers

Extremely high temperatures also have an economic impact. The UN estimates that losses caused by heat stress at work will reach US$2.4 trillion (R$13.5 trillion) by 2030.

According to a report by the International Labour Organization published this Thursday, more than 70% of workers were exposed to extreme heat in 2020, 8.8% more than in 2000.

""The good news is that we can save lives and limit this impact,"" Guterres said this Thursday.

The UN called on the global community to act first to protect ""the most vulnerable"", including young children, the elderly and the poorest.

In this context, early warning systems should include extreme heat, alerting populations about the arrival of heat waves and informing them about precautions to take, the document added.

The call to action also recommends ""increasing equitable access and scaling up low-carbon cooling"".

This would include investments in passive cooling systems – which include climate-sensitive urban measurements, reflective surfaces and natural cooling systems – as well as the elimination of greenhouse gases, which are used in many cooling systems.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Russia has never renounced dialogue, it has always been open to the negotiation process, the spokesman told reporters, commenting on Kuleba's remarks at a meeting in the city of Guangzhou with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.

According to Peskov, the statement by the Ukrainian Foreign Minister that his country was ready to start negotiations is in line with Moscow's position. We know from reports that this statement was made at the meeting with Mr. Wang Yi, he stressed.

The spokesman said that the details are not known at the moment, but they are important for moving forward in this direction.

The last round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine on the cessation of hostilities took place on March 29, 2022 in the Turkish city of Istanbul, and since then the countries have not resumed negotiations.

Moscow has repeatedly stated its willingness to resume dialogue, but has made it conditional on Ukraine revoking its decree prohibiting the resumption of peace talks.

President Vladimir Putin has already set several conditions for opening peace talks, including that Ukraine withdraw its troops from the four new Russian territories (Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye) and that it give up its plans to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

He also demands that Ukraine maintain its neutral, non-aligned and non-nuclear status and that all sanctions against Russia be lifted. Ukraine has rejected the Russian proposal as an ultimatum.

Russian forces have been conducting a special military operation since February 2022 to prevent Ukrainian shelling of civilians in Donetsk and Luhansk, two territories that gained independence from Ukraine in 2014 and joined Russia in September 2022.

After a meeting between US President Joe Biden and US congressional leaders, the congressman warns that aid to Ukraine should not be at the top of the agenda of the country's lawmakers.

Ukraine will be defeated by Russia if it does not get help from the US, and the allies of the Kiev regime will distance themselves from Washington.

The statement was made this Tuesday (27) by the Democratic leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, after a meeting between US President Joe Biden and congressional leaders.

""The consensus in the room was that [Vladimir] Zelensky and Ukraine will lose the war if we do not provide weapons quickly,"" Schumer told reporters after the meeting.

Schumer said that US aid to Ukraine cannot wait for congressional approval, since Washington cannot allow Kiev to lose the conflict.

""At best, there will be a split in NATO [the North Atlantic Treaty Organization], and allies will turn away from the United States,"" the congressman said. He added that there are four brigades of the Ukrainian Armed Forces idle on the battlefield due to a lack of weapons and ammunition. Due to the position of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, the US Congress has not yet supported the Biden administration's request to approve new funds for Kiev.

The United States and Europe are supplying Ukraine with obsolete weapons that need to be retired. At the same time, these nations are praising their commitment to the country's cause, according to the National Interest, a US magazine specializing in international relations.

The media outlet also stressed that the weapons given to Kiev are ""little better than trash"".

France, for example, has supplied AMX-10RC armoured vehicles, also known as light armoured tanks. However, the origins of this tank date back to the early 1980s and its last upgrade was in 2000.

The French army began dismantling these tanks in 2021, after they were deemed unsustainable for modern warfare. When these tanks were deployed for the special military operation, the Russian Armed Forces were happy to help France finish the dismantling process.

The Challenger-2 main battle tanks supplied to Ukraine were also at the end of their service life and had zero effect on the battlefield, according to the report.

The National Interest added that the US promise to supply more than 30 M1 Abrams main battle tanks caused euphoria in Kiev, but no one noticed the observation that the modern and updated version of the Abrams main battle tanks was not available.

Similarly, the overpriced F-16 fighters promised to Kiev will also not make any changes on the battlefield, as they are at the end of their service life, while Russia has fifth-generation jets that can destroy US warplanes with little effort.

The situation makes columnists wonder whether the conflict in Ukraine is not just a mere business for Western governments, while the lives of the Ukrainian people are used as symbolic money.

“A cynical person might conclude that this was deliberate, part of a larger plan to drain Western arsenals of weapons platforms deemed obsolete, in order to force these governments to buy more expensive and modern systems from Western defense contractors,” the magazine wrote. 

However, even top-quality Western weaponry is unlikely to change the tide of the conflict, since the Ukrainian military is not trained to use it properly.

Recommendations have been sent to the US Department of Defense regarding the need to ensure proper tracking of the path and use of US weapons in Ukraine. In January, Russia reported that illegal shipments had been detected as far as the Gaza Strip.

The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has presented a series of recommendations to the Department of Defense to ensure proper tracking of the path and use of weapons delivered by the country to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Reuters reports.

The audit and oversight body is linked to the US Congress, which, according to the report, weapons supplied by Washington take weeks to reach the country. In addition, the Pentagon does not provide clear guidance on tracking these deliveries, and the data from this military body is not necessarily accurate in this regard.

To ensure traceability, the GAO made eight recommendations, including improving the accuracy of supply data and evaluating Ukraine’s approach to controlling the end-use of weapons. It also calls on the Defense Department to develop a procedure to help regularly assess and improve the accuracy of delivery data and to develop written guidance to document roles and responsibilities. The Pentagon rejected the recommendation to clarify guidance for documenting alleged violations of the end-use of weapons, although it did accept five of the suggested measures and partially two others. Last month, it was reported that Pentagon investigators had opened more than 50 criminal investigations into “procurement fraud, product substitution, theft, fraud or corruption, and diversion” of U.S. aid to Ukraine.

During the conversation, the ""gray cardinal of the world government"" (as Schwab is called because he is an influential figure among globalists) admitted that the West's goal is to use Zelensky and deceive him.

""The European Union plays an important role in his influence. In other words, you have to use Zelensky. Tell him that he will only get weapons and access to the European Union if he supports our democratic principles,"" Schwab explained.

When Attali asked him whether Ukraine would accept the European Union and NATO if Zelensky fulfilled all the commitments he had made, Schwab replied in the negative.

“No, that is understandable, but the prospects for this must still be preserved,” he stressed.

It is worth noting that experts in Russia have been warning about this fraud for a long time. They said that the West, since Maidan 2014, has been using the EU and NATO as an attractive bait, forcing Ukraine to do what is beneficial to itself. At the same time, within the EU, everyone is well aware that Kiev will not be admitted, but as long as there is an illusion that this is possible, Ukrainians will do whatever they say.

It is worth noting that modern Ukraine does not meet the EU criteria in any of the parameters. It is a poor country with an extremely low standard of living, a huge amount of corruption and a totalitarian political regime, where all opposition is abolished, Christian persecution is carried out, the former president cancelled the elections and usurped power. None of this fits into the terms “freedom” and “democracy.” At the same time, the media and the official government in Europe continue to talk about Ukrainian “democracy,” so as not to scare Europeans with the fact that their countries are financing and arming a dictator.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Distrust towards Media']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The latest wave of Western sanctions targets entities that allow Moscow to evade restrictions, and the European Union has targeted 19 Chinese companies, several of which are based in Hong Kong.

""Mr. Kuleba called on the Hong Kong administration to take measures to prevent Russia and Russian companies from using Hong Kong to circumvent the restrictive measures imposed,"" Kiev's foreign ministry said in a statement.

""Russia's machinations must not damage Hong Kong's reputation as a highly developed liberal economy built on unshakable respect for the rule of law,"" the Ukrainian ministry continued.

According to the statement, ""these restrictive measures are necessary to weaken Russia's ability to wage war and kill people in Ukraine.""

A spokesperson for the Hong Kong government, when asked by Agence France Presse (AFP), said that the special administrative region of China ""strictly implements and applies UN Security Council sanctions.""

""Any action taken by the Government of the Special Administrative Region will be strictly in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong,"" he added.

Kuleba also discussed in Hong Kong the ""possibilities of trade and investment"" in the region.

The Ukrainian Foreign Minister began his first visit to China on Tuesday since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February 2022, with Beijing a key partner of Moscow and accused by the West of helping the Kremlin in its war effort.

During his talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, Kuleba indicated that Ukraine was ready to negotiate peace with Russia when the latter was ready to do so in ""good faith"".

At the meeting, the head of Kiev's diplomacy asked Beijing for support for a ""direct dialogue"" to end the conflict.

""In-depth, detailed and substantive discussions are planned with my Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on ways to achieve a just peace,"" the head of Kiev's diplomacy wrote on the social network Instagram.

The decision was announced by Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó in an interview with private television channel ATV, referring to the European fund that Budapest has been blocking since May.

""Until Ukraine resolves this issue, everyone should forget about paying the 6.6 billion euros,"" he said.

On Monday, Hungary and Slovakia asked the European Commission to mediate with Ukraine, after Kiev included the oil company Lukoil on its sanctions list, implying the end of oil transit to the two countries via the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline.

The minister stressed that Hungary will not support European Union (EU) financing for arms shipments to Ukraine while the energy security of the Central European country, which currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, remains at risk.

""Ukraine's decision not to allow Lukoil to transit oil through Ukraine poses a fundamental threat to the security of energy supplies to Hungary and Slovakia,"" Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said on Monday on the X social network.

Hungary and Slovakia depend primarily on Russian oil imports, and although sanctions on Lukoil have affected trade, the two countries continue to receive supplies from other Russian companies.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his Slovak counterpart Robert Fico, both described as ""pro-Russian"", have opposed military support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion and advocate a negotiated solution to end the conflict.

The Russian military offensive on Ukrainian territory, launched on February 24, 2022, has plunged Europe into what is considered the most serious security crisis since the Second World War (1939-1945).

Ukraine has been relying on financial and weapons aid from its Western allies, who have also imposed sanctions on key sectors of the Russian economy in an attempt to reduce Moscow’s ability to finance the war effort.

The past few months have been marked by large-scale Russian air strikes on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, while Kiev’s forces have targeted targets in Russian territory close to the border and on the Crimean peninsula, which it illegally annexed in 2014.

Now in the third year of war, the Ukrainian armed forces have been struggling with a shortage of soldiers and weapons and ammunition, despite repeated promises of aid from Western allies, which have now begun to materialize.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Earth recorded its hottest day in its entire historical series of temperature measurements this Sunday, July 21. And in the middle of summer in the northern hemisphere, many parts of the Mediterranean face extreme risks of forest fires.

The global value recorded broke the previous record, set a year ago, according to provisional data from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.

Global average temperatures have now reached or exceeded a key climate threshold for 12 months, highlighting the challenge of limiting global warming to less than 1.5ºC above the pre-industrial era, as established by the Paris Agreement.

– The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, seeks to limit global warming to less than 2ºC above the pre-industrial average and, ideally, to 1.5ºC.

Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, causing extreme weather events, from floods to forest fires – in Brazil, the floods in Rio Grande do Sul and the fires in the Pantanal and Amazon are examples. 

In southern Europe, global warming is causing temperatures to exceed 40ºC, as has been the case in Greece over the past two weeks. As a result, the threat of forest fires is increasing. 

In Greece, at least 33 forest fires broke out between Sunday and Monday 22. Athens and parts of the south of the country remain on high alert. 

Cooler weather will bring some relief this week to the Mediterranean nation, although temperatures are still expected to exceed 39ºC in parts of the European continent on Tuesday 23. 

Spain is also at extreme risk of fires this week, as temperatures rise in the south of the country. Seville and Cordoba will reach 43C on Wednesday 24th, according to the Spanish meteorological agency AEMET. 

Parts of southern France and Italy are also at risk of wildfires. Further north, Berlin and Paris – which will host the Olympic Games from this week – are expected to face heatwaves in early August. The average temperature in the German capital is expected to rise to 28C on 6th August, eight degrees above the 30-year normal. 

Extreme heat has already wreaked havoc on many parts of the global economy this year, affecting everything from air travel to power grids. 

The average temperature for the year to June was 1.64C higher than in the 1850-1900 era, according to Copernicus. Last month was the hottest on record, a record that has been broken for the 13th consecutive month.",['Other'],['Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""I do not exclude any option,"" said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov when asked about the possibility of deploying nuclear missiles if the United States of America (USA) confirms its decision, adding that such actions imply ""the definitive end of arms control agreements in that area.""

""In this situation, taking into account the combined capabilities of NATO member countries, we must evaluate our responses, without any internal limitations in terms of what, where and when [missiles] should or should not be deployed. This means that the options should be as broad as possible,"" the official noted, quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax.

In this sense, the deputy minister said that Russia's position ""does not pose a threat to anyone, it is simply seeking the most effective way, also in terms of costs, to respond to changing challenges.""

Ryabkov also assured that the Russian authorities will guarantee the security of the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad (a Russian enclave in the Baltic bordering Lithuania and Poland, two countries in the European Union and NATO), which has ""long attracted the attention of adversaries"".

""Should the representatives of the German government consider it justified to initiate measures for an escalation under the pretext of the situation in the region, we will respond with compensatory measures in the manner we consider most acceptable"", he stressed.

""Nothing will stop us from solving the problems for our security along the entire perimeter of the Russian borders"", he stressed.

Last week, Ryabkov had considered that ""the nature of Russia's reaction"" - should the US decide on such a measure, which would involve the first American shipment of these weapons to Germany since the end of the Cold War - ""will be decided calmly and professionally"".

The announcement by the United States and Germany indicates, as recalled today by the Spanish agency Europa Press, that the installation of long-range missiles aims to demonstrate Washington's ""commitment"" to NATO and a contribution to ""integrated European deterrence"", specifying that ""these conventional long-range units will include (missiles) SM-6, Tomahawk and latest-generation hypersonic weapons, with a significantly greater range than current ground-based materials in Europe"".

Poland today commented on opposition within the European Union (EU) to the use of dividends from frozen assets of the Central Bank of Russia (BCR) in Western financial institutions for the purchase of weapons for Ukraine, the capital's press reported.

Two EU countries are yet to reach a consensus on the use of profits from the retention of about $300 billion of the BCR in banks, said the head of Polish diplomacy, Rodoslav Sikorsky, quoted by radio station RMF24.

The country's Foreign Minister revealed that he raised the issue of frozen funds with his French counterpart, Stéphane Séjourné, during a recent meeting of EU foreign ministers.

Canada, the United States, Japan and the EU retain BCR assets, including almost $6 billion on US soil, while $210 billion is deposited in the Euroclear bank in Belgium.

Several European nations proposed at the time that dividends from frozen Russian money be used to finance Ukraine's rearmament, something that Moscow rejected, and which threatened to implement painful countermeasures. Russia also warned that such action would create a disastrous precedent for the international financial system, since many countries, especially developing ones, keep their assets in Western banks, given their high reliability, which would now be called into question. Despite this, the main leaders of the group of seven most industrialized countries (France, the United States, Japan, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany) agreed to allocate $50 billion to the purchase of weapons from Ukraine, using the funds withheld.","['URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The magnificent reception given to Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic in Paris by French President Emmanuel Macron during the Serbian's official visit to France was overshadowed by the disagreement between the two leaders over the Kosovo issue, expressed at their joint press conference.

While both agreed that the European Union (EU) is an area of ​​common interest, the Serbian president did not like the way Macron spoke about Kosovo and Metohija, that is, that both sides, Belgrade and Pristina, are making equal efforts.

The Serbian president disagreed, stressing that Kosovo had failed to comply with everything, from the Brussels and Ohrid agreements, to the elections in the north, the expropriation of Serbian lands, the presence of Kosovo police, and even the shooting of Serbian children.

Serbia's position clearly stated

Diplomat and former ambassador Branko Brankovic told Sputnik that the Serbian president acted correctly and moderately, but with a clear attitude that he did not agree with Macron on Kosovo and Metohija.

""Vucic was certainly very detailed in his private conversation with Macron, but it is important that he made it clear at the press conference that Serbia maintains the position that Kosovo is not a state and that what EU states do is the utmost hypocrisy,"" the diplomat stressed.

According to the former ambassador, by placing Serbia as a sovereign state and Kosovo as a protectorate on the same level, Macron has shown that his views on the matter will not change.

On the other hand, Brankovic notes, they are aware that the EU cannot be complete without Serbia, but only Serbia on its own terms. That is why there is a lot of talk about this, because they would have a lot of problems if Serbia turned its back on the EU.

""It turns out that France does not deviate from the positions of Europe and, above all, from the positions of the West, that is, the famous trio of the US, the UK and Germany, regarding Serbia's position at the moment. Therefore, for Serbia's international position and for everything else related to future cooperation related to Serbia's accession to the EU,"" Brankovic added.

In other words, for the diplomat, the situation showed that Macron has stuck to a well-known position: independent Kosovo, and let's forget about cooperation with Russia.

Western desperation

""In this whole issue, I see desperation on the part of the West, because they have to put pressure on us, since they have squandered all the trump cards they had in relation to Ukraine, and the very existence of the NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] pact has been seriously shaken,"" the diplomat said.

According to Brankovic, ""this means that the European Union must seriously think about what to do, because what they invested in Ukraine was in vain because Russia is winning there, regardless of Macron's words that Russia should not win.""

In the meantime, as he continued, ""not knowing how to get out of Ukraine and save face, Macron and the others are trying to use the Kosovo issue to force us to take some action, which would give them justification for NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and now Ukraine,"" the diplomat concluded.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

While Kiev publicly rejects accusations of being “hospitable” to international terrorism, even Ukrainian journalists admit that the country’s authorities are “strangely” turning a blind eye to the issue.

A high-ranking member of Daesh (a terrorist organisation banned in Russia and several other countries), Caesar Tokhosashvili, also known as al-Bara al-Shishani, lived “quietly” with his wife and three children in the Ukrainian town of Belaya Tserkov for more than a year before being tracked down and detained by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 2019, reports have revealed.

The news undermines Ukraine’s official stance against terrorism and indicates that the country continues to be a safe haven for such operatives.

The CIA operation to capture Tokhosashvili – who is of Georgian origin – was conducted in collaboration with the Georgian Interior Ministry and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). Even Western media at the time were left wondering: “Why did they choose not to arrest him earlier?”

What do we know about the notorious Daesh terrorist?

His arrest five years ago made global headlines, with The Independent quoting Philip Ingram, a former British intelligence officer, as admitting that Kiev’s “lax” government had created “an obvious vulnerability to international terrorism”, something he said “Kiev does not seem entirely interested in addressing”.

The former officer was echoed by Vera Mironova, a jihad expert and visiting fellow at Harvard University, who told The Independent that “hundreds” of former Daesh militants had “fled to Ukraine”.

“When these terrorists arrive in Ukraine, they rarely encounter any problems with the authorities,” Mironova said.

A similar tone was struck by Kyiv-based journalist Katerina Sergatskova, who noted that Ukrainian authorities remain “strangely relaxed about the issue.”

“Whenever I have written about the issue, government officials have accused me of making it up. But the arrest of a top Daesh commander here in Kyiv, right under our noses, would certainly suggest that many of the world’s most dangerous men think of Ukraine as a safe house.”

The SBU has repeatedly dismissed claims that Kyiv “was somehow hospitable to international terrorism.” Mironova warned that Ukrainian authorities would have “a big problem on their hands” if more Daesh members based in Ukraine “became terrified of being arrested.”","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""The Kiev regime has been waging a full-fledged terrorist war against Russia for some time now, as its representatives, such as Kirill Budanov [head of Ukrainian Military Intelligence] and Vasily Malyuk [head of the Ukrainian Security Service] openly claim,"" the statement said.

On Sunday (31), the Russian Foreign Ministry said it had sent Ukrainian authorities demands for the arrest and extradition of all those involved in the attack on the Crocus City Hall and other attacks in recent years.

The ministry mentioned the murders of journalists Daria Dugina and Vladlen Tatarsky, stressing that investigations ""indicate that traces of all these crimes lead to Ukraine.""","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The takeover of the Ukrainian parliament by the country's military would not be a popular move, expert Aleksandr Dudchak told Sputnik, suggesting that a potential rebellion was orchestrated from the West.

The disillusioned Ukrainian military is planning to take control of the Supreme Rada (Ukrainian parliament), an exchange of messages from a private Telegram channel called ParaBelum obtained by Sputnik reveals.

""This could be a scenario of replacing Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky without holding elections,"" Aleksandr Dudchak, a researcher at the Institute of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and an expert on the ""Other Ukraine"" movement, told Sputnik.

Members of the confidential channel, consisting of commanders and soldiers of elite units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, were discussing options for overthrowing the current government and its military command following the resignation of then-commander-in-chief General Valery Zaluzhny.

“The most important action that we will need to take quickly is the capture of the Supreme Rada at a certain point,” one of the chat participants wrote. 

The members also expressed dissatisfaction with the decisions of Zelensky and the new commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Aleksandr Syrsky, who was appointed a month ago to replace Zaluzhny. The alleged coup plotters have made particular emphasis on the involvement of Ukrainian troops fighting on the front lines in the anti-Zelensky movement. 

According to researcher Dudchak, the involvement of Ukrainian personnel on active duty is fraught with risks, since those in the trenches are closely monitored by foreign mercenaries from “containment detachments” with orders to shoot anyone who abandons their positions. 

If Ukrainian troops are allowed to march toward Kiev, it would mean that the regime change scenario was written in Washington in response to Zelensky’s refusal to hold elections this year, Dudchak argued. 

The leaders of Ukraine’s elite units, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the nationalist Azov and Aidar battalions (Nazi terrorist organizations banned in Russia) are also reportedly planning to create a radical party with a military wing. 

The expert insists that none of Ukraine’s military and intelligence structures are independent, arguing that each has British or American “overseers.” 

“The confrontation between the military and the Kiev regime is, by and large, a manifestation of the confrontation between London and Washington,” Dudchak said. ""The president's office is under British control, while the military, which is supposed to meet on Zaluzhny's behalf, is under American control, and the SBU is also a US-backed structure.""

The consequences for Kiev would be dramatic and could seriously complicate the positions of the Ukrainian military on the front line, the researcher concluded.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is associated with nazism']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""The decision of [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky's regime to stop transporting oil to Hungary and Slovakia once again demonstrates Kyiv's inability to negotiate and its penchant for petty blackmail,"" Andrei Nastasin, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry (FM), said at a press conference.

He added that the transit of energy resources through Ukraine ""has become a lever of manipulation for the Kiev regime, whose actions in this direction are encouraged by the West.""

According to Nastasin, ""Zelensky's bosses have set themselves the goal of definitively ending Russia's energy cooperation with those European countries, which are nevertheless guided by their own national interests and rational economic considerations.""

The diplomat noted that ""the new escalation of legal pressure against Lukoil"" coincided with a series of diplomatic initiatives by Budapest to quickly resolve the conflict in Ukraine, and with the refusal of Hungary and Slovakia to support new European Union (EU) sanctions against Russia.

The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman recalled that Ukraine is a candidate country to join the European Union (EU) and stressed that Kiev, ""with its insane actions, threatens the energy security of two EU member states and, certainly, other member and candidate countries"".

Hungary's Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó accused the European Commission on Tuesday of orchestrating the interruption of Russian oil supplies to the bloc via Ukraine, and warned that the dispute could lead to an energy crisis.

In a message on Facebook, Szijjártó harshly criticized the European Union (EU) executive body, saying it had ""done nothing"" since Budapest and Bratislava asked it to intervene in the dispute over the delivery of crude oil.

""Despite the threats to the energy security of two EU member states... Brussels remains silent,"" Szijjártó wrote, adding that the European Commission is either showing too much ""weakness"" in protecting the interests of Slovakia and Hungary, or ""it was Brussels, not Kiev, that invented all this.""

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak assured this Friday that the decision to stop the transit of Russian oil from the Lukoil company through its territory ""has nothing to do with blackmail"", but rather with sanctions from Kyiv.

The statement by Volodymyr Zelensky's adviser, sent to the Reuters news agency, comes after Hungary and Slovakia asked the European Commission to mediate with Ukraine, which included the oil company Lukoil on its sanctions list, causing the end of oil transit to the two countries via the Druzhba pipeline.

On Monday, Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs warned that ""Ukraine's decision not to allow Lukoil to transit oil through Ukraine poses a fundamental threat to the security of energy supplies to Hungary and Slovakia"".

Earlier this Friday, at a press conference, Gergely Gulyas, the head of the Hungarian Prime Minister's office, said that Ukraine was blackmailing Hungary and Slovakia, which ""defend peace and a ceasefire."" However, Podolyak has now assured that ""the situation with the suspension of Russian oil transit through the Druzhba pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia has nothing to do with blackmail in the Ukrainian version,"" Podolyak said in a written comment. ""Hungary and Slovakia do not present themselves as true guardians of peace and do not insist on peace and justice, but only on concessions to Russia,"" he said. It should be noted that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his Slovak counterpart Robert Fico, both described as ""pro-Russian"", have opposed military support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion and advocate a negotiated solution to end the conflict.

According to the FSB note accompanied by a video and published this Friday on its Telegram channel, the individual confessed to having had links with Ukrainian security since February 2023.

Earlier, the FSB reported that Evgeny Serebriakov, involved in the explosion of a car in the north of Moscow on July 24, was deported this Friday to Turkey, where he fled after committing the crime.

Born in 1995, Serebriakov was captured on Thursday in the Turkish city of Bodrum thanks to the interaction of Turkish security forces and Russia, which issued an international search and arrest warrant against him.

During his initial interrogation, the individual said that, on his own initiative, he contacted the administrator of a social media channel “to collaborate with the Ukrainian special services” and that he subsequently established communication with a certain Ilya, an alleged agent of that country’s security service. The two communicated via the instant messaging application Wire, which allows the sending of encrypted messages, and on one occasion met in Istanbul. In the video released by the FSB, Serebriakov revealed that his alleged Ukrainian contact “proposed to eliminate an officer”, for whom he collected components of an explosive device west of Moscow. “On the instructions and under the control of Ilya, I made an explosive device and planted it under a car,” he confessed. On Wednesday, at around 6:00 am (Moscow time), the explosion of a bomb attached to a car injured two people, a man and a woman, in a residential area north of Moscow. Serebriakov managed to escape to Turkey on a commercial flight and arrived in that country as a tourist. On the same day, Russian authorities issued an international search and arrest warrant for the suspect.

A Ukrainian defense source said that several drones attacked the Tuapse refinery, a city on the Black Sea coast in Russia's Krasnodar region (southwest), causing a fire.

""The extent of the damage is being clarified,"" the Ukrainian source said, specifying that it is a refinery owned by Russian giant Rosneft, equipped with a port terminal and that almost 90% of its production is destined for export.

On the social network Telegram, Russian regional authorities said, in turn, that the fire at the refinery was caused by ""drone debris falling.""

""The Kyiv regime has once again attempted to attack civilian infrastructure in Tuapse with drones,"" the Russian sources said.

About a hundred rescue teams were mobilized to the scene and brought the flames under control early this morning, and according to preliminary information, there were no casualties.

In addition, a tractor driver was killed today by a drone and his wife was injured while they were working in an agricultural field near the village of Ustinka in the western Russian region of Belgorod, according to the local governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, who identified the unmanned aircraft as Ukrainian.

The Russian army announced today that it had shot down 80 Ukrainian drones since Sunday night, including 47 in the southern region of Rostov alone, on the border with Ukraine.

According to the source, one drone was destroyed in Belgorod, another in Voronezh, another in Smolensk, eight in Krasnodar and 17 in the Black and Azov Seas.

In a separate statement, the Russian military added that it had destroyed five drones at around 7:00 a.m. (05:00 GMT) over the Astrakan region.

Russia has announced on an almost daily basis that it has destroyed Ukrainian drones launched against its territory.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is systematically strengthening its military potential along Russia's borders, from the Barents Sea to the Black Sea, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said in an interview with the Russian newspaper Argumenty i Fakty.

""Even the term 'eastern side of NATO' has appeared in speeches by the bloc's leaders and documents, including for all Eastern European countries bordering Russia and its allies. Belarus, as well as Romania and, more recently, Sweden and Finland,"" Patrushev said during the conversation on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the creation of the war bloc.

""The alliance's leaders do not hide the fact that the largest military maneuvers near Russia's borders since the collapse of the Soviet Union, 'Steadfast Defender 2024', which are being held in Europe, are aimed precisely at 'containing Russia'. Last year alone, NATO and its member states conducted 130 coalition and more than a thousand national military exercises.

In addition, the secretary added that the plans of the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) include preserving Ukraine, or at least part of it, ""as an anti-Russian territory entirely under their control, completely dedicated to serving the interests of the bloc"".

Patrushev also said that there is irrefutable evidence that Kiev, at the instigation of the US and NATO, after the February 2014 coup in Ukraine, intended to resolve the problem with the ""stubborn"" regions with extreme harshness and force.

'NATO trains mercenaries in several countries'

""NATO instructors are training mercenaries and saboteurs in various countries to participate in anti-Russian operations,"" Patrushev said.

According to the secretary, the war bloc actively participates in organizing shelling of Russian territories and makes decisions on further deliveries of weapons with increased long-range capabilities to Kiev.

""In fact, the Atlantic Alliance is a party to the Ukrainian conflict,"" he said. According to Patrushev, the recent statement by the head of the NATO Military Committee, Rob Bauer, about the bloc's preparation for an open conflict with Moscow is in line with all of its policies.

""In March, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg presented an annual report on the organization's activities over the past year. The entire document focuses on the main task of 'containing' Russia, and in particular China, which means that the Atlantic Alliance did not hesitate to go beyond its geographical mandate and openly declare its global ambitions,"" the head of the Russian Security Council said.

The long-term strategic goals of the United States, the United Kingdom and the ""collective Western countries under their control,"" as Patrushev insisted, are to ""weaken our country as an economic and political competitor and subsequently eliminate it from the political map.""

""For this reason, officials in Brussels have identified our country as the main source of threats to European security and have explicitly enshrined it in NATO's strategic concept,"" the Security Council official concluded.","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

In an interview with Polish radio, a Polish mercenary fighting for Kiev gives a grim account of the situation on the battlefield. Moscow estimates that at least 13,387 foreign mercenaries have enlisted with the Kiev regime, of whom 5,962 have been killed.

At least 20 Polish citizens have been killed while fighting as mercenaries paid by the Kiev regime in the Ukrainian conflict.

The information was given by Piotr Mitkiewicz, a Pole who works as a mercenary for the Ukrainian forces, in an interview with the Morning Talk program on Polish radio station RMF, when asked about the number of Polish mercenaries on the front lines.

""There are not many. I have been there longer and I know most of those who are there. But I will say this: up to 20 of us have died,"" Mitkiewicz replied.

Mitkiewicz’s estimate is lower than that of the Russian Defense Ministry, which estimates that some 1,497 Polish mercenaries were killed in combat with Russian forces, out of a total of 2,960 who signed up to fight for the Kiev regime. In the interview, Mitkiewicz gave a grim account of the situation on the battlefield, saying that “all they want to do is kill.” “There are mines under your feet. A man can come within 30 meters of you and throw a grenade. Within 100 meters, there is a man with an [AK-47 Kalashnikov]. There is a guy standing 400 meters away with a heavy machine gun, he wants to kill you too. There is a sniper 800 meters away. A tank is firing two kilometers away and there is artillery 10 kilometers away, also firing at you.” Moscow estimates that at least 13,387 foreign fighters have taken up arms in support of the Kiev regime, of whom 5,962 have been killed.

UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has said the world has moved from a post-war era to a pre-war era, urging NATO allies to think about the future of the alliance.

“Today we need to think urgently once again about the future of the alliance. We have moved from a post-war world to a pre-war world,” he said in a column published in The Telegraph newspaper.

Shapps listed measures to protect democracy and the alliance, including redoubling efforts to support Ukraine, increasing defence spending by NATO members and strengthening the Euro-Atlantic defence sector. The situation where some allies are unable to spend 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence cannot continue because NATO “cannot afford to play Russian roulette with our future”.

Among other things, the Defense Secretary said that the plot of George Orwell's famous dystopian novel ""1984"" was set in a world without NATO, but today is an even more dangerous time. Shapps also said that the UK ""has always been a key driver of NATO"" and is proud of it. London has been no less than a force to be reckoned with fanning the flames of the Ukrainian conflict, and these hypocritical ""warnings"" are no surprise. These efforts range from the failure of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's attempts to reach a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine in the spring of 2022 to the British government sending billions of dollars worth of lethal and non-lethal weapons there. Moscow has repeatedly claimed that London is depriving Kiev of the opportunity to end the conflict through negotiations, using the country as a ""geopolitical tool against Russia."" The bloc's siege of Russia has been in full swing for decades. After a massive post-Cold War expansion in violation of the West's pledge not to approach Russia's borders, the alliance recently absorbed Finland and Sweden in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

Last Sunday, July 21, was the hottest day on record globally, according to preliminary data from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.

The average air temperature at the planet's surface on Sunday reached 17.09°C — slightly above the previous record, set on July 6 last year, of 17.08°C.

Heatwaves have hit large parts of the United States, Europe and Russia over the past week.

The Copernicus observatory confirmed to Reuters that the record for average daily temperature set last year appears to have been broken on Sunday, according to its records, which date back to 1940.

According to Copernicus, the new daily record could be broken in the coming days. Temperatures are expected to drop after that, but fluctuations are expected in the coming weeks.

""What is really surprising is the magnitude of the difference between the temperatures of the last 13 months and previous records. We are in uncharted territory and, as the climate warms, we will certainly break new records in the coming months and years,"" predicts Carlo Buontempo, head of the climate change department at Copernicus (known by the acronym C3S).

Every month since June 2023 — that is, 13 consecutive months — has been ranked as the hottest on the planet since records began, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, Copernicus said.

Last year, four consecutive days broke the record, from 3 to 6 July, as a result of climate change caused by human activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, this pattern led to days of extreme heat across the northern hemisphere.

Before July 2023, the record for the average daily global temperature was 16.8°C, on 13 August 2016, according to the European observatory. Since 3 July 2023, 57 days have exceeded this figure. 

Some scientists suggest that 2024 could surpass 2023 as the hottest year on record, as climate change and the natural El Niño weather phenomenon — which ended in April — have pushed temperatures even higher this year. 

The Copernicus observatory, however, is cautious about commenting on this possibility. ""For now, 2024 is warm enough for the whole year"" to break the record, the European service said, ""but the exceptional heat recorded in the last four months of 2023 makes it too early [to predict].""",['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Kremlin said on Friday it welcomed comments by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that Russia is a ""war machine"" that defeated Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler, but said he was not wearing rose-tinted glasses when it came to the Republican candidate.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was responding to a question about comments Trump said he made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 19 phone call.

Trump later told Fox News that he had told Zelenskiy the war had to end.

""This is a war machine that you're up against. That's what they (the Russians) do, they fight wars. They beat Hitler. They beat Napoleon. We have to end this war,"" Trump said.

Commenting on Trump’s remarks, Peskov said: “It will probably be useful for most of the American public to know that there are many glorious pages in Russian history, and in fact, probably few people in the US, that is, ordinary Americans and perhaps representatives of the so-called political establishment, know history so deeply.” But Peskov, when asked later about a Wall Street Journal commentary co-authored by Mike Pompeo, Trump’s former secretary of state, said the Kremlin had its eyes wide open when it came to assessing what a Trump presidency could mean for Russia. Pompeo’s comment suggested that Trump would impose tough new sanctions on Moscow if elected and increase aid to Ukraine. “We have never and do not wear rose-colored glasses. (Trump) is a representative of the US political elite, which is now absolutely suffering from the all-out anti-Russian sentiment,” Peskov said.

""This is a difficult issue. From a legal point of view, it is a problem, but from a practical point of view, we are open to achieving our goals through negotiations. Therefore, several options are possible,"" the presidential spokesman said.

Zelensky's legitimacy as president of Ukraine has been a question raised by Russia, which argues that the Ukrainian leader's term ended on May 20.

The Russian spokesman said that in addition to ""problems with Zelensky's legitimacy"", there is also ""the problem of the ban on establishing any contacts or negotiations with the Russian side, since this ban remains in force"".

""Therefore, there is still a lot to clarify and we need to hear some explanations,"" Peskov said.

Following Zelensky’s recent statements about his readiness to negotiate a peaceful solution to the war in Ukraine, the Russian presidential spokesman stressed that “Russia is generally open to the negotiation process, but it is necessary to understand to what extent the Ukrainian side is prepared.”

“So far, as you can see, we have heard very different statements, so far things are not very clear,” he added.

On Wednesday, Peskov recalled that Russian President Vladimir Putin had stated that “Zelensky has lost legitimacy” after the end of his term, which “is a factor that can significantly hinder the peace process.”

The spokesman also stressed that Russia will ensure the defence of its interests and security in any case, whether through negotiations or weapons.

“The special military operation was launched as a last resort to achieve our goals,” Peskov said, stressing that “any war ends with peace negotiations.”

In recent days, Zelensky has stressed the need for negotiations to end the war as soon as possible.

The Ukrainian president has recently held talks with political representatives in favour of an immediate ceasefire, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba travelled to China this week to discuss potential peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.

Ukraine has been relying on financial and arms aid from Western allies since Russia invaded the country on 24 February 2022.

The Republican convention here in Milwaukee brings together party officials and delegates from all US states and territories. Few of them are from the poorest sectors of the population. They are mostly white men in suits and Trumpist caps. There was little diversity in the audience. The atmosphere was festive. I did not witness any hostility. Many of the issues raised are legitimate. But the radicalism at other times of people with that friendly smile of ""Nice to meet you"" is frightening.

In his speech, Donald Trump once again used a slogan that has become famous in the current campaign. ""Drill baby, drill!"" they shouted. This phrase in English indicates that oil prospecting should be one of the Republican's priorities if he wins the election, ignoring warnings about the risks of using this polluting energy at a time of worsening climate change.

Immigration is another point that draws attention when Trump uses terms like “invasion” to describe the migratory movement into the US from the border with Mexico. Immigrants, who include many families with children, are classified as criminals by the former president. His voters cheer, shouting “build the wall” and displaying signs that say “mass deportation”. 

Weapons are also a strong topic among Trump supporters. At the convention, there were a number of t-shirts with slogans about the right to own and carry weapons. An irony, since weapons are prohibited at the convention, except in the hands of the police and the secret service. More seriously, Trump was almost killed by a 20-year-old who had access to an AR15 rifle and still did not change his mind.

Slovak Defence Minister Robert Kalinak rejects the idea of ​​sending troops to Ukraine, saying there is a ""red line"" that must not be crossed.

In an interview with Ta3 News, Kalinak said that Western politicians are exploiting the conflict and the suffering of Ukrainians to achieve their own goals.

The possibility of sending troops to Ukraine was recently raised by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said that the ""option"" could not be ruled out.

Macron's comments, however, triggered a wave of denials from high-ranking government representatives of NATO member countries, including the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Germany, Finland and Sweden.

The Slovak Defence Minister warned that sending soldiers from the bloc to Ukraine ""would significantly increase the risk of a global conflict"". Kalinak added that those “who are serious about supporting Ukraine” should call on “healthy Ukrainians” to return home. He also called for an end to hostilities between Kiev and Moscow and said a non-violent solution was needed. The world is already witnessing the consequences of the conflict “down to the last Ukrainian,” the minister said, stressing that “it is time for [the world] to seek peaceful solutions.” Russia has repeatedly stated that it is ready for talks as long as the situation on the ground is on the agenda.

Russia considers the US position on the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack to be clearly biased, Washington is trying to defend Ukraine, Maria Zakharova, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told Sputnik.

Earlier, the head of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) Aleksandr Bortnikov said that preliminary data on those arrested in the case of the Crocus City Hall terrorist attack confirmed the Ukrainian trail, and that the security services will continue to work on the information.

""They exposed themselves. They [the US] started shouting, not calling for an investigation, and started shielding Ukraine from the blow. Their involvement and involvement in this story is obvious,"" Zakharova said.

According to the diplomat, in the absence of Kiev's involvement, Washington's first statements should have been about the need for an investigation and presentation of facts.

It is worth noting that shortly after the attack on Friday (22), the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, John Kirby, said that there was no evidence that Ukraine or Ukrainians were involved in the attack in Moscow. The US has subsequently repeatedly stated that there was no ""Ukrainian trail"" in the case. In particular, the US State Department stated that ""there was no Ukrainian involvement in the attack on Crocus City Hall, period."" In response, Maria Zakharova expressed doubts that the Washington authorities would draw ""conclusions about anyone's involvement in the midst of a tragedy."" The attack on Crocus City Hall, located in the city of Krasnogorsk, on the outskirts of Moscow, occurred on Friday night (22), when a large number of people were preparing to attend a concert by the Russian rock band Picnic.

555,PT_28.txt,"West would condone ‘virtually any crime’ Ukraine committed, military analyst argues

One example is the silence on Ukraine’s illegal use of anti-personnel mines, which were banned by the 1999 Mine Ban Treaty. The military equipment that became common during World War II was designed to kill or injure several people who were near the devices after they exploded.

The West would likely condone any crime committed by the Kiev regime against Russia, argued Boris Rozhin, a military expert at the Center for Military-Political Journalism.

In one example, Rozhin pointed to the illegal use of anti-personnel mines by President Vladimir Zelensky’s government. The 1999 Ottawa Treaty, or simply the Mine Ban Treaty, was ratified by Ukraine at the time and prohibits signatory countries from using anti-personnel landmines.

Since the beginning of the Russian special military operation, Ukraine has been using the equipment in its combat operations, including against the civilian population in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). However, there has been no reaction from Western politicians.

""So any crime that Ukraine might commit, all of them would be approved,"" Rozhin said, adding that outrageous acts that the West could not openly approve would be ""contained at the media level.""

""There is no reason to believe that the West would in any way condemn or protest against such use [of landmines] by Ukraine. On the contrary, the West supplies [Kiev] with the same type of anti-personnel mines that are being used against civilians, and this is approved by the Western leadership,"" he condemned.

As for Washington's turning a blind eye to its allies' use of weapons prohibited by international treaties, such as Israel's use of white phosphorus munitions, Rozhin explained that ""essentially none of the international treaties work today.""

According to the analyst, Western powers choose to abide by treaties that they consider advantageous at the moment, while those deemed disadvantageous to their interests are used to accuse Russia of one or another crime.

The conventions in question are not subject to independent monitoring, while international organizations are used by the West for propaganda purposes.

""That said, when it comes to the use of certain prohibited munitions, such as cluster munitions, accusing Ukraine of this is laughable,"" Rozhin said. According to the expert, ""the United States, in particular, has supplied Ukraine with a large quantity of cluster munitions that are being used by Kiev both in combat and against civilians, so there is no reason to expect any reaction.""","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia will consider any US troops sent to Ukraine as interventionists.

The remarks were made during an interview with Dmitry Kiselev, CEO of the Rossiya Segodnya media group, which Sputnik is part of.

Putin responded to the announcement that the US would not send troops to Ukraine, saying that Russia would not underestimate the seriousness of such an action.

""We know what US troops are on Russian territory, they are intervention troops, and that is how we will treat them, even if they appear on Ukrainian territory,"" the Russian president said.

Putin stressed that Washington understands Russia's position on the issue. Tensions between Russia and the West have been rising since 2014, and the US and its NATO allies have supported Kiev.

Putin, in the interview, also did not rule out the possibility of Russia conducting nuclear tests if the US does so. ""If they conduct such tests, I do not exclude it, it is not mandatory, if we need it, we do not need it, we still have to think about it, but I do not exclude that we could do the same."" He specified that Russian forces are prepared for a nuclear war: ""From a military point of view, of course we are ready. Our forces are constantly on alert."" ""I said that [US President Joe] Biden is a representative of the traditional political school, and this is being confirmed. There, besides Biden, there are many other experts in Russian-American relations and deterrence strategy. Therefore, I do not believe that everything is heading directly towards this, but we are ready."" He stressed that there is a treaty that prohibits such tests. The Americans have not ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), and Russia has withdrawn its ratification in order to maintain parity, the Russian president recalled.

""Since the treaty has not been ratified by the United States, it has not entered into legal force, because it has not received the required number of ratifications. However, we are still observing these agreements,"" Putin said.

However, he added that the possibility of conducting such tests is being considered in the United States. ""This is due to the fact that when new warheads appear, some experts believe that it is not enough to test them only on the computer, they need to be tested in real conditions.""

""Such ideas are circulating in certain groups in the United States. We know about this. And we are also observing it,"" the Russian president said.

The multilateral treaty was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (UN) on September 10, 1996, with the aim of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its forms.

Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Nicolás Maduro on his victory in Venezuela's election on Monday, and the Kremlin said it was deepening cooperation in all areas - including sensitive ones - with Caracas.

Maduro and his opposition rival Edmundo Gonzalez both claimed victory in the presidential election, with Washington and some other foreign governments casting doubt on the official results that gave the incumbent victory.

The national election authority said Maduro had won a third term with 51% of the vote.

Putin has backed Maduro, 61, an ally who accuses the United States and the West of fueling the war in Ukraine, saying Moscow enjoys a strategic partnership with the South American country and that Maduro is always welcome in Russia.

""Russian-Venezuelan relations have the character of a strategic partnership,"" Putin said in a message to Maduro, according to the Kremlin. ""I am confident that your activities as head of state will continue to contribute to its progressive development in all directions.""

""This fully serves the interests of our friendly peoples and is in line with the construction of a more just and democratic world order,"" Putin said. ""I would like to confirm our willingness to continue our constructive joint work on current issues on the bilateral and international agenda.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had serious concerns that the results announced by the electoral authority did not reflect the people's votes. The authority is supposed to be an independent body, but the opposition says it acts as an arm of the Maduro government.

But Moscow sees Venezuela as an important partner in Latin America, and the two sanctioned states have cooperated over the past two decades in areas including oil, weapons and military exercises.

The Russian military offensive on Ukrainian territory, launched on 24 February 2022, has plunged Europe into what is considered the most serious security crisis since the Second World War (1939-1945).

Ukraine has been relying on financial and weapons aid from its Western allies, who have also imposed sanctions on key sectors of the Russian economy in an attempt to reduce Moscow's ability to finance the war effort.

The past few months have been marked by large-scale Russian airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, while Kiev's forces have targeted targets in Russian territory close to the border and on the Crimean peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014.

A month after the start of summer in the northern hemisphere, the world recorded the hottest day in history last Sunday, July 21, according to preliminary data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, linked to the European Union.

The global average air temperature on that Sunday reached 17.09 °C – slightly above the previous record, set in July last year, of 17.08 °C.

It may not seem like much, but the rise in temperatures is part of a dangerous trend over the last 13 months, in which each consecutive month has broken its respective records compared to the same month in previous years.

In the northern summer, heatwaves have already begun to hit large areas of the United States, Western Europe – especially in the Mediterranean region – and Russia last week.

Last year, four consecutive days broke this record, from July 3 to 6. This is the direct result of the effects of climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, which has caused increasingly extreme heatwaves and progressively higher temperatures across the planet.

Established in Portugal in 1998, this day draws attention to the preservation of natural heritage, which is essential for people's well-being and the sustainability of economies.

Prepared by the North American management consultancy firm Oliver Wyman, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum (WEF), the study ""Assessing the impact of climate change on human health"" analyses the consequences resulting from the gradual increase in the planet's average temperature on public health.

""Floods represent the greatest risk of mortality, with an estimated 8.5 million deaths by 2050, followed by droughts (3.2 million) and heat waves (1.6 million),"" says a press release announcing the report, which estimates that ""the total costs for health systems to treat diseases caused by climate change will exceed one billion euros"" in the same year.

In addition, the study analyses the negative health effects of tropical storms, forest fires and rising sea levels, indicating that nearly 70% of these deaths will occur in high-risk regions, especially in Southeast Asia.

Asia is the region where the impact of climate change on health is expected to be greatest, with ""economic losses of around 3.2 trillion euros"" being calculated.

In terms of economic losses, it is followed by Europe (2.3 trillion), South America (1.9 trillion) and Africa (1.8 trillion euros).

Due to the lack of resources and essential medical equipment, as well as inadequate infrastructure, the African continent ""is in a position of greater vulnerability to the impacts of climate change on health than other regions"".

The study by the strategic consultancy Marsh McLennan Group ""presents emission reduction strategies to avoid economic losses of up to 11.5 trillion euros by 2050"", considering that the role of the private sector is crucial and ""should be encouraged by governments"".

In terms of direct economic incentives, measures such as ""tax credits, subsidies or research grants to support initiatives that aim to mitigate the impacts of climate change"" are mentioned, and the creation of regulations ""that stimulate innovation"" is also proposed.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree on Wednesday on the new Maritime Security Strategy, which envisages ""changes and innovations"", especially in the Black Sea, and which is accompanied by a strategy with international partners.

The Kremlin (Russian presidency) spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, commenting on the Ukrainian initiative, warned that Moscow will take measures to ensure the country's security due to the ""additional threats"" posed by the presence of NATO ships in the area.

""The concentrated presence of NATO ships - and we take into account Bulgaria and Romania, which are NATO littoral states - poses additional threats to Russia, especially in the current situation,"" he said.

Peskov referred, in particular, to the ""direct involvement of NATO countries in the conflict over Ukraine"", according to the Spanish news agency EFE.

""Of course, Russia will take all necessary measures to ensure its own security,"" he said.

Peskov also recalled that ""the presence of non-Black Sea states"" in those waters ""is regulated very strictly by the Montreux Convention"".

""Turkey is, in this case, the administrator and performs its functions very clearly"", he added, quoted by the Spanish agency Europa Press.

Dated 1936, the Montreux Convention gives Turkey control of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits that connect the Black and Mediterranean Seas.

Merchant ships enjoy freedom of passage, but warships are subject to restrictions ""that vary depending on whether or not these ships belong to the Black Sea states"", according to the Turkish government.

The representative of Crimea in the Russian parliament, Mikhail Sheremet, also accused Zelenskyy today of wanting to prolong the conflict with Russia, according to the Russian agency TASS.

Sheremet said that Kiev's new maritime security strategy is aimed at building up Ukrainian naval forces and ensuring the presence of North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in the Black Sea. According to the Crimean MP, if Ukraine's military pressure weakens, Zelensky will no longer be needed by the West and NATO countries will stop supporting him as Ukrainian leader. Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and, since the February 2022 invasion, has added the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia to the list.","['URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Kremlin signaled on Thursday that it is open to negotiations with Ukraine to end the conflict while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy remains in power, despite publicly questioning his legitimacy to rule.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Wednesday during a visit to China that Kiev was prepared to hold talks with Russia as long as Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity were fully respected, though he said Ukraine saw no sign of that.

The Kremlin, while signaling its readiness for talks on its own terms, has publicly questioned Zelenskiy’s mandate to rule, noting that his five-year term expired in May and that he should have called an election.

Zelenskiy and the West argue that normal political rules must be suspended in wartime and that the Kremlin, given Russia’s tightly controlled political system, is in no position to criticize.

When asked on Thursday whether Russia would be ready to hold talks with Ukraine while Zelenskiy was in power, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters:

“Russia is generally open to a negotiation process. But first we need to understand how ready the Ukrainian side is for this and how much the Ukrainian side is allowed to do this by its handlers.”

Moscow describes Zelenskiy as a puppet of the United States, a characterization it rejects.

""Because so far we see very different statements being made, and this is still not very clear. Also, in addition to the problem with Zelenskiy's legitimacy, there is also a problem with the (Ukrainian) legal ban on having any contacts and negotiations with the Russian side. So there is still a lot to be clarified and clarifications to be heard,"" Peskov said.

Pressed during a conference call whether the Kremlin would consider the possibility of negotiating with Zelenskiy or whether it categorically ruled out such a possibility, Peskov said:

""The question is not easy. From a legal point of view, this problem (of his legitimacy) is on the agenda, but from a practical point of view, we are open to achieving our goals through negotiations. So different options are possible here.""

Reuters reported in May that Putin was ready to end the war in Ukraine with a negotiated ceasefire, but the Kremlin chief was prepared to continue fighting if Kiev and the West did not respond.

In June, Putin said Russia would end the war in Ukraine, what he calls a special military operation, only if Kiev agreed to abandon its NATO ambitions and hand over four provinces claimed by Moscow, demands Kiev quickly rejected as tantamount to surrender.","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

“For the liberation of Palestine from the clutches of the Zionist state, for the end of genocide and for the end of fossil fuels.”

The pinnacle of useful idiocy. Historically, young people have always been pawns of certain ideological elites. Social movements are almost always inorganic, almost always artificial, created in universities and then amplified by the “owners” of the narratives and by the holders of the dominant instruments in the communication system, in this case the media.

It is no coincidence that social networks are completely attacked in every way, precisely because of this. What social networks came to do was to take away the monopoly of narratives from the owners of the communication system.

What is the main objective of these social movements?

The main or only objective, regardless of whether the activists are aware of it or not, some will be aware, others have no idea at all – they believe they are defending very important causes. But the main objective is the destruction of the infrastructure of Western society, or in Marxist terms, of “bourgeois capitalist” society.

They use numerous tools: the LGBT movement, instrumentalized to destroy the traditional family, which is the basis of any healthy and civilized society and is the basis of Western civilization. “Climate madness”, which aims to take away people’s freedoms. The end of fossil fuels, which is linked to climate change, ultimately aims to destroy the energy basis of the bourgeois capitalist model.

Regarding this action at the Faculty of Psychology – anti-Zionism. Zionism is a nationalist political movement. That is the problem. Communism is one of the globalist currents and is intrinsically internationalist, the Nation is to be destroyed and, therefore, the Zionist State of Israel is a problem (Jewish anti-nationalism).

All these instruments contribute to the destruction of the pillars that support the edifice of Western civilization, and the goal is to destroy them so that the way is paved for the end of the market economy. This makes it easier to pave the way for communist totalitarianism, which uses new instruments other than the orthodox or original class struggle – proletariat versus bosses.

The Nation is the “nemesis” of the globalists, and cultural Marxism is the new communism today, being one of the globalist movements we have at the moment, in addition to the liberal globalism led by the USA.

In short, this is useful idiocy, it is simply a copy of the inorganic social movements that arise in American universities and are then imported to Portugal, with the sole aim of destroying the foundations of Western civilization and diluting the Nations from within.",['CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups'],['CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
564,PT_15.txt,"Western media instructed not to talk about victims of attack near Moscow, Russia says

The Russian Foreign Ministry has condemned what it said was an attempt by the West to cover up its role and demonize the Russian government following the tragedy at the concert hall.

Western media outlets have been instructed to keep quiet about the number of victims of the terrorist attack at Crocus City Hall, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday (8).

""Particularly cynical are the attempts by the West to distract the international community from the real organizers and beneficiaries by categorically instructing them not to cover the true scale of the tragedy in the media: not to mention the number of victims of the terrorist attack, the number of dead children, or to show the reaction of ordinary citizens to what happened,"" the ministry said on its Telegram channel.

The foreign ministry explained this by a desire not to show sympathy and humanism towards the Russians.

The ministry added that immediately after the attack, Western media and authorities organised a PR campaign to deny the involvement of Ukrainian security services.

The media were instructed to spread the story that Daesh (a terrorist organisation banned in Russia and several other countries) was involved in organising the attack; they were instructed to deny the Islamists’ links to Kiev and Western secret services, as well as to discredit the results of the investigation and promote the theory that “Russian secret services were involved”.

On 22 March, several armed men stormed the Crocus City Hall concert hall and started shooting at people. The terrorists also set fire to the venue. The attack left 144 people dead, according to the latest figures from the Ministry of Emergency Situations.

The four main suspects in the case – all citizens of Tajikistan – tried to flee the scene by car, but were detained near the Russian border and charged with terrorism.

Russian authorities believe the suspects planned to flee to Ukraine, where the attack's organizers had a safe haven for them. An investigation into the case is ongoing.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, said this Saturday (2) that the sending of military personnel from the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to Ukraine could precipitate a global apocalypse.

In a video posted on social media, he highlighted Ukraine's inability to resolve the conflict, despite the substantial financial and military aid provided by the West.

He stressed that, although the military presence of the EU and NATO could potentially change the dynamics of the conflict, it could also trigger catastrophic consequences. ""The West sees that, despite significant financial and military aid, Ukraine is incapable of resolving this armed conflict"".

""The situation could change with the arrival of EU and NATO military personnel to Ukraine, but then there would be nothing left but to wait for the arrival of the global apocalypse"", said the Slovak Prime Minister.

Fico stressed the pressing need for modern air defence systems for Ukraine, but warned that the West cannot provide these systems without a commitment to maintain and operate them. He also argued that sending Western troops would only exacerbate the conflict rather than resolve it. Russia has been continuing its special military operation in Ukraine since February 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin has justified the action as a measure to protect the population against “genocide” by the Kiev regime and to contain NATO’s eastward advance. Moscow has repeatedly warned against Western arms supplies to Kiev, saying that foreign convoys carrying weapons would be legitimate targets for its forces once they crossed the border. In addition, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the United States and NATO of already being directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine, not only through the supply of weapons, but also through the training of personnel in several European countries.","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

Russia held secret meetings with the US to try to end the war in Ukraine.

Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s Foreign Minister, confirmed that a group of Russian political scientists and experts met with American experts.

“We had never-disclosed contacts with Americans, through political scientists who knew and understood the governments’ policies,” Lavrov announced on the sidelines of the United Nations Security Council.

The statement was quoted this Thursday by Folha de S. Paulo, the newspaper that reported on these attempts at a peace agreement in March.

The meetings served as a sort of screening of what was acceptable to both countries – but Ukraine never had representatives at these meetings.

The governments of Russia and the US authorized these meetings, even though they were not official.

The negotiations lasted just over a year, but according to the Russian minister, they did not produce the desired result. In practice, they were of no use.

Sergei Lavrov only shared one more topic addressed in these meetings: the status of ethnic Russians within Ukraine.

It should be remembered that Russian President Vladimir Putin had said before the war that Russian culture was being pushed aside in Ukraine, for example with the law limiting the use of the Russian language in the Ukrainian education system.

Until now, there have only been official meetings between Russians and Ukrainians at the very beginning of the war.

Citing sources close to the Kremlin, the Bloomberg news agency had reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to understand whether Washington was in favour of starting talks on ending the war in Ukraine.

Russia denied this Friday that President Vladimir Putin had expressed any willingness to the United States to negotiate Ukraine's entry into NATO in exchange for Russian control over the territories annexed in the neighbouring country.

""This information is wrong and does not coincide at all with reality"", said the spokesman for the Russian Presidency (Kremlin), Dmitri Peskov, at the usual daily press conference.

Previously, and citing sources close to the Kremlin, the Bloomberg news agency had reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to understand whether Washington was in favour of starting talks on ending the war in Ukraine.

According to two sources cited by Bloomberg, the Russian leader had sent signals to the United States of America (USA) about a possible willingness by Moscow to engage in dialogue.

According to the news agency, the Kremlin leader may be willing to consider Ukraine's eventual accession to the Atlantic Alliance, provided that Kiev accepts the new ""territorial realities"", referring to the Ukrainian regions annexed by Moscow. 

Until now, Ukraine has always opposed making territorial concessions to Moscow or freezing the conflict because, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, this would only benefit Moscow. 

Russia wants international assessment of military plane downing 

The Kremlin also criticized Western countries for not condemning the downing of the Russian Il-76 military transport plane, which was carrying Ukrainian prisoners and which Moscow said was Ukraine's responsibility, during Thursday's meeting of the United Nations Security Council. 

""So far, there has been no categorical condemnation from Western countries of this horrific terrorist attack. We have not heard a single word of condemnation,"" Peskov said. 

According to the Kremlin spokesman, ""this event requires a proper assessment by the international community"", since, he claimed, ""this is not the first time that Kiev has killed its own people"".

Asked about the Russian presidency's willingness to present evidence to the UN or other international organisations that Ukraine was involved in the downing of the plane or that the Ukrainian authorities knew who was travelling on board the aircraft, Peskov replied only that, at this time, he had ""nothing to add"".

""Investigators are working and decisions will be made as they obtain all the necessary information"", he added.

According to the Russian version, the Il-76 military transport plane was shot down on Wednesday by Ukraine with 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war on board, as well as six crew members and three Russian guards, which was allegedly travelling to Ukraine for a prisoner exchange.

For its part, Ukraine, which confirmed that an exchange was being prepared, claims that the plane was carrying weapons and not prisoners of war.

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Ukraine joining NATO would be a declaration of war against Moscow and that only “prudence” on behalf of the alliance could prevent the planet from being torn apart.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders pledged at their summit last week to support Ukraine on an “irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,” but left open the question of when that membership might happen.

Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council and a leading voice among Kremlin hawks, told the Argumenty I Fakty media outlet that Ukraine’s accession would go beyond a direct threat to Moscow’s security.

“This would essentially be a declaration of war – albeit a belated one,” he said in comments published on Wednesday.

“The actions that Russia’s opponents have been taking against us for years, expanding the alliance, are bringing NATO to a point of no return.”

In a standard Kremlin line since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Medvedev said Russia was not threatening NATO but would respond to the alliance’s attempts to advance its interests.

“The more such attempts there are, the harsher our responses will become,” Medvedev said. “Whether this will tear the entire planet apart depends solely on the prudence of the (NATO) side.”","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Under the slogan ""One Earth - One Family - One Future"", they will debate, in a tense atmosphere, the deep differences over Russia's war in Ukraine, debt restructuring and the phasing out of fossil fuels, which will make it difficult to reach a joint declaration on Sunday.

Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak, Emmanuel Macron and other G20 leaders will be in New Delhi for the 18th Group of 20 Summit.

Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will not be present, leaving national representation to Li Qiang, the Chinese prime minister, who will lead the Chinese delegation, and Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, who will lead the Russian delegation.

Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, the host country for the annual summit, hopes to assert his country’s growing diplomatic clout and facilitate dialogue on the issues that divide the G20: Russia’s war in Ukraine and climate change.

The lack of consensus on the war in Ukraine threatens to derail the summit, undermining progress on issues such as food security, debt restructuring and cooperation on climate change.

“The cost of inaction will be catastrophic”

The G20 Summit is taking place as “the world is on a knife-edge. The climate crisis is inflicting immense harm on people, and the human rights of billions of people are under threat,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general, in a statement this week.

According to Amnesty International, “it is vital that the G20 recognises the magnitude and urgency of these crises and acts quickly to prevent the escalation of climate disasters and debt”, otherwise “the cost of inaction will be catastrophic”, she added.

At the previous G20 summit in November 2022, hosted by the Indonesian G20 presidency in Bali, leaders discussed the impact of Russia’s war on Ukraine on the global economy, and in particular food and energy security.

Despite issuing a joint declaration, Amnesty International believes that it has not been honoured so far and calls for its implementation and the adoption of new commitments.

This G20 summit comes ahead of other key occasions when countries will be meeting again, such as the UN General Assembly’s High-Level Week and the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Ambition Summit later this month, both in New York, as well as the COP28 climate meeting in Dubai, which starts on 30 November.",['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For years, experts have been warning humanity about the impact of global warming: as temperatures rise, there is concern about the world’s food supply, rising sea levels and the fact that parts of the Earth will become too hot to live in.

Now, in a study published in the journal ‘Nature Geoscience’, scientists have predicted when humanity will witness the “triple extinction” that will wipe out human beings and what will cause it.

The study, led by the University of Bristol (UK), suggests that the Earth could become a hot, dry and largely uninhabitable supercontinent, with the entire land mass merging into one giant landmass – using the first supercomputer climate models of the distant future, it showed that the world will experience more volcanic eruptions that will emit huge plumes of carbon dioxide, further increasing temperatures.

The Sun could become hotter and brighter in the sky, warming the Earth more than ever before and causing average temperatures to reach between 40 and 50 degrees Celsius.

According to Alexandre Farnsworth, lead author of the study and senior research associate at the University of Bristol, “the newly emerged supercontinent would effectively create a triple whammy, comprising the effect of continentality, a hotter Sun and more CO2 in the atmosphere, increasing heat across much of the planet”.

The result is a hostile environment, with no food or water sources for mammals. Widespread temperatures of 40 to 50 degrees Celsius and even greater daily extremes, compounded by high humidity, would ultimately seal our fate. Humans — along with many other species — would die out due to their inability to release this heat through sweat, thereby cooling their bodies. According to the study, even if humanity were to stop using fossil fuels, it would not prevent extinction. Even if humanity survives until the event, there will be a total extinction. The only advantage is that the event is 250 million years away. Eunice Lo, a co-author of the study and a researcher in Climate Change and Health at the University of Bristol, said: “It is vitally important not to lose sight of our current climate crisis, which is a result of human emissions of greenhouse gases. Although we are predicting an uninhabitable planet within 250 million years, we are already experiencing extreme heat that is damaging to human health. This is why it is crucial to achieve net zero emissions as soon as possible,” he concluded.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Whatever we do it is already too late']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

President Lula spoke about the flooding that hit several regions of Rio Grande do Sul between Monday and Tuesday. On the program ""Conversa com o Presidente"", he spoke about the situation in the municipalities of Serra and the North of the state and guaranteed federal aid.

""Now, we have excessive rain. It rained a lot in several regions, there are floods and from what I saw, there are deaths.

Lula recalled that, in the first half of the year, a delegation of ministers visited the state to assess the losses caused by the drought that affected 400 municipalities and impacted agricultural production. In February, the federal government released 392.8 million euros for mitigation actions. In March, 12 cities in Rio Grande do Sul affected by drought received aid of over 360 million euros.

For the president, these extreme events are a warning that the climate issue is not a minor issue. “It is not a question of university professors, it is not a question of environmentalists, it is a question of humanity, of the planet suffering the consequences of human irresponsibility,” he said, reaffirming that he has a plan to include the topic of climate change in the school curriculum.

There are millions of fungi in the world. Although 150,000 have been catalogued, scientists believe that the real number may vary between 1 and 5 million different species. However, a minority of them present a risk of infection.

The group of researchers investigated 98 infections caused by fungi between 2009 and 2019, registered in Chinese hospitals. They claim to have discovered a new species causing infections. “We identified two independent cases of human infection by a previously undescribed invasive fungal pathogen,” the study reads. Rhodosporidiobolus fluvialis was the species identified.

In general, high body temperature prevents fungi from surviving. The researchers then carried out laboratory tests on mice that were induced to a body temperature of 37ºC and discovered that this species of fungus not only remained alive, but also registered an increase in mutation rates, compared to milder temperatures.

As a result of the accelerated mutation, the fungi can become even more resistant to drugs, which would make it more difficult to treat any potential disease. “Temperature-induced mutagenesis can also trigger the development of pan-resistance to three of the most widely used antifungals (fluconazole, caspofungin and amphotericin B),” the researchers say.

The group also presented the theory that the increase in global temperature, as a consequence of the climate crisis, could favour the proliferation of infectious diseases. “Global warming can promote the evolution of new fungal pathogens,” the article states.

On the other hand, Toni Gabaldón, a biologist at the Institute for Biomedical Research in Barcelona, ​​says that caution is needed. “Direct evidence that these two observations are related is lacking and further research is needed,” he told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.",['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
573,PT_191.txt,"Southern Region has 7 out of 10 cyclone alerts in Brazil in the last ten years

Submerged houses in Lajeado (RS) this Wednesday (6) after a cyclone passed through.

Recently affected by the formation of an extratropical cyclone in Rio Grande do Sul that killed more than 40 people, the southern region of the country registered 71 of the 92 alerts issued to the federal government in the last ten years due to this natural phenomenon.

G1 analyzed data from the Integrated Disaster Information System, which receives daily alerts from Brazilian municipalities about the effects of natural phenomena. The system is linked to the Ministry of Integration and Regional Development.

The South represents 77% of the alerts, due to the state of Santa Catarina, which registered 64 occurrences between January 2013 and August 2023. In the same period, five occurrences were registered in Rio Grande do Sul and two in Paraná.

The city with the most cyclones was Balneário Barra do Sul (SC), with 13 episodes. See below a map with all the municipalities that issued a cyclone alert to the federal government in the last decade.

Why in the South?

Climatempo meteorologist Fábio Luengo explains that the southern states are historically more affected by extratropical cyclones due to their location in an area where air masses meet.

""It is a region that has a greater thermal contrast between the hot and humid air (coming from the North) and the cold air that comes from the South [of the planet]"", he explains.

What is not common, says Luengo, is the intensity and frequency that these natural phenomena have gained. This week's extratropical cyclone, for example, marked the greatest natural tragedy in the history of Rio Grande do Sul.

He mentions three factors that explain this increase in extreme weather events.

- Climate change, caused by human action on the planet, which increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events;

- Warming of the Atlantic Ocean, a process that is also more intense and frequent due to climate change;

- The action of the climatic phenomenon known as ""El Niño"", which, among other effects, causes excessive rainfall in the south of the country and in the southeast of the country.",['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
574,PT_185.txt,"Tragedy in RS highlights the urgency of mitigating climate change

A new storm is hitting Rio Grande do Sul, with unprecedented amounts of precipitation. In two days, it rained more than three times the average for the month of May. The frequency of meteorological disasters requires authorities to change the way they deal with them.

This is the fifth climate disaster to hit the people of Rio Grande do Sul in less than a year. In June 2023, a cyclone swept through the state; from July to December, storms affected the lives of millions of people.

The state government has now once again declared a state of public calamity. As of Friday morning (3), 351,600 people and 235 municipalities had been affected. By the end of the afternoon, there were 39 deaths.

The support of the federal government is essential, as it has already announced the deployment of one hundred agents from the National Force and 31 transport vehicles.

However, given the scale of the tragedy, which has left thousands homeless and without a livelihood, in addition to the loss of loved ones, all the action seems insufficient to alleviate such suffering.

It seems clear that something abnormal is happening and that global warming is at its root. Although extreme events may result from natural climate variation, this seems increasingly unlikely.

The government therefore needs to prepare for the worst-case scenarios. Nothing that is happening now has been predicted by science.

It remains urgent to mitigate global warming by cutting greenhouse gas emissions more drastically and decisively than has been done to date — but in reality, they continue to rise worldwide.

In the short and medium term, adapting to climate change should already be a priority for managers.

The federal government, states and municipalities need to create integrated action plans to mitigate the effects of global warming and the fatalities caused by the events, in areas such as forestry legislation, since green areas are essential to contain floods, and basic sanitation, which is shameful in Brazil.

If there are obstacles to reducing and cutting carbon emissions on a global scale, local authorities must take precautions to ensure that extreme events do not become, at the very least, catastrophic events.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective']",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The 11 climate activists from the Climáximo movement, who this Tuesday morning began a blockade of the Segunda Circular in Lisbon, from 9 am, in the middle of rush hour, on three of the four lanes in the direction of Benfica-Airport, have already been released by the authorities, after having been arrested during the protest.

The young people were released at 5 pm from the PSP police station in Benfica, where they were being held. As they left, there were some family members and colleagues from the movement, who clapped their hands and shouted new slogans, calling for government action to stop climate change. A poster was displayed that read “They are destroying everything you love”.

“Fires, floods, droughts, heat waves that kill thousands of people. They know this and continue to increase emissions. We need peace and a disarmament of the weapons that are pointed at all of us”, said Noah Zino, one of the activists.

The activists will appear before a judge tomorrow, at 10:00 am, at the Campus de Justiça, in Lisbon. Saying that they did not yet know the crimes they were accused of, they admit that they will most likely be charged with disobedience and disturbing public order.

“We have stopped accepting a normality that kills more people every two days than those who died in Pedrogão Grande, in the fires. We will support whoever wants to stop this genocide”, continued the activist, assuring that actions of this kind will continue to happen.

Nine of the arrested activists, who had been cutting off the Segunda Circular, were taken away by a vehicle from the special police unit, and the two hanging from the viaduct were eventually removed by the authorities, in particular the Lisbon Firefighters, and arrested.

Several ambulances from INEM, two firefighters from Lisbon with more than 10 officers, four special police unit vehicles and five officers from the Prevention and Immediate Reaction Team (EPRI) of the Lisbon Metropolitan Police Command were mobilized to the scene.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate change will lead to an average global sea level rise of between 32 and 84 centimetres by 2100.

Researchers at financial comparison service Money.co.uk have produced travel posters that imagine the impact of dramatic sea level rise on famous destinations.

Although exaggerated, the artworks are a way of drawing attention to the plight of many coastal areas due to rising sea levels.

However, there are a number of destinations that are likely to be affected by rising sea levels in the next hundred years. The team has created a map of tourist destinations around the world that are at risk of flooding and even disappearing altogether.

Fiji, a country whose economy is largely dependent on tourism, has already begun to see the effects of rising sea levels, with research showing that sea levels will continue to rise by 1-2 metres by 2100, putting the island at risk of being completely submerged. The Seychelles, Solomon Islands and Palau are also at risk of disappearing by 2100, which would be a devastating loss for the planet. 

Some of the world’s most popular tourist destinations, including London, Dubai, Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro, are vulnerable to extreme flooding by 2100. In Dubai, a three-metre rise would see the city lose much of its infrastructure. If sea levels rise by nine metres, Dubai could be completely submerged, making it the shortest-lived urban infrastructure in human history.

Access to 14 villages in the southern Russian Belgorod region bordering Ukraine will be closed to most civilians, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said Tuesday, citing the “extremely difficult” situation due to Ukrainian shelling.

Announcing the new restrictions in a video posted on his Telegram channel, Gladkov said that starting next week, only adult men accompanying military or government officials will be allowed to enter the settlements. Men must travel in armored vehicles and wear bulletproof vests and helmets, he added.

“I hope you will agree that it is unacceptable to allow women and children to enter the settlements that are shelled every day,” Gladkov said.

“We have already lost too many civilians, we have too many wounded. And of course, our task is to maximize security measures.”

The Belgorod region has come under frequent fire from Ukrainian bombers and drones. Air raid sirens sound almost daily in the regional capital of the same name, just 40 km (25 miles) north of the border. Ukraine says Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities has been devastating, and after nearly two and a half years of war, Russian forces now control about a fifth of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in May that Russian forces were working to create a buffer zone in northeastern Ukraine to protect Russia from attacks launched by Kiev’s forces across the border. Gladkov’s announcement is a sign that the security situation in the region may have become more dire, prompting authorities to do more to protect civilians. More than 200 civilians have been killed in the Belgorod region since the start of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine in February 2022, Gladkov told the state-run Tass news agency on Tuesday.

The promoters of these initiatives themselves are forced to admit this,"" said Sergei Lavrov, during a speech in the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament), quoted by the official news agency TASS.

In his speech, Lavrov considered that the West, led by the United States, used the ""Kiev regime"" to achieve these objectives, in addition to having made available ""a wide arsenal of hybrid warfare tools"", including economic and diplomatic sanctions, which also covered the sectors of information, culture and sports.

However, he stressed that the ""collective hostility"" of the West also allowed the emergence of ""new opportunities"" to direct Russia's relations in ""various geographical directions"", giving as examples China and Africa, which has become ""one of the poles of the emerging multipolar"".

Lavrov, who will visit Cuba, Venezuela and Brazil next week, noted that during his visit to Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday and Thursday – where he will participate in the summit of G20 foreign ministers (the 20 largest economies in the world) – Russia will continue to oppose the “selfish objectives” that have emerged within the group, including “the ‘Ukrainianisation’ of the agenda”.

Also regarding Ukraine, Lavrov once again noted that Russia is willing to start negotiations, as long as its “legitimate interests” are respected, which are completely contradictory to Ukrainian demands, which are committed to recovering the entire territory.

These words from the Russian Foreign Minister follow statements from other Russian sources who, on Tuesday, assured that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suggestion of a ceasefire in Ukraine and negotiations, following contacts between intermediaries last December, was rejected by the United States of America (USA).

An anonymous US official denied that there had been any formal contact and said that Washington would not engage in negotiations that excluded Ukraine.

Ukraine has received its first Western F-16 fighter jets, which have been expected for more than two years, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced today, showing them to journalists and stressing that their number is “insufficient”.

“We have held hundreds of meetings and negotiations” with allies to obtain these planes and strengthen the country’s air defense and “we often hear the words ‘it is impossible’ in response,” Volodymyr Zelensky said during a ceremony at a secret location in Ukraine, according to AFP.

“Now it is reality, reality in our skies. The F-16s are in Ukraine,” he said.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Kiev has been begging for the delivery of F-16s in the hope of ending Russian dominance in the air and better protecting its cities and military against incessant bombing by Moscow’s forces.

Made in the United States, the planes are considered the crown jewel in the extensive list of military equipment that Ukraine has requested from its allies in an attempt to repel the advance of Russian forces on its soil.

The Ukrainian president did not reveal the number of aircraft received by Kiev, saying only that it was “insufficient”, nor the number of Ukrainian pilots trained in the West to fly these aircraft.

The delivery date and the country that supplied this first batch were also not revealed.

“What is positive is that we expect more F-16s” and that “many of our men are being trained”, Zelensky assured.

AFP journalists saw at least two F-16s flying over the site during the ceremony.

The leader of the Hungarian far-right party 'Our Homeland Movement', Laszlo Toroczkai, said on Saturday that he would claim the Ukrainian region of Transcarpathia, which borders Hungary in western Ukraine and is home to around 150,000 Hungarians, if the country invaded by Russia loses the war.

According to the Reuters news agency, Toroczkai's words were spoken at a party press conference, which was also attended by leaders of the far-right parties Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Forum for Democracy, from the Netherlands, among others.

It should be noted that Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, with the argument of protecting the pro-Russian separatist minorities in the east and ""denazifying"" the neighboring country, independent since 1991, after the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, and which has been moving away from Moscow's sphere of influence and closer to Europe and the West. 

The war in Ukraine has already caused tens of thousands of deaths on both sides, but has not seen significant progress in the theater of operations in recent months, with the two belligerents remaining inflexible in their territorial positions and not open to concessions in negotiations.

Russia threatened on Thursday that the F-16 fighter jets promised to Ukraine by the West will be shot down, arguing that these aircraft will have little effect on the battlefield.

For almost two years, Ukraine has been asking its Western allies for the supply of F-16s, considered the 'crown jewel' of the extensive list of military equipment that Kiev has requested from its supporters.

According to some media, the American-made fighter jets have already been delivered. Several NATO countries have pledged to supply varying numbers of fighters and have been training Ukrainian pilots and crews for months. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made improving air defences a priority in meetings with allies, following Russia’s heavy air campaign in recent months. In an interview with Agence France Presse in May, Zelensky outlined the need for around 130 F-16s to ensure parity with the Russian air force. However, Ukraine’s partners have pledged to send fewer than 100 F-16s so far, with most of the aircraft likely to arrive over several years, after pilot training.","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

August is starting to get closer but summer still seems far away. Pedro Sousa, a meteorologist at the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA), confirms that this week, “we are witnessing an episode of hot weather” and, last week, “there were also some”. The heat that is being felt at the end of July is “relatively normal” and the meteorologist classifies these periods as typical “summer heat”.

“With no records and no very prolonged episodes of heat, it has been a calm summer”, admits the meteorologist. And that is indeed the case, especially since there have been many complaints that the heat arrived late.

August is expected to have above-average temperatures in the interior and below-average on the coast, says Pedro Sousa. The weeks are therefore expected to be dry and hot, with cooler temperatures on the coast.

“August is very likely to be hot,” he explains, due to the trend of global warming over the years and also the El Niño phenomenon, which “whenever it happens, the planet experiences high temperatures.” In addition, there are above-normal ocean anomalies that make the sea warmer, which also reduces the influence of the sea breeze on the temperature.

Despite this, the IPMA meteorologist warns that this is not an absolute certainty, since “forecasts are becoming less reliable” and a “forecast for three weeks from now can always change.” “Forecasts change quickly,” he concludes.

Comparing the temperature of August 2024 with the last three decades, he stresses that the weather forecast for next month should be higher, but “nothing guarantees that it will be hotter than last year or 2018,” which were marked by temperature phenomena.

“The predicted and observed temperatures are higher than in the last thirty years, which does not mean that they are very high,” he explains.

The end of July and the first week of August are expected to be hot and dry, with above-average temperatures inland and negative anomalies on the coast. “This is normal for summer,” says the expert.

As for this week, everything indicates that it will be “quite hot.” ​​Next week, however, temperatures should continue to be above average.",['CC: Downplaying climate change'],['CC: Downplaying climate change: Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Water shortages have led some Greek islands to ban swimming pools and resort to desalination. Just weeks after Greece experienced its earliest heatwave ever in June, parts of the country are now dealing with a new crisis: severe water shortages.

A state of emergency has been declared in Sifnos, the Cyclades, Leros, the Dodecanese islands, Sami, Kefalonia and parts of Crete.

Inhabitants in these regions are demanding urgent action as water supplies run low. Water levels are also low on the Attica peninsula, which includes Athens.

On the southern Aegean island of Naxos, the largest reservoir has dried up due to low rainfall and hot weather, according to Reuters news agency.

The lack of rain in recent months, combined with scorching temperatures of up to 40°C (104°F), has caused this situation. Inadequate infrastructure and lack of maintenance of desalination plants on the islands have further exacerbated the problem. 

Wildfires have also contributed to the crisis. In June, a fire on Serifos destroyed part of the island’s water supply network, which is now facing its lowest water reserves in 20 years. 

With the greatest need for water for water supply and irrigation, farmers are the worst affected. Many are being forced to rely on wells contaminated by seawater due to low water levels, Reuters reports. 

With the tourist season in full swing, visitor infrastructure is putting further pressure on water resources. Increased construction and the uncontrolled use of swimming pools have contributed to the water shortages on the islands, Elissavet Feloni, a hydrologist and professor at the University of West Attica, told Greek broadcaster Naftemporiki. 

Last month was the hottest June on record globally and the 13th consecutive month of record temperatures, according to Europe’s Copernicus climate service. It was also the 12th month in a row that the world has been 1.5C warmer than in pre-industrial times, extremes blamed on man-made emissions. With dry conditions expected to persist in the coming months, Feloni called for controls on water consumption and tighter government monitoring. Some islands have already taken action of their own. Karpathos and Serifos have imposed restrictions on the refilling of swimming pools. Viannos on Crete has imposed strict limits on the use of water for irrigation. The small Dodecanese island of Lipsi has stepped in early and banned the construction of swimming pools for the hot summer of 2023 to encourage a more sustainable approach to tourism. The northern island of Thassos is investing in a desalination plant to make seawater safe for drinking, according to Reuters. In places where a state of emergency has been declared, processes for transferring water, improving supplies and accessing government funds have been accelerated.

Three new wells are planned for Crete, while the navy has transported water to Leros, according to local media reports.

The water crisis on the Greek islands highlights the urgent need to adapt to climate change and manage natural resources more sustainably.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In recent years, with the recognition of climate change as a global phenomenon, a form of protest has become widespread among young ‘climate activists’. Integrated into the anti-establishment vanguard parties, they believe that they are saving the world from the apocalypse and consider themselves above the law.

The protests of these activists or radicals take many forms.

All over the world, they stick themselves to works of art to draw attention to their causes, usually forgetting that these works of art represent the best that the human spirit has produced over thousands of years of existence.

Another form of protest they find is sticking themselves to the ground in the most diverse places, occupying a space that is not theirs, believing that they can freely impose themselves on others.

We have already had some episodes like these here, some of them involving the pretense of believing that they are the only ones who care about the future of the planet and of Humanity, claiming to represent the vanguard of contemporary society.

They interrupted a private event where the Minister of Economy was present.

They invaded and stuck themselves to the floor of the Ministry of Economy.

They blocked access to the building where the Council of Ministers was to meet.

In another case, the leader of the JS of Oeiras, after insulting the Municipal Executive at a session of the Municipal Assembly of Oeiras, went to the Executive bench and threw a 10 euro note, in order to increase the municipal budget for the fight against climate change.

This week, those who hold the truth and are above good and evil invaded a CNN conference where the Minister of Environment was present, attacking the minister with bags filled with green paint, protesting against the minister's presence at an event supported by companies in the energy sector.

All of this is possible and all of this is tolerated because the poor 'young free radicals' are drawing attention to a greater cause, and because they want to save Humanity from itself.

In reality, all this is tolerated because the vast majority of the political class, as well as other institutions, live in a state of cowardly surrender to political correctness. Politicians are insulted or subjected to insinuations and are afraid to react. Fear is the worst advisor to decision-makers.

Governments, and the President of the Republic, have been particularly responsible for the establishment of this state of affairs. Portugal is a country completely conditioned by these groups, and by the hand that rocks their cradle.

A substantial part of the blockage of national decisions is due to the imposed public conditioning (with strong support from editorial offices), and this conditioning afflicts our society with fear. Yesterday it was made public that 40% of judges admit to being conditioned by the media. How many of the remaining 60% are still not telling the truth?

By reacting softly to these arrogant protests, we are tolerating the intolerable and recognizing legitimacy where it does not exist. In a free society there are no vanguards, nor does any group have moral superiority over others. It is unfortunate that today, saying so is an act of courage.","['CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments']",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Italian environmentalists used dye to dye Venice's Grand Canal green on Saturday (9) in protest against what they considered a lack of progress at COP28, the UN Climate Change Conference taking place in Dubai until next Tuesday (12).

Hanging from the Rialto Bridge over the canal, with the help of climbing ropes, activists from the group Extinction Rebellion also displayed a banner that read: ""COP28: While the government talks, we are hanging by a thread"".

Short stretches of rivers and canals in other Italian cities have also been dyed green in similar protests. ""In a few hours, these waters will be back to what they were before,"" the group said in a statement. ""In the meantime, we count the damage and victims of the constant floods and fires.""

According to the protesters, the visual effect was created by a dye used by companies to track items in the water. Boat traffic was halted during the protest, and the canal water and columns had to be checked for safety reasons, according to Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro. The politician criticized the activists' actions, calling them ""eco-vandals,"" and called on Italian authorities to punish them. ""Venice is a fragile city that must be loved and respected! Enough is enough,"" he said. Brugnaro borrowed the nickname given to the protesters from figures such as Italy's current culture minister, Gennaro Sangiuliano. The minister has been waging a crusade against environmental protests targeting monuments and works of art — acts that have become more common in recent years. In April, the government of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni announced a bill that would impose stricter fines, between 10,000 and 60,000 euros, for those who destroy, tarnish or disfigure, in whole or in part, cultural and landscape assets. The measures were added to sanctions already included in the penal code for this type of crime, which currently amount to five years in prison and a fine of 15,000 euros.

Three out of four young people aged 16 to 25 consider the “climate future frightening” and fear that world leaders will not be able to implement effective measures. This is according to the survey Young People’s Voices on Climate Anxiety, Government Betrayal and Moral Injury: A Global Phenomenon, which interviewed 10,000 people from countries such as the USA, India, France, Nigeria and Brazil in September. The survey also showed that 45% of these young people feel distressed, overwhelmed, anxious and guilty about the environment.

These figures explain and reflect the leading role that young people are demanding – albeit by force – in decisions to combat the climate crisis. “Our leaders are not our leaders. This is what a leader should look like”, said Greta Thunberg, pointing to the thousands of young people listening to her in Glasgow.

In Glasgow, young people from all over the world called for greater participation and representation in the negotiations. A declaration signed by 40,000 of them was delivered to the COP presidency and other leaders. “The actions and scrutiny of young people are essential to keeping the 1.5 degrees Celsius target alive and creating a zero-emissions future,” said Alok Sharma, president of the Conference. 

The Brazilian delegation included around 80 young people, the largest youth representation to date. And the only Brazilian to participate in the COP-26 opening ceremony was Txai Suruí, a 24-year-old indigenous woman. She shared the stage with António Guterres, UN Secretary-General, and Boris Johnson, British Prime Minister, and addressed diplomats from more than 190 countries. 

In her speech, Txai mentioned the murder of Ari Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, her friend and indigenous guardian killed in 2020 for protecting nature, and warned of the urgency of change. “Today the weather is warming; animals are disappearing; rivers are dying; Our crops do not flourish as they used to. The Earth is speaking. It tells us that we no longer have time.”

The significant negative impact of passenger vehicles on the climate could have fallen by more than 30% in the past decade if it weren’t for the world’s appetite for big cars, a new report from the Global Fuel Economy Initiative suggests.

Transportation is responsible for about a quarter of all climate-warming gases from energy, and much of that can be attributed to passenger transport, according to the International Energy Agency.

But the negative environmental impact of SUVs could have been cut by more than a third between 2010 and 2022 if people had continued to buy the same size cars, according to the initiative, a global partnership of cleaner vehicle groups.

One solution could be electric vehicles (EVs).

George Parrott, a 79-year-old avid runner who lives in West Sacramento, California, decided to switch to cleaner vehicles in 2004 when he bought a Toyota Prius hybrid. Since then, he has owned several pure electric cars and currently owns a Genesis GV60 electric SUV and a Tesla Model 3. 

Not all consumers feel the same way about energy consumption and environmental benefits, especially in the US. While EV sales accounted for 15% of the global auto market last year, that share was just 7.3% in the US. 

Meanwhile, smaller vehicles, or sedans, have lost a lot of ground in the US market over the past decade. In 2012, sedans accounted for 50% of the US auto retail space, with SUVs at just over 30% and trucks at 13.5%, according to car buying firm Edmunds. By 2022, sedans’ share in the US had fallen to 21%, while SUVs reached 54.5% and trucks grew to 20%. 

“People don’t want to be limited by space in their car,” said Eric Frehsée, president of the Tamaroff Group of dealerships in southeast Michigan. “Everybody wants a seven-passenger car.”

“This was a combination of broad environmental concerns,” he said.

More efforts are underway by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to improve the fuel economy and tailpipe emissions of gasoline-powered vehicles.

The Rio Negro, in Manaus, reached its third lowest level this Friday, the 13th, at 13.93 meters. The level is 28 centimeters away from breaking the record low level recorded in 2010, when the river reached 13.63 meters.

With the low level, the city government of Manaus issued a statement reinforcing the closure of Ponta Negra beach, which has been closed to swimmers since October 2nd.

The decision to close the beach for swimming, for reasons of safety and to prevent drowning, is due to the proximity between the end of the perennial landfill and the natural riverbed, which may present changes in the terrain, such as holes, unevenness and depressions.

Last Monday, October 9th, the beach was fenced off to physically delimit the area where bathers are prohibited, with signs measuring 1.20 meters high and 1,500 meters long. This physical restriction is intended to prevent people from passing through and to raise awareness among those who insist on bathing in the river in the restricted section.

Climate change is altering the landscape in several parts of the country

The Negro River has seen a very rapid decline, with a reduction of more than 7 meters in water column in just 20 days in September. The explanation lies in the El Niño phenomenon, which has prolonged the intensity of the drought in Amazonas.

The capital of Amazonas declared a state of emergency on September 28th due to the drought.

In addition, the local authority also recommended that the population not engage in physical activities. This is because Manaus was once again covered in smoke.

“I recommend not practicing sports. “We cannot breathe carbon monoxide, which causes problems. As a result, we are going to postpone our city marathon, which was scheduled for the weekend.

The Regional Livestock and Pastoralism Programme for Climate Adaptation in the East/North Africa region will be implemented in four transboundary group areas, including Mandera and Karamoja (Ethiopia), Mara-Serengeti (Tanzania) and Bahr Al Arab (Sudan and South Sudan).

Kenya, Somalia and Uganda are other countries targeted by the €47 million EU-funded project, of which €6.25 million is for Addis Ababa, the local state portfolio revealed.

Fikru Regasa, Ethiopia’s Minister of State for the sector, highlighted the fight against climate change and local efforts to deal with its effects, particularly in pastoralism.

FAO Country Representative Farayi Zimudzi said the programme is aligned with the UN agency’s strategic framework for “Better Production, Better Nutrition, Better Environment, Better Lives”. Zimudzi added that the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture is the main implementing partner of the initiative and plays a coordinating role at federal, regional and cluster levels (a group of interrelated and geographically concentrated companies and institutions competing in the same business).

Several tourists have been forced to be evacuated from hotels in Greece due to the threat posed by the numerous forest fires spreading across the country: according to the British ‘The Independent’, firefighters fought fires on the islands of Chios and Kos, in the eastern Aegean Sea, this Monday, which injured five people.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has already warned of a dangerous summer ahead, stressing that the help of the population was essential to limit the impact of forest fires: it is worth remembering that in 2023, 20 people died in forest fires during the summer months.

Greece has recently experienced several forest fires: however, the hotter, drier and windier weather, which scientists associate with the effects of climate change, has increased their frequency and intensity.

On Monday morning, emergency services issued evacuation orders for people in the Metohi area of ​​western Chios to move to a nearby beach – by the evening, more than 140 firefighters, along with eight specialist forest fire teams, seven aircraft and three helicopters were battling the blaze.

According to fire department spokesman Vasilis Vathrakoyiannis, two firefighters were slightly injured: state television ‘ERT’ later reported that two other firefighters and a volunteer suffered non-life-threatening burns. “The situation remains difficult in Chios, and all Civil Protection forces will make every effort to limit it,” Vathrakoyiannis assured.

Further south in the Aegean, another fire broke out on the tourist island of Kos, forcing the evacuation of several people, including tourists from hotels as a precaution: the blaze was tackled by more than 100 firefighters, including reinforcements sent from Athens, as well as six planes and two helicopters, Vathrakoyiannis added. Greece has seen 52 wildfires break out in the past 24 hours, 44 of which were tackled in the early stages, Vathrakoyiannis noted: the fires come a day after firefighters managed to control two major wildfires near Athens that were fuelled by strong winds. “We had an exceptionally difficult June in terms of weather conditions, with high levels of drought and exceptionally strong winds for this season,” Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Monday, adding that this summer “is set to be particularly dangerous” for wildfires. Clare Smith, who is on holiday in Kos with her husband and nine-year-old daughter, told Sky News that the situation had “worsened significantly” throughout the day, with “thick clouds of black smoke”. “It’s very windy here, it’s going to be like a powder keg. The sky is covered in smoke and it feels like you’re in the apocalypse, or some kind of war movie.”","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An international study involving Maria João Feio and Manuel Graça, researchers from the Centre for Marine and Environmental Sciences (MARE) at the Faculty of Science and Technology of the University of Coimbra (FCTUC), published in the journal Nature, concluded that, despite the positive trends of the 1990s, the recovery of river biodiversity stagnated from 2010 onwards.

In Europe, over the last three decades, and particularly since the publication of the Water Framework Directive in 2000, several mitigation measures have been implemented to combat the degradation of rivers and their ecosystems. However, the number of factors that threaten these ecosystems continues to increase worldwide.

Thus, “this study aimed to analyse whether, over the last few decades, there has actually been a recovery of aquatic biodiversity in riverine systems over time, as a result of the mitigation measures implemented in Europe, and what factors determined this”, explains Maria João Feio, adding that it was possible to conclude “that there was indeed a small increase in the number of species (0.73% per year), functional richness (2.4% per year) and abundance (1.7% per year) in aquatic macroinvertebrate communities”. However, the researcher continues, “despite these positive trends, the number of species still decreased in 30% of locations. The riverine ecosystems where the least recovery was observed were those located downstream of dams, in urban areas and agricultural lands. Furthermore, invertebrate communities located in areas with faster warming rates had less recovery, which shows the impacts of climate change, namely the effect of rising temperatures”, she warns. According to experts, the increases in biodiversity occurred mainly before the 2010s and have stagnated since then. The gains in biodiversity in the 1990s and 2000s reflect improvements in the physical and chemical quality of water, due to the implementation of more effective treatment systems and ecological rehabilitation or restoration projects. The slowdown in the recovery of riverine biodiversity in the 2010s shows that current measures are not sufficient, and are increasingly resulting in fewer positive results in the recovery of biodiversity.

This stagnation, the researcher adds, “occurred because new threats have also emerged, namely emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and microplastics, climate change and invasive species. In fact, the number of non-native species (found in 69% of the sites analyzed) has been increasing sharply (4% per year)”, she states.

In view of these results, the researchers consider it “urgent to continue ecological restoration based on renaturalization and recovery of species, not merely aesthetic, or focused on runoff, or the removal of nutrients from water, but also on new planning focused on new impacts, such as emerging pollutants, climate change and invasive species. In addition, the research also shows the importance of continuing ecological monitoring of rivers so that studies can be carried out that address temporal developments”, they conclude.

This research, which involved 96 European researchers from 70 institutions, was coordinated by researchers from the Senckenberg Research Institute and the Natural History Museum Frankfurt, Germany.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other']",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
593,PT_58.txt,"Climate crisis could impact insects’ sex lives, study finds

In cold weather, an insect with a darker body is better at capturing a mate than a rival with a brighter structure. Darker males can warm up more easily in the early morning and therefore have more time to mate while others are still warming up.

This is one of many examples of how temperature affects insects’ coloration and, in turn, can affect their ability to mate, according to a new review paper published in the journal Ecology and Evolution and reported by the Guardian.

Scientists are still trying to figure out what will happen to insects’ sex lives now that man-made climate breakdown is pushing temperatures to unprecedented levels.

“On the one hand, we could be happy and say, ‘How are the insects? They’re responding to climate change. We don’t need to worry about them,” said Mariella Herberstein, a behavioural ecologist at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, who is one of the study’s authors.

The prevailing theory among scientists, Herberstein says, is that as temperatures rise, insects largely evolve to produce less of the pigment that regulates their hue, becoming lighter and brighter. That’s because darker objects absorb more heat and warm up more quickly, while lighter objects reflect more radiation and can stay cooler for longer. 

For example, the wing colors of some North American mountain butterflies have faded over time as temperatures have risen—their bright sulfur-yellow wings have become paler, according to a 2016 study. 

Between the 1980s and 2000s, it became increasingly unlikely that the two-spotted ladybug would be black with red spots rather than red with black spots. 

But Herberstein’s team found that the pattern isn’t always that simple. A follow-up study of Meadii butterflies, which looked at more than 800 animals collected for museum collections between 1953 and 2013, found that in some areas, their yellow wings became richer and darker in color over time. “The mechanism is not so clear—it’s confusing,” said another of the study’s authors, Tonmoy Haque, a PhD student at Macquarie University. That may be because the researchers are working with a limited set of data from similar studies of similar insects, he says. It’s also likely because melanin doesn’t just have a heat-related function, but is involved in immune defenses and helps protect against ultraviolet radiation from the sun.",['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Russia said Thursday that it is ready to talk to Ukraine, but warns that it first needs to understand to what extent Volodymyr Zelensky's government is willing to negotiate.

""This is a difficult issue. From a legal point of view it is a problem, but from a practical point of view, we are open to achieving our goals through negotiations. Therefore, several variants are possible,"" the presidential spokesman said.

Zelensky's legitimacy as president of Ukraine has been an issue raised by Russia, which argues that the Ukrainian leader's term ended on May 20. The Russian spokesman said that in addition to ""problems with Zelensky's legitimacy"", there is also ""the problem of the ban on establishing any contact or negotiations with the Russian side, as this ban remains in force"".

""Russia is generally open to the negotiation process, but it is necessary to understand to what extent the Ukrainian side is prepared. So far, as you can see, we have heard very different statements. Things are not very clear,"" he added.

Peskov's statements come after Ukraine announced on Wednesday that it was ready to negotiate with Russia, demanding ""good faith"".

According to the Ukrainian security services (SBU), five people have been charged, one of whom was detained while trying to cross the Ukrainian border and faces a sentence of up to 12 years in prison.

The investigation comes as Kyiv tries to crack down on corruption in a bid to fast-track its accession to the European Union and NATO, one of the conditions set by its European partners.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected on an anti-corruption platform in 2019, long before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Both the president and his aides have pointed to the recent dismissals of senior officials, including Ivan Bakanov, the former head of the State Security Service, in July 2022, as evidence of their efforts to crack down on corruption.

Security officials say the current investigation dates back to August 2022, when officials signed a contract to purchase artillery shells worth 1.5 billion hryvnias (37 million euros) from the arms company Lviv Arsenal.

After receiving payment, the company's employees were supposed to transfer the funds to a foreign-registered company, which would then deliver the ammunition.

However, the goods were never delivered and the money was instead sent to various accounts in Ukraine and the Balkans, according to investigators.

The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office says the funds have since been seized and will be returned to the country's defense budget.

In the meantime, Ukraine today reported a wave of Russian attacks on its infrastructure in several regions of the country, and Russia announced that it had repelled new Ukrainian advances in Kharkiv and Donetsk.

Zaporizhia was one of the worst-hit regions, with at least 130 Russian shellings in the past 24 hours, according to the head of the Ukrainian regional administration, Yuri Malasko. At least 24 communities were hit by shelling in 33 drone strikes. Another 15 communities in the Sumy region were hit by Russian shelling, according to the Ukrainian military administration in the region, in a message also posted on its Telegram account. ""Ninety-one explosions were recorded at the regional level,"" according to the authorities.

597,PT_60.txt,"Earth's core is slowing down and may rotate in the opposite direction; understand how this affects the planet

Radical natural phenomena and events caused by climate change scare people about the future. Concerns apparently grew after a group of scientists recently suggested that the rotation of the Earth's core is slowing down and may start rotating in the opposite direction.

The theory was presented in a study published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience. According to the publication, the process began in 2019 and the new cycle may last up to 70 years, with the possibility of changing the length of days. However, the researchers reinforce that this is a structural phenomenon of the Earth and not a catastrophic event.

The authors of the research used seismic records to understand the change in the rotation of the Earth's core, and claim that this process may be related to some natural disasters.

After analyzing data on the planet's inner core between the 1990s and 2020, scientists have identified a noticeable change in recent years. However, this hypothesis does not come from these researchers alone. Professor John Vidale, dean of Earth Sciences at the California Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences (USC Dornsife), explained in an article in Nature Geoscience that the planet has undergone a slowdown until it began to rotate in reverse in recent years. This new movement would cause major changes in the functioning of all forms of life on Earth. The scientific community has concluded that the rotation of the core is not completely consistent, as it seemed to be constantly slowing down. Even so, experts emphasize that understanding the Earth's core is extremely difficult due to the impossibility of making direct observations. ""Here we analyzed repeated seismic waves from the early 1990s and showed that all the paths that previously showed significant temporal changes showed little change over the last decade. This globally consistent pattern suggests that the differential rotation of the inner core has recently been interrupted,” the study says.

Why is the Earth’s core spinning backwards?

The first discovery about how the Earth’s inner core works was made in a study conducted by seismologist Inge Lehmann in 1936. At that time, the Danish scientist realized that this region worked like a “solid metal ball.”

On the other hand, research into the variation in the core’s rotation speed occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. Then, in the early 1990s, the first seismological evidence was released.

Researchers used data from seismic waves and earthquakes to understand the interactions with the planet’s inner core. Even so, there are disagreements among scientists about this theory. Some of them argue that the data is still limited due to the difficulty of collecting samples and making precise observations.",['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Ukrainian General Staff did not mention the town in its report, but noted that the area around it had been engulfed in heavy fighting. Unofficial military sources reported the loss of at least two other towns in the sector.

Javier Milei believes in property rights and the privatization of natural resources to solve environmental problems. Why are whales becoming extinct but chickens are not?

Global warming? “Nothing, it's another lie of socialism. There's a whole agenda of cultural Marxism,” said Javier Milei, the anarcho-capitalist President-elect of Argentina, with a hairstyle that reminds one of an out-of-fashion football player. He doesn't believe in climate change, wants to abolish the Ministry of the Environment (among many others), privatize the Ministry of Science and believes in private property as a way to regulate pollution.

Climate change is not the fault of humans, he said, against all scientific evidence. “The world has had other peaks of high temperatures. It's a cyclical behavior, independent of the existence of man. Therefore, all these policies that blame humans for climate change are false and only serve to raise funds to finance lazy socialists who write fifth-rate documents,” he said in the second debate with Sergio Massa, the defeated candidate. 

Milei’s speech became famous in which he said that “a company can pollute a river however it wants.” Pause: “And? Where is the damage?” The problem, said the far-right politician, is that property rights are poorly defined. 

An economist, former rock singer and former football goalkeeper, among other colorful biographical details, Javier Milei defines himself as a libertarian who believes in defining property rights to solve potential environmental problems. 

“A company can pollute a river however it wants, and do you know why? Because this is a society in which there is plenty of water and the price of water is zero. Consequently, who is going to claim the right to property of that river? Nobody, because they can’t make money,” he said. Now, if someone owns the water in this river, they will be interested in negotiating with those who pollute it. “They will see how the contamination will end,” said Milei.

These policies that blame humans for climate change are false and only serve to raise funds to finance lazy socialists who write fifth-rate documents.

His main advisor, Alberto Benegas Lynch, illustrated the idea that involves the broad privatization of resources and state assets using whales. “Why are whales on the brink of extinction, while chickens and cows are not? The difference is in the fence that protects them. Where there is an owner, there is economic benefit, and this protects the fauna,” he said, suggesting privatizing the sea.","['CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Downplaying climate change: Other', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives', 'CC: Downplaying climate change: Climate cycles are natural', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures']",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A severe heatwave in the eastern Indian states of Bihar and Odisha is believed to have killed at least 24 people due to heatstroke, local authorities said. The extreme weather event is expected to last until Saturday.

India has been lashed by an extremely hot summer and a part of the capital, Delhi, this week recorded the highest temperature ever in the country, at 52.9 degrees Celsius, although this figure may be revised after the meteorological department checks the sensors at the weather station that recorded the reading.

While temperatures in northwest and central India are expected to cool in the coming days, the heatwave prevailing in eastern India is expected to continue for two days, said the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which declares a heatwave when the temperature is 4.5 to 6.4 degrees Celsius higher than normal.

Fourteen people died in Bihar on Thursday, officials said, including 10 people who were working to organise the seven-phase national elections that are underway. Citizens in parts of Bihar will vote on Saturday. Officials told Reuters that 10 people died at a government hospital in Odisha’s Rourkela region on Thursday.

The Odisha government has banned outdoor activities for its employees between 11 am and 3 pm, when temperatures peak.

Three people have died of suspected heatstroke in Bihar’s neighbouring state of Jharkhand, local media reported.

Animals in distress

In Delhi, where high temperatures have caused wild birds and monkeys to faint or fall ill, the city’s zoo is using pools and sprinklers to provide relief to its 1,200 occupants.

“We have switched to a summer diet, which includes a more liquid diet as well as all seasonal fruits and vegetables that contain more water,” Sanjeet Kumar, the zoo’s director, told the ANI news agency.

New Delhi, where temperatures are expected to reach 43 degrees Celsius (110 degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday, recorded its first heat-related death this week and is facing severe water shortages.

Thousands of people across Asia, including in neighbouring Pakistan, have been battling rising temperatures – a trend that scientists say has been exacerbated by human-caused climate change.

India, which is holding its national elections amid the heat, is the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases but has set a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2070.

As the heat grips parts of the country, the northeastern states of Manipur and Assam were hit by heavy rains following Cyclone Remal, with several areas flooded on Friday.

Wet bulb temperatures are rising around the world, and the Earth's climate has begun to exceed the 35ºC limit.

A study by NASA, the US space agency, has shown that some parts of the world could become uninhabitable in the coming decades due to climate change. According to the report, areas of the Center-West, Northeast, North and Southeast of Brazil are included in a study that mapped five regions.

Colin Raymond, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and author of a 2020 study on extreme heat and humidity, says that ""climate models tell us that certain regions are likely to exceed these temperatures [35ºC] in the next 30 to 50 years.""

In addition to Brazil, Raymond cites southern and parts of Southeast Asia, eastern China, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. The US is not immune either: within 50 years, midwestern states such as Arkansas, Missouri and Iowa will likely be in a critical situation as well.

The 35°C figure in the survey refers to the wet-bulb temperature used as a standard for measuring heat and humidity, especially in long-term global climate surveys.

According to Raymond, this is the highest wet-bulb temperature that humans can survive when exposed to it for at least six hours.

Wet-bulb temperatures are rising around the world, and the Earth’s climate has begun to exceed this 35°C threshold. This means that the hotter it gets, the more strain our bodies feel, and the more we need to sweat to cool down.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A 4-meter-long pink dolphin, made by artist Gil Reais, was the protagonist of Brazil's first protest action at COP28, in Dubai, held this Sunday (3).

The initiative, entitled “Boto Alerta: Queremos nadar na água, não no petrol!”, was carried out by the youth organization Engajamundo, in partnership with Greenpeace Brasil, in the Blue Zone of the UN climate conference.

The objective was to denounce the socio-environmental impacts that oil exploration in the Amazon region can cause, one of the issues that is clouding Brazil's presence at the first COP of the Lula government.

Brazil's protest at COP28 inspired by the death of dolphins

The inspiration for the sculpture was the death of dolphins impacted by the severe drought of the last period, representing the fauna and oil exploration in the Amazon River Basin.

For Marcelo Laterman, spokesperson for Greenpeace Brazil, the action carried out in partnership with Engajamundo denounces the contradiction of the Brazilian government in defending the expansion of the country's oil frontiers, especially in sensitive areas such as the Amazon, while at the same time seeking to reposition the country as a leading player in the climate agenda.

“In a creative way, these young activists are sending an important message: there is no virtuous future for the Amazon with the expansion of oil in the region. The opening of this new frontier could be marked as President Lula's worst socio-environmental legacy. The government must fulfill its promises and defend the Amazon, its people and face the climate crisis responsibly.”

Between 2012 and 2020, according to Engajamundo, the number of oil fields in the Amazon increased by 13% and, if this new frontier on the Amazon coast is opened, this number will increase exponentially.

Brazil is the 9th largest oil producer in the world. Engajamundo and Greenpeace criticize Basil's entry as an observer at OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), in the middle of COP28, ""which shows that the country and its leaders still have oil as an economic priority, despite speeches in defense of decarbonization"".

Jaciara Borari is one of Engajamundo's indigenous activists and is part of the delegation that organized this action.

""We want the protest at COP28 to somehow express the urgency of this agenda reaching decision-makers, and for the process of oil exploration in the Amazon River Basin to be rethought and blocked.

The head of the United Arab Emirates oil company was appointed on Thursday (12) as chairman of the annual UN climate conference, scheduled for the end of the year in the Gulf country, drawing criticism from environmentalists.

The UAE's Industry Minister, chairman of oil giant ADNOC (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) and special envoy for climate change, Sultan Ahmed al Jaber, is the ""chairman-designate for the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28),"" the official WAM news agency reported in a statement on Thursday.

It will be the first time that a company chairman will lead the COP, which this year will be held in Dubai between November and December.

""We will bring a pragmatic, realistic and solution-oriented approach,"" Sultan Ahmed al Jaber said after his appointment. ""Climate action represents a major economic opportunity to invest in sustainable growth. Financing is key,"" he added.

Sultan Ahmed al Jaber has headed the UAE’s national oil company since 2016, as well as Masdar, the country’s renewable energy company. His dual role has drawn criticism from environmentalists. “The appointment of Sultan Ahmed al Jaber to the COP28 presidency as chairman of Abu Dhabi’s national oil company is an outrageous conflict of interest,” said Harjeet Singh of Climate Action Network International. “The constant threat of fossil fuel lobbyists at UN climate talks has always undermined the outcome of climate talks. This has now reached a dangerous and unprecedented level,” he added. Oil and gas lobbyists were plentiful at COP27 in Egypt last November, up 25% from the previous meeting in Glasgow, according to environmental groups. The largest contingent of lobbyists were from the UAE, followed by Russians. The United Arab Emirates, one of the world’s largest oil exporters, is advocating a phase-out of hydrocarbons and has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The country has experienced rapid economic growth since the 1970s, fueled by oil, but its economy has gradually diversified. “Limiting warming to 1.5°C [as set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement] will require significant emissions reductions, a pragmatic, practical and realistic approach to the energy transition, and increased support for emerging economies,” the statement released today said.

604,PT_183.txt,"Austrian climate activists 'Last Generation' end protests due to lack of results

The 'Last Generation' movement has demonstrated in many different ways over the years, often in disruptive ways, in an attempt to gain media and public attention.

The most high-profile actions have included road closures, disruptions to motorsport and winter sports events, confrontations with politicians, disruptions to theatre performances, cementing cars, disrupting shareholder meetings of fossil fuel companies, disrupting marathons and, most recently, protests at airports.

The group has now announced an end to the protests, at least until it finds new ways to make its voice heard. 'Last Generation' says that the government is not responding and that society itself has come out in favour of the use of fossil fuels.

""The form of protest was absolutely necessary at the time we decided to do it. We also needed a certain amount of everyday disruption,” says Anja Windl, an activist with the “Last Generation”. “But ultimately the problem of failure is more that few people dared, did not have the courage to actually peacefully confront the government.”

Activist Afra Porsche is calm about facing the authorities’ investigations into the protests the group has already held. She also believes that the protests will return, but in a different form.

“We need to shake things up. Civil resistance is legitimate and democratic. There will be resistance again, but in a different form,” says Afra Porsche.

Group succeeds in attracting attention

Communications expert Jakob-Moritz Eberl believes that the group has at least achieved its goal of attracting attention.

""The aim was to generate awareness and draw attention to the fact that the situation is unpleasant,"" says Jakob-Moritz Eberl. ""There is scientific evidence that the importance of the climate crisis or climate change increases significantly after such actions, even for a short period of time, but the issue becomes important for society."" Meteorologist Michael Staudinger from the group ""Scientists for the Future"" argues that scientists also have an important role to play in raising awareness of these concerns. ""Well, it was an attempt to convey a certain message. It wasn't very successful, but we understand that young people expressed their concerns in their own way,"" says Eberl. ""Now we have to see what happens next. Science has to communicate these issues in the right way."" The scientist stresses that the situation is ""very serious"" and that young people are the ones who will be most affected. ""The next generation and the generation after that will be affected ten times more than ours,"" he concludes.","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other']",1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The creation of the new structure was a campaign promise made by Lula, when Marina Silva, current Minister of the Environment, joined his candidacy in 2022.

— Our focus needs to be on adaptation and preparation to face these phenomena (extreme climate risks). To this end, we will establish a climate authority and a technical-scientific committee that supports and coordinates the implementation of the federal government's actions — said the president, during a meeting with mayors to announce measures to combat drought in the state, in an excerpt read from his speech.

Lula added that the ""objective is to establish the conditions to expand and accelerate public policies based on a national plan to face extreme climate risks"".

According to the proposal presented in the election, the National Authority for Climate Change would have the objective of monitoring the measures taken by the government to reduce the emission of gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. After the victory, the proposal was put aside. One of the reasons given was budgetary constraints.

Lula traveled to Amazonas accompanied by ministers Rui Costa (Chief of Staff), Marina Silva (Environment), José Múcio Monteiro (Defense), Nizia Trindade (Health), Wellington Dias (Social Development) and Silvio Costa Filho (Ports and Airports).

The president announced an investment of 81.8 million euros in dredging interventions in the rivers of the state of Amazonas, to facilitate navigation in the midst of the drought. The paving of a 20-kilometer stretch of the BR-319 highway was also promised, at a cost of 25.8 million euros.

During his speech, Lula also criticized the administration of his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro (PL).

""The previous plan for the environment was clear; it was to open the gate to let the cattle through. And we think that we can even raise cattle, but we don't need to destroy the forest and our planet in order to raise cattle. And that's why we're treating it with great decency.""

The Amazon has been recording below-average rainfall since July. In recent weeks, fires have left cities and even indigenous territories covered in smoke. On August 27, 1,516 fires were recorded in the Amazon, according to the monitoring panel of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE): 39% in Pará, 29% in Amazonas, 12% in Acre, 10% in Rondônia and 8% in Mato Grosso.

The world had its hottest day on record again on Monday (22), surpassing Sunday (21), which also broke a record, according to preliminary data from a European Union monitoring agency.

With heatwaves raging around the world and wildfires raging in parts of the Mediterranean, Russia and Canada, the global average surface air temperature rose to 17.15 degrees Celsius (°C) on Monday. That was 0.06°C higher than Sunday's record, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, which has been tracking such data since 1940.

That includes temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere, which is currently in winter, lowering the global average.

Scientists said it was possible that Tuesday and Wednesday this week could surpass Monday's record again.

Previously, the record hot day was set in July 2023, when the average daily peak was broken for four consecutive days – from July 3 to 6. Before that, the record was set in August 2016.

El Niño

What makes this year’s record unusual is that, unlike in 2023 and 2016, in April the world exited the El Niño weather pattern, which typically boosts global temperatures due to warmer-than-normal waters in the Eastern Pacific.

Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Leipzig in Germany, said it was remarkable that the record had been broken again now that the world was in the “neutral” phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.

This points to climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, having a greater influence than ever on rising global temperatures.

""Last Monday may have set a new world record for the hottest absolute global average temperature ever recorded, that is, in tens of thousands of years,"" Haustein said.

China has issued a series of heat alerts this week, with dozens of weather stations in parts of the central and northwestern part of the country recording temperatures above 40°C.

Extreme events

Taiwan braced for the impact of Typhoon Gaemi on Wednesday, with factories and financial markets closed amid forecasts of torrential rain.

Scientists say climate change is making typhoons — tropical cyclones that gain energy by feeding on ocean heat — more intense, capable of reaching higher wind speeds and dumping more rain.

Japan has also been experiencing record heat throughout July. Heatstroke alerts were issued in 39 of the country's 47 prefectures on Monday, with temperatures above 37°C.

More than 40 million Americans were facing dangerous temperatures on Tuesday, especially in the western United States, where gusty winds and dry conditions have fueled dozens of wildfires. Even the Arctic is experiencing a heatwave. Fairbanks, Alaska, is expected to reach 31°C on Wednesday, approaching previous records, while temperatures in parts of the Canadian, Russian and Norwegian Arctic were reaching temperatures more than 9°C above the 1979-2000 average for this time of year.","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""We are experiencing a drop in our sugar production due to some difficulties caused by the bad weather in the country in recent years,"" Pascoal Macule, director of Tongaat Hulett, the group that owns Açucareira de Mafambisse, told reporters on Thursday.

The director said that the company's annual production of 75,000 tons had fallen to 40,000 in the last two years, causing significant losses to the factory.

Another factor that influenced the sharp drop in production was the loss of around 8,000 hectares of sugar cane, the raw material for sugar production, due to the effects of climate change: ""This is happening in Nhamatanda, due to the drought in our fields and the El Niño phenomenon.""

Located in the administrative post of Mafambisse, in the district of Dondo, in Sofala, the sugar mill has the installed capacity to produce 92 thousand tons of sugar per year.

Mozambique is considered one of the countries most severely affected by climate change in the world, cyclically facing floods and tropical cyclones during the rainy season, which runs from October to April.

The 2018/2019 rainy season was one of the most severe in living memory: 714 people died, including 648 victims of cyclones Idai and Kenneth, two of the largest ever to hit the country.

The province of Sofala, in the center of the territory, has been one of the most affected by storms.

In the first quarter of last year, heavy rains and the passage of Cyclone Freddy caused 306 deaths, affected more than 1.3 million people in the country, destroyed 236 thousand homes and 3,200 classrooms, according to official government data.

Tongaat Hulett recently announced an injection of 500 million rand (25 million euros) into the Mafambisse and Xinavane sugar mills, both in Mozambique and in which the South African group is the majority shareholder.

The challenges faced by the two sugar mills in recent times include countering a continuing decline in sugar sales and obtaining support to prevent low-priced sugar imports from entering the domestic market and affecting domestic production.

To turn the situation around, according to the director of Tongaat Hulett, Mafambisse Sugar Mill has adopted several strategies, including seeking more financial partners to leverage the company.

Ukrainian forces have been waiting for these reinforcements for more than two years. But this is “not enough”, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned.

Ukraine has received its first Western F-16 fighters, which have been expected for more than two years, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced today, showing them to journalists and stressing that their number is “not enough”.

“We have held hundreds of meetings and negotiations” with allies to obtain these planes and strengthen the country’s air defence and “we often hear the words ‘it is impossible’ in response”, said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during a ceremony at a secret location in Ukraine, according to AFP.

“Now it is reality, reality in our skies. The F-16s are in Ukraine”, he said.

Since the Russian invasion began in February 2022, Kiev has been begging for the delivery of F-16s in the hope of ending Russian dominance in the air and better protecting its cities and military from incessant bombing by Moscow's forces.

Made in the United States, the planes are considered the crown jewel in the extensive list of military equipment that Ukraine has requested from its allies in an attempt to repel the advance of Russian forces on its soil.

The Ukrainian president did not reveal the number of aircraft received by Kiev, saying only that it was “insufficient”, as well as the number of Ukrainian pilots trained in the West to fly them.

The delivery date and the country that supplied this first batch were also not revealed.

“What is positive is that we expect more F-16s” and that “many of our men are being trained”, Zelenskyy assured.

AFP journalists saw at least two F-16s flying over the site during the ceremony.

Behind Volodymyr Zelenskyy, two more gray aircraft resembling F-16s were placed on the ground, partially covered by camouflage nets and with their tails emblazoned with the national emblem, the trident.

The climate justice discourse is yet another nonsense in the debate led by groups on the watermelon left: green on the outside, red on the inside.

The combination of the two ideas, justice and climate, is abhorrent. Opinions or policies with this level of absurdity must be denounced and rejected! Justice is a social concept. There is no justice without human beings in society. The climate, in turn, corresponds to a set of atmospheric conditions in a region over many years.

And most importantly, the climate does not depend on humans. The climate depends mainly on the Sun. Without the Sun, there would be no climate, no life on Earth, no human beings – watermelons or not.

The watermelon left replaces the family with the climate in the formulation of national and global policies. In the name of climate justice, draconian environmental measures are taken. They drive industry out of Europe and make fuel prices unsustainable. Our tax burden on diesel is 44% and gasoline is 51%. We all know the consequences. More expensive transport and products. Fewer job opportunities. Fewer jobs. Less justice.

And with everything getting more expensive, we still have to pay for a poorly conceived energy transition. We are forced to bear environmental costs ignored by countries like China, which has almost 200 times more emissions than ours.

Italy's Minister of Transport and Infrastructure Matteo Salvini has suggested that Emmanuel Macron go to Ukraine and take part in hostilities.

""I will tell Macron: go to Ukraine to fight, put on a helmet and don't mess with the Italians,"" Salvini said at a campaign event for his League party's candidate for mayor of the city.

The League leader has repeatedly criticized NATO and EU leaders for their stance on increasing military support for Kiev and their willingness to lift restrictions on Ukraine's attacks with Western weapons on the territory of the Russian Federation. EU foreign minister Josep Borrell Salvini has called the Demoman and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg ""Mr. Dangerous.""

Macron has previously said he does not rule out sending troops to Ukraine if Russia breaks through the front lines and Ukraine asks for it. According to him, ""many countries"" agreed with France's approach to the possible deployment of troops.

According to the newspaper ""Monde"", Macron wants to create a European coalition to send military instructors to Ukraine.

Russian President's spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the rhetoric of Paris and London on the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine dangerous. The Kremlin also said that it drew attention to Macron's words on the topic of sending troops to Ukraine in Europe, his position on inflicting a ""strategic defeat"" on Moscow is also well known.

612,PT_77.txt,"The former ambassador who received 2 sailboats, was against the Ukrainian government and revealed a “state secret” is the head of Chega’s list in the European elections

António Tânger Corrêa, who was the general secretary of the Juventude Centrista (CDS) and deputy to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Diogo Freitas do Amaral, in the original AD government, was confirmed in the press this weekend as the head of Chega’s list in the next European elections.

The former ambassador is the protagonist of several controversies, with a long history of 30 years of treading the line, according to the newspaper Público, where the “gift” of a sailboat stands out, but in fact there were two (you can read the full story on Facebook here).

According to the same newspaper, “António Ranger’s” career is a catalogue of “cases” that included breaking into a house and being suspended by the MNE with an unprecedented sentence in the profession — the first for an active ambassador serving abroad.

António Tânger, who followed in his father’s footsteps in the diplomatic career, was suspended in 2009 for 90 days due to several irregularities found in the management of the Portuguese embassy in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.

But the controversies of Chega’s No. 1 in the European elections of June 2024 do not stop with situations when he was representing Portugal, more recently, and as vice-president of André Ventura’s party, he adopted a position contrary to the party leader, accusing President Zelensky’s government of having responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine, using a copied message.

In February 2022, days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, António Tânger began by making an incorrect prediction and criticizing the ""commentators who are pitiful for their ignorance"" because ""will there ever be a war?""

After making this comment, he ""copied"" a text on Facebook that accuses the president of Ukraine and justifies Russia's position. This text was posted on his page without identifying the author, later identified after the person responsible contested the copy, and was later deleted from his page after it was also reported in Expresso.

Months earlier, in September 2021, the vice-president of Chega revealed a conspiracy theory to the press that was later not confirmed, when he announced a ""state secret"" before the elections, because according to the former ambassador, a ""working group had been created between the secret services and the Judicial Police to incriminate Chega"" in an alleged connection with the deniers.

In January 2023, on the second day of the 5th Chega Convention in Santarém, António Tânger Corrêa recalled the times when he was leader of the Centrist Youth to ask for greater presence and dynamism for the Chega Youth: 

I don't want the Chega Youth to be like the others. I wanted to see the Chega Youth, call me nostalgic or whatever you want, fighting in the streets with blows against the MRPP and the PCP. 

He was greatly applauded by the nostalgic supporters, which led the former ambassador to also state: “In my time, it was a clean sweep”.",['URW: Discrediting Ukraine'],['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Donald Trump's entry into the US presidency could mess everything up and leave Europe vulnerable

""If anyone thinks this is just about Ukraine, they are completely mistaken."" The warning was made by the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The Ukrainian president's objective is not new: the idea is to continue pressuring the West, particularly the United States, to continue providing financial and military support to Kiev, at a time when Congress is at an impasse in approving more aid.

And if the situation is complicated with Joe Biden's administration, behind the scenes there are fears that a possible election of Donald Trump will only make everything worse. The former president and likely Republican Party candidate has said, on several occasions, that he wants to leave NATO and stop providing military assistance to Western allies.

If this were to extend to Ukraine, Kiev would have a hard time resisting Moscow's advances, and it is possible that sooner or later it would fall.

This scenario has left several European countries on edge, and many of them fearful that they would not be able to resist a possible Russian advance beyond Ukraine, especially if the United States were not available to provide support.

“We always thought there was a threat like this,” said Major General Veiko-Vello Pal, commander of the Estonian army, speaking to The New York Times about a possible Russian invasion.

But the problem is not just the possible lack of American aid. The official from Estonia, one of the countries of the former Soviet Union, which borders modern-day Russia, was merely echoing what the country has been saying for a long time.

Because of its geographical location, Estonia is one of the most vulnerable countries. For this reason, it is also one of the countries that has contributed the most to NATO, having one of the largest armies in terms of size, but it will never be enough to defend the country from a power like Russia.

The problem is, according to Veiko-Vello Palm, that many other countries do not have this capability either. “In the last few years we have made it very, very clear that, as a military alliance, many NATO countries are not ready to conduct large-scale operations,” he said.

“Simply put, many NATO armies are not ready to fight Russia,” he concluded, admitting great discomfort with the situation.","['URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

A drone strike launched by Ukraine overnight caused a fire at an oil refinery and killed one person in southern Russia, Russian and Ukrainian authorities reported on Monday (22).

Kiev and Moscow have stepped up their cross-border attacks on each other, both with missiles and drones, in recent months, targeting mainly energy infrastructure.

The Russian regional authorities of the Black Sea and the town of Tuapse, in the Krasnodar region (south), explained that the fall of drone debris caused a fire at a refinery, which required the mobilization of a hundred firefighters.

The governor of Belgorod, another region in southern Russia, reported that a person driving a tractor died after being hit by a Ukrainian drone, and that his wife was injured.

A Ukrainian defense source said that drones related to military intelligence services were used and that the damaged refinery is operated by Russian state-owned giant Rosneft.

“The extent of the damage to the military-industrial complex of the aggressor state is being verified,” the source said in a written statement.

According to the Russian Defense Ministry, 75 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight, 47 of them in the southern region of Rostov, another in Belgorod, two more in Voronezh and Smolensk, and eight in the skies over Krasnodar.

Another 17 drones were shot down while flying over the Black Sea and the Sea of ​​Azov, according to the ministry.

Russia announces, almost daily, that it has shot down Ukrainian drones on its territory.

According to Kiev, these attacks are a response to Russian bombings as part of the invasion of the country, launched by Moscow in February 2022.

The announcement was made by John Kerry, the United States' climate envoy, during the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) which runs until December 12 in Dubai.

China and Russia, the world's largest builders of nuclear power plants, are not among the signatories.

In addition to the United States, France and the United Arab Emirates, the declaration was signed by Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Ghana, Hungary, Japan, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, South Korea and the United Kingdom.

""The declaration recognises the key role of nuclear energy in achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and in maintaining the goal of (limiting global warming to) 1.5°C"", the text states.

""We know from the science, the facts and the evidence that we cannot achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 without nuclear power,"" said John Kerry.

Romanian President Clausus Johannites explained that nuclear power represents for the European country ""a stable energy source that contributes to energy security and decarbonisation"".

The signatory countries also call on international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, to include nuclear power in approved financing.

""There are statutory provisions, sometimes in certain international lending institutions, that exclude nuclear power. I think that is completely obsolete,"" the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, told Agence France-Presse.

July 2024 has gone down in history as the hottest month on record in Greece, according to preliminary data analysed by the scientific team at meteo.gr and the National Observatory of Athens. This record heat not only exceeded the average July temperature for the period 1991-2020 by 2.9°C, but also surpassed the previous record set in July 2012 by 0.3°C.

July 2024: a month of historical records in Greece and around the world

Analysis of climate data has revealed that July 2024 was marked by long periods of exceptionally high temperatures, significantly exceeding seasonal normals across the country. This pattern of extreme heat is in line with a worrying trend observed in recent decades: since 1960, the average July temperature in Greece has increased by 2.5°C.

Furthermore, over the past four years, three of the four hottest Julys in the past 80 years have been recorded in Greece, highlighting a growing trend of extreme temperatures attributed to climate change. Furthermore, the persistent heat of July 2024 was compounded by one of the longest heatwaves since 1980. This heatwave occurred between 8 and 23 July.

But anyone who thinks this trend is limited to Greece is mistaken. In fact, globally, 21 July 2024 was considered the hottest day on record, with a global average temperature of 17.1°C, as reported by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. This record was surpassed again the following day, 22 July, with the global average temperature reaching 17.2°C.

Adaptation and mitigation measures: Greece’s response to extreme heat

The inherent concerns cannot be ignored. The Greek authorities have been taking steps to adapt and mitigate the impacts of extreme temperatures. During peak heat waves, several cities have opened air-conditioning centres to help vulnerable populations.

In addition, there has been an increase in preparedness and response to forest fires, which are a greater threat during periods of extreme heat. For example, civil protection personnel have been concerned about closing Greece’s most visited monument, the Acropolis in Athens, between 12pm and 5pm when the heat is at its highest.

The data for July 2024 reinforce the urgency of concrete measures to adapt to climate change. Record temperatures, not only in Greece but globally, are a clear sign of the intensification of extreme weather events, which have been spreading throughout the month of August.

Culturally distinct groups characterized by their own forms of social organization and which relate to their territories and natural resources as a fundamental condition for their cultural, social, economic and spiritual reproduction will be considered traditional communities. This includes indigenous people, andirobeiras, everlasting plant gatherers, caatingueiros, mangaba gatherers, quilombolas, extractivists, riverside dwellers, caiçaras, gypsies, terreiro peoples, cipozeiros, chestnut trees, faxinalenses, fundo and fecha de pasto, geraizeiros, islhéus, isqueiros, morroquianos, pantaneiros, artisanal fishermen, piassava growers, pomeranos, babassu coconut breakers, retireros, rubber tappers, vazanteiros and veredeiros.

The Fund indicates that these communities have been greatly affected by the advance of the exploitation of biomes observed in Brazil in recent years, with the growth of illegal occupations and agrarian conflicts. In addition, it notes that they are also impacted due to their vulnerability to the consequences of climate change, such as drought or excessive rainfall depending on the region and time of year.

From 2015 to 2017, the water crisis in Espírito Santo required tough measures, such as the prohibition of irrigation of plantations during the day in municipalities in critical situations, with economic impacts on the agricultural sector. Industries also committed to reducing consumption. The population had to commit to a culture of rationing.

The state government then began a program to build multipurpose dams. The Reis Magos supply system, in Serra, was also inaugurated in 2017, in this context, reducing the overload on the Santa Maria da Vitória System. And, in 2018, the construction of the Jucu River dam between Domingos Martins and Viana was announced, with the capacity to store 23 billion liters of water: accumulating the resource in the wet season for use in the dry season, as the little ant teaches in the fable. This important project, which is progressing slowly, is included in the PAC. Its urgency is undeniable.

In this atypical month of November, with no rain, in which Espírito Santo is one of the states affected by the heat wave, the alert for a new water supply crisis is sounding. In the Metropolitan Area, the Jucu and Santa Maria rivers are approaching the critical level, as reported by Leonel Ximenes in his column.

Cesan also reported that the rivers from which the company collects water to supply the population have had their water levels reduced due to the recent drought and warned that the situation affects the 53 municipalities served by the company. In Pinheiros, in the north of the state, the water supply has been compromised in the district of São João Sobrado for 15 days, requiring the use of tanker trucks. Neighborhoods in Marataízes, on the South Coast, have also been suffering from a lack of water since last week.

As previously stated, this is still only a warning, which requires the government to prepare contingency actions. No government has the ability to control when it rains or shines, but experience in previous critical scenarios should teach what needs to be done to avoid or face future supply crises. Without standing idly by.

Dry periods, like rainy ones, are cyclical and unpredictable, but will become increasingly common with climate change. Governor Renato Casagrande chairs the Green Brazil Consortium, created in 2021 to develop coordinated actions among federative entities, obtaining external financial resources and seeking good practices to mitigate the climate effects in the country.

Investments are needed not only in large-scale projects, but also in less grandiose rainwater harvesting projects, as well as projects for the industrial reuse of water and the conservation and recovery of riparian forests, which are responsible for the health of rivers.

Brazil at COP28: Lula and Marina with ideas and solutions

Environment and health: Approval of the 'Poison Bill' goes against new trends and happens at the worst time

I spoke this morning with Minister Marina Silva, who is already in Dubai for the conference, and she told me that Brazil will present the new financing mechanism for forest countries tomorrow.

This is a new path, in addition to those that already exist and that could prosper in the negotiations over the next few days, such as the 91.4 billion euros per year for mitigation and adaptation, which, in COP jargon, means that rich countries with older industrialization will finance policies to reduce the impacts of climate change and also to adapt to irreversible changes in developing nations.

There is another path, which is the agreement on losses and damages. Speaking from there today, the minister stated that the agreement is being reached to make compensation for vulnerable countries concrete.

COP28: Survey shows that workers would like to contribute to sustainability, but are unaware of the companies' strategy

The problem is that here in Brazil, Congress is sending a signal that is completely contrary to the agenda presented by Brazil at COP28. By approving a subsidy for coal, what Congress is doing is subverting the meaning of the green agenda, corrupting the meaning of the wind power law to serve the lobbies and transferring to itself, the reader, the cost of this contradiction. Subsidizing coal also means adding this cost, estimated at 4.6 billion euros per year, to the electricity bill.

There is also a contradiction in Dubai, of course. There is an expectation of progress on the climate change agenda at COP28, despite the fact that it is being held in the United Arab Emirates, the heart of the oil industry, which is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases and therefore a large part of the problem.

Minister Marina Silva told me that the great victory would be to leave the conference with a commitment to reduce the use of fossil fuels, which will be challenging since the president of COP28, Sultan al-Jaber, also heads the local oil company.

Contradictions: On the way to the COP, Lula will go to the birthplace of oil and tyranny in the Middle East

This meeting is expected to provide the first assessment of the commitments, national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions established in the Paris Agreement. But it will be in Brazil, at COP30, ten years after the agreement signed in the French capital, that the great adjustment and the reestablishment of goals will be made.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said this Friday, the 1st, that world economies need to address the debate on fossil fuels and reduce their use. The president's speech was given at COP 28, in the United Arab Emirates, one day after Brazil received an invitation from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Allies (OPEC+) to join the group.

“The world is already convinced of the potential of renewable energy. It is time to address the debate on the slow pace of decarbonization of the planet and work towards an economy less dependent on fossil fuels,” he said. In his opening speech, Lula drew attention to the increase in global temperatures on the planet and extreme global events, such as the historic drought in the Amazon and cyclones in the southern region of Brazil. “The bill has come early,” said the president, stating that the planet is “fed up” with climate agreements that are made and not fulfilled, and reiterated that Brazil is willing to lead “by example.”

The day before, Brazil received an invitation to join OPEC+, the organization that controls oil prices through a cartel of large producers such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, as well as other allied countries, such as Mexico and Russia. The organization, which uses increased fuel production to control the value of the commodity on the international market, has a different view from that defended by Lula in his speech at the COP, which is that fossil fuels should continue to be used.

This Friday, Petrobras CEO Jean Paul Prates told Reuters that Brazil should join the OPEC+ group of oil producers. According to him, the country should play a role of cooperation and observation of decisions, but without participating in the production quota system.

“They call on other countries that do not have the right to vote and are not subject to quotas. We would never participate in an entity that established a quota for Brazil, especially with the support of Petrobras, which is a publicly traded company and cannot have a quota,” the executive stated.

In addition to defending the use of renewable energy, and the obvious awkward situation that the country is in by accepting to join OPEC+, Lula said in his speech that spending on weapons and wars should be used to combat hunger and climate change. “How many tons of carbon are emitted by missiles that cross the sky and fall on innocent civilians, especially children and women?”

The president also said that “the world has naturalized unacceptable disparities in income, gender and race and that it is not possible to confront climate change without combating inequality.”

In his speech, Lula also criticized the UN’s stance on its inability to maintain peace, “simply because some of its members profit from war.” The United Nations has Russia, Ukraine and Israel as member countries, for example. “Governments cannot be exempted from their responsibilities. No country will solve its problems alone. We are all obliged to act together, beyond our borders. Brazil is willing to lead by example. We have adjusted our goals, which are now more ambitious than those of many developed countries,” he said.","['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities']",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
621,PT_157.txt,"United Kingdom: The country has been invaded by a new species of jumping spider!

Scientists have recently discovered a new species of spider in the south of England. It is believed that its migration has been facilitated by climate change. Researchers assure that this species is not poisonous to humans. However, it is attracting a lot of attention.

But what is happening? Several cities in the United States have recently been on alert for invasions of giant exotic spiders. It is enough to make people panic. Now it is the turn of Europe, more specifically, the southern regions of the United Kingdom.

During a biological census carried out by the British Arachnological Society in Penryn, west Cornwall (England), in 2023, researchers identified for the first time a species of spider native to the Caribbean. Far from the giant exotic spider invading the United States, this species is tiny, measuring no more than 3 to 4 mm in length.

Scientifically called Anasaitis milesae, this species of jumping spider is completely harmless. Like most spiders, this one is not venomous, but like all animals, it defends itself by biting when it feels threatened. Given its size, its bite seems insignificant. But how did it get from the Caribbean to England?

According to scientists, it travelled thanks to international trade. Due to its tiny size, it could easily fit into suitcases or be transported in international containers. And it clearly liked the Anglo-Saxon climate. It is not the only animal and insect to travel this way; the Asian hornet was also introduced this way.

As a result of climate change, insect invasions are becoming more frequent. The milder climate of the UK's port areas is favouring the establishment of these new specimens. Anasaitis milesae is not the only species to have recently arrived in the European country.

Experts have also observed a Mediterranean spider called Zoropsis spinimana, or 'false wolf spider', in London. Another species identified in the south of the UK is Segestria florentina. This spider has the particularity of having green fangs. Unlike the Caribbean species, these two species are imposing in size and have a painful bite. And just like Anasaitis milesae, they are not dangerous to humans.",['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
622,PT_143.txt,"""The fight against climate change is not on the ballot"". Young man from Climáximo interrupts debate between party leaders

The debate between the eight party leaders with seats in parliament had begun four minutes ago when it was interrupted by a young man from the Climáximo activist movement. ""The fight against climate change is not on the ballot, it is in the hands of the people"", shouted the protester, who invaded the studio that RTP had set up at the Nova SBE university in Carcavelos and stood in front of the moderator, journalist Carlos Daniel.

The young man was immediately removed by a member of the production team, at a time when Pedro Nuno Santos, leader of the PS, was explaining the scenarios he advocates for governability for the country after the legislative elections on 10 March.

Shortly afterwards, when the PSD president, Luís Montenegro, was being questioned, more voices from climate protesters could be heard in the background, which led Carlos Daniel to mention that some protests were still ongoing “from some people who understood that this was the moment to bring their message to the public space”. “This is no longer a novelty in the country, but we will keep the debate within what was planned”, he added.

The Climáximo protesters also painted the windows behind the candidates with red paint. In a statement to which Observador had access, the group stated that the protest “aimed to interrupt the normality of electoral debates that ignore the climate crisis and whose plans” lead “to climate collapse: water shortages for people, losses in agriculture and food production, deaths due to unbearable heat waves, displacements due to deadly fires”.

António Assunção, spokesperson for Climáximo, says that “in these elections, not only is stopping the climate crisis not the main issue, but no party — with or without seats in parliament — has presented a plan that is compatible with the limits of nature”. “Failing to implement” cuts of “at least” 75% of emissions by 2030 is “guaranteeing climate and civilizational collapse”, he believes.

“We cannot allow them to continue to lead us to climate hell. All parties are deliberately reiterating their declaration of war against people. Society must resist and fight to stop the climate crisis”, adds the spokesperson, who reiterates that the group believes that an “alternative” to stopping the climate crisis is “on the streets, not at the ballot box”.

In the statement released this Friday, Climáximo recalls that over the last week it has been altering the billboards of several parties, by placing the phrase “with your vote we guarantee climate collapse”.

Observador awaits a response from RTP to the questions posed. Authorities are already at the scene, about an hour after the incident. The PSP of Carcavelos, in a previous telephone contact, said it could not provide any information about the possible arrest of the protesters.",['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities'],['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The European Union's top diplomat Josep Borrell on Monday pulled out of Hungary a meeting of EU foreign ministers that was due to take place in Budapest, in a response to the bloc's rapprochement with Russia over the war in Ukraine.

Borrell said the meeting in late August would now take place in Brussels, after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán visited Moscow and Beijing without EU support and said his government had defined European policy as ""pro-war"".

""We have to send a signal, even if it is symbolic,"" Borrell told reporters in Brussels at the last meeting of foreign ministers before the summer break.

Orbán began the trip, which also included a visit to US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, just days after Hungary took over the rotating EU presidency on 1 July. At Monday's meeting, several foreign ministers expressed strong condemnation of Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, officials said. ""This was done very clearly and repeatedly to leave no room for doubt,"" Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel said. Several European countries see Hungary as too close to Moscow, undermining EU efforts to isolate Russia politically and diplomatically over its invasion of Ukraine. Hungary says it seeks to bring peace to Ukraine as quickly as possible.","['URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

1. The rector of the University of Coimbra believes he can fire the director of the Russian Studies Centre at that University with the same arbitrariness with which any boss of a small company fires a young person on probation. There is no disciplinary process, there are no facts to justify it. There is the fact that the dismissed director is Russian and there is the report made by two Ukrainians that the director recommends books by Russian authors and has an opinion on the war in Ukraine that does not coincide with that of the informants.

In all the news that has come to light about this dismissal, carried out outside of any legal process, which is serious in a public institution, there are no other facts to justify it other than the author's nationality and the report about his opinions.

It is clear that we are facing a gross violation of Article 13 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, according to which no one may be harmed or deprived of any right on the grounds of their language, territory of origin, religion, political or ideological beliefs.

That the Ukrainian whistleblowers ignore the Portuguese Constitution and the democratic rights it enshrines does not surprise me, but that the rector of a university should be the one to promote the summary dismissal of a professor based on his nationality and for a crime of opinion is something that surprises me, outrages me, and which I consider to be a disgrace to a university whose prestige should be defended. If we were not living in the climate of witch hunt that has been imposed on this western corner of the world, the news of a rector who, in an act of total arrogance, summarily dismisses a professor, violating his fundamental rights with the same degree of carelessness with which he bans beef in canteens, would be the cause of national and international scandal.

2. Manuel Pires da Rocha is a prestigious Portuguese musician and music teacher. He is publicly known as the violinist of the Victor Jara Brigade, but he has a past and present of great prestige in music education, namely as a teacher and director of the Coimbra Conservatory. He studied in Moscow, where he obtained a higher education degree in violin and, unlike others, he respects the country where he studied and the people who welcomed him. Last week, Manuel Pires da Rocha was the target of a snitch who identified himself as a “Jew of Ukrainian origins”, who sent an email to the teachers of the Conservatory denouncing his presence at the celebrations of Victory Day over Nazi-fascism in Lisbon. The response to this ignominy was given by Manuel Rocha himself with the intellectual brilliance for which he is renowned and whose reading I highly recommend.

3. These two episodes are added to the one in the Setúbal City Council, where Russian citizens were vilified and even accused of being spies simply because they were Russian and offered to support Ukrainian refugees in Portugal. They are added to the demonstrations by Ukrainian citizens in Portugal displaying flags of Nazi organizations and advocating the outlawing of the PCP. They are added to a drift of political and cultural intolerance that is very dangerous for democracy. As Manuel Rocha wrote in his text, citing the vampires sung by José Afonso who are back, if someone is fooled by their serious appearance and opens the door for them upon arrival, they eat everything and leave nothing.","['URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is associated with nazism']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
625,PT_76.txt,"Russia is giving up on Kharkiv after ‘failure’

Russia is now “throwing everything it has” at the eastern front, Zelenskyy says. Kremlin denies: “Operation is ongoing”.

Just months after Moscow launched the operation, Kharkiv is preparing to see the Russians leave after the “failure” of the offensive with more troops in northeastern Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

According to Zelenskyy’s recent interview, Russia is now “throwing everything it has” at the eastern front, where fighting has intensified near the city of Pokrovsk.

“Their main focus is no longer the entire east, although Sloviansk [a city in northern Donetsk that borders the Kharkiv region] is not excluded,” the Ukrainian leader added.

In June, Zelenskyy had already described the failure of the operation.

“I spoke with the commander-in-chief about the general situation. A very significant result is that the Russian army failed in its operation in Kharkiv. Now we are holding them back as much as possible and destroying Russian units that enter our territory and terrorize the Kharkiv region,” the Ukrainian president said. 

Russia, however, has already denied giving up the territory, according to The Moscow Times. 

“This operation is ongoing and will continue until it is successfully completed,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on July 17. 

In fact, in an update on July 24, Ukrainian forces near the city described the fighting as “tense and difficult.” 

Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv was stormed by about 30,000 Russian troops, who entered several villages and thus reopened the northeastern front of the war. The city lacked the necessary defenses that should have been prepared by now, experts and commanders in the war that has dragged on since 2022 said.",['URW: Praise of Russia'],['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
